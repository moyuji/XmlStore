<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Many members had supposed that the contract stipulated for payment only for the paper used in executing the contract, while it seemed, from the interpretation given to it by the editors of the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> and others, the <rs>State</rs> pays for the entire paper used in printing their daily and country editions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He had made the following estimate of the cost, per week, to the <rs>State</rs>, under this interpretation of the contract, allowing the amount of matter published per day to be <num value="8">eight</num> columns; Composition, <measure n="156dollars" type="currency">$156</measure>; Press Work, <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure>; Reporting, <measure n="360dollars" type="currency">$360</measure>; Folding, <measure n="120.60dollars" type="currency">$120.60</measure>; Paper, <measure n="209dollars" type="currency">$209</measure>; total cost, per week, <measure n="896.60dollars" type="currency">$896.60</measure>;--Although the contract had been made, there existed a difference of opinion among members with respect to that clause; and he hoped a committee would be appointed, composed of men acquainted with the business, if such were to be found in the <rs>Convention</rs>, and that the matter would be definitely settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He would have opposed the proposition for printing the debates had he been in the hall when it was offered, and did vote for its reconsideration; for he thought its effect would be to protract the session interminably, while he doubted not that there was enough newspaper enterprise in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to print all that was necessary to be printed without burdening the <rs>State</rs> with the expense. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>While speeches had been made calculated to inflame excitement against those with whom he hoped we would soon be united, he felt indisposed, however little weight his remarks might have, to be silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The gentleman from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> had said yesterday that this body was not divided into a majority and a minority; but events had shown that there was a majority, and not a very tolerant <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> He alluded to the past unity of the people of this land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Now all was changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We were in the midst of a revolution, which threatens ere long to light up the flames of civil war. The property and lives of Southern people were to be put in jeopardy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He deprecated the sentiments of the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, contemplating party issues on this floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>To the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> he would say that it had been swept down by the power which had swept away the old <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They all went down before the antislavery party of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He denied the position of the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName> that the <rs>Cotton States</rs> sought the aid of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> for a selfish purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> It was a question for some days where the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName> would like to go; but on yesterday he defined his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He believed it was now generally understood that he would not go with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He would sooner see <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> go down among the breakers than have her unite her destinies with her Southern sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He then went on to show that the hobgoblins of direct taxation and a reopening of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade, had been effectually put down by the proceedings of the <rs>Congress</rs> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Even if the slave trade were to be re-opened, how could the slave property of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> be in a worse position than in a Northern Confederacy? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The speaker proceeded to reply to the positions of <persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName>, in regard to the tobacco latest of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and showed that in a confederacy with the <rs>North</rs> the results to the planter would be ruinous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He charged that all the disasters had been brought upon the country by a long series of systematic aggressions by the <rs>Northern</rs> people upon the <rs>South</rs>, commencing in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Subsequently Abolition societies were organized throughout all the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Their emissaries under every guise were sent among us to incite our slaves to insurrection and rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But antislavery even then did not retrace its steps.--A few years later the <rs>National</rs> halls were flooded with petitions for the abolition of slavery, and peace was only restored by concessions of Southern men. In <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, after Southern blood had watered the plains of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, the agitation was again renewed, and to quiet it, the <rs>South</rs> received <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> into the <rs>Union</rs>, with a constitution which virtually excluded us forever from that valuable territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, a band of Northern men, in pursuance of a plan that had long been on foot &mdash; a band of armed men &mdash; made an incursion into <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, to excite insurrection, murder her peaceful citizens, and overthrow the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But this did not arouse the conservative feelings of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The majority of the people there regarded the hero of that invasion as a martyr.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>And now a vast party, called the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, had secured the <rs>National</rs> councils, and elevated <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to the <name>Presidency</name>; and in a few more revolutions of the wheel they would have every department of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The speaker then analyzed the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform, upon which the party rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He inquired whether that party would now consider its duty done and its mission ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He apprehended that it would not, but would go on in its career of madness and folly and crime, until it struck a deadly blow to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.--In connection with this point, he alluded to the higher law and irrepressible conflict doctrines &mdash; the last of which had been proclaimed by <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, in his speeches, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago. <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had told the people that if he were in Congress, and the question of the extermination of slavery was to come up, he would vote for it, in spite of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Thus, through its chosen champions had the party presented to the <rs>South</rs> the alternative of submission and humiliation, or a bold maintenance of her rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He hoped she would choose the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The <rs>North</rs> had rendered a verdict in favor of the doctrines of the <name>Helper</name> book, and in that verdict would inaugurate those doctrines into power at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Thus the strong arm would be uplifted against the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country and against the peace of Southern society. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> Seeing that <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the constitutional barriers had been swept away, some of our Southern sisters had seceded, and set up a government for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It may be that they would move through a pathway of blood, but they possessed the &#x0022;Promethean light that would the sphere relume&#x0022;--they were destined yet to shed a brighter light than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He expressed his ardent hopes for their future glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It was now for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to say where she would go &mdash; whether she would seek an ignoble position in a Northern Confederacy &mdash; stand idly by until <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> her sisters of the <rs>South</rs> had been crushed out, and a military despotism reared upon the rains of a once happy country &mdash; or unite with her sisters and take part in the struggle for her household gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The Southern people were bound to us by every sentiment and by every tie. Their destiny must ultimately be our destiny. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> He proceeded to allude to the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> acts in Congress &mdash; the adoption of the <name>Clark</name> resolutions &mdash; a force bill had passed to its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> reading in the <rs type="place">House</rs> &mdash; and if anything else were wanting, a proposition had been sent from the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName>, which he repudiated in the name of the people whom he represented on this floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>He then proceeded to criticise the <rs>Franklin</rs> proposition, which he looked upon as anything but a guarantee of Southern rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It placed us in a worse position than we already occupied, and he spurned it. His people had been firmly attached to the <rs>Union</rs>, and were prepared to stand around the <rs>Constitution</rs> as long as they who stood last; but they had seen the <rs>Constitution</rs> overpowered by the higher law, and now they were for an eternal dissolution of these States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>All they ask is to be allowed to depart in peace; but if war must come, let it come, and may the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of battles defend the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He did not propose to discuss the right of secession, but contended that the <name>States</name> had the right whenever the compact was violated by parties to it. <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had especially reserved to herself the right to resume her sovereign powers, whenever her rights should be invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>But in any event, they had the right, under the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, to resist oppression and wrong, come from whence they may. <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had none of the responsibility for the present state of affairs &mdash; no stains upon her garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Whatever might be the result, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> could say to the <rs>North</rs>, in the language of <persName n="Macbeth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Macbeth,nomatch:0"><surname>Macbeth</surname></persName> to Banquo, &#x0022;Thou canst not say I did it.&#x0022; </p> </div4>

<head>On guard.<lb/>[concluded.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/> &#x0022;To the right form, sir!&#x0022; cried the sergeant in a loud whisper, but I did not quite catch his meaning, and so thought it simpler to go on a little further. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/> &#x0022;Halt &mdash; front!&#x0022; cried I, and they halted and fronted; but, alas, their <hi rend="italics">backs</hi> were turned to the old guard, in whose ranks, I think, I heard an insubordinate giggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> However, I counter-marched my men, and then the old guard presented arms to us, and we presented arms to the old guard; and some of the new guard were marched off to relieve the sentries, and I apologized to the old guard officer, a youth of <num value="18">eighteen</num>, who graciously patronized me, and told me that I should do better another time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>He also kindly gave me a tip for the <rs>Cambridgeshire Stakes</rs>, and imparted other valuable information, until, all his sentries being gathered in, he marched his party off, and behind him were closed and barred those gates beyond which it was unlawful for me to pass for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> As a general rule, the fact of being confined in any particular place, however pleasant, would make me long to get out of it, but at present I had no such wish, for the novelty of the position had a romantic charm about it which quite reconciled me to the imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/><num value="22">Twenty-two</num> marines, some of them bronzed and decorated men, who had braved for several years the battle and the breeze, were under my command; and it was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taste of power, for being a quiet man and a hen-pecked, it had never occurred to me to exercise authority at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Then I was in a responsible position; no <num value="1">one</num> could come into the dock-yard without my permission, and if he insisted on forcing his way by climbing over the wall or otherwise, I might &mdash; might I order him to be bayoneted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Yes; I might certainly do so, and the sentry would probably obey me, but should I be hung for giving such an order? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> This being a point worthy of serious consideration, I took the board of orders down from the mantel-piece, and seating myself on a truckle-bed, which, with a table, <num value="2">two</num> chairs, an inkstand, a pen a grate, a <rs n="coal scuttle" type="product">coal-scuttle</rs>, and a broken poker, formed the furniture of the guard-room, commenced an investigation of the duties of my position, which led to a further reverie upon my present dignity, and the magnitude of the interests confided to my charge; <num value="1">one</num> of them being a powder-magazine of so ticklish a constitution that the smoking of a pipe in the guard-room, <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile off, could not be indulged in without running the risk of blowing up half the town, with a fair proportion of those gun-boats and frigates for which we pay such a tidy little bill every year; and the idea of the bare possibility of the taxes of the country being increased by any such negligence of mine, made me shudder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>While cogitating in this way, I began to experience certain uneasy sensations in the region of the stomach, which by and by resolved themselves into a yearning for tea, and bread and butter, and in due time it occurred to me that I had not breakfasted.--What was to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>I had not seen my servant before leaving the barrack square, and as I had selected the lad for his honesty rather than his intelligence, I knew he would never come to look after me without express orders to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>I must have patience; but yet what was the use of that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>Patience is a very good thing for the toothache, because <num value="1">one</num> lives in hopes of its going off; but hunger never &#x0022;goes off.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/> Well, well, it was no great hardship after all to go without breakfast for once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>The worst of it was, that the difficulty would recur at dinner-time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/> These dismal reflections were broken in upon by the sergeant, who appeared at the doorway, and asked if I would choose to visit the sentries, which I forth with began to do; and as I varied the amusement by investigations of all the objects of interest in the place, it took me a couple of hours to go the rounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all, I came to a large building where boiler-plates were being drilled round the edges with small holes for the rivets, and I stood for a long time watching the punch pressing out the little circular bits of iron with that ease and neatness peculiar to the irresistible force of steam, till a workman of whom I asked some question remarked, that &#x0022;<num value="1">one</num> would think it was going into so much cheese,&#x0022; and the mention of that comestible was too much for a famished <persName><foreName>Welshman</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Not far from this workshop, I came upon my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sentry, who ported arms and proceeded to repeat his orders, which were printed up in his sentry-box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>There were under his care a crow-bar, which he was to give up when requested to the dock-yard police, and a lifeboat, which he was to throw to any <num value="1">one</num> whom he saw struggling in the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>He was also to challenge any <num value="1">one</num> who approached his post after dark; to fire off a blank cartridge in case of fire; and, above all, to allow no <num value="1">one</num> to smoke either on the wharf or on board the shipping moored off it. All this he repeated in a breath, like a child saying its catechism; and I passed on, and spent half an hour in watching the prodigies performed by a Volcanic hammer, though, if <placeName reg="Fort Vulcan">Vulcan</placeName> can hit half as hard as that, I pity poor <persName n="Venus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="mostcommon:Venus,nomatch:0"><surname>Venus</surname></persName> when he comes home jealous and nectary.--Then came an interview with another sentry, then I watched the process of razzing a <num value="3">three</num>-decker that would not sail into a frigate that would: after which came more sentries, all of whom told their little tale so exactly in the same way, that I grew weary and determined to &#x0022;dodge&#x0022; the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>This was a tall, sturdy, red-faced lad, evidently not long from the plough, who, when I came upon him round a corner, was standing gazing into his sentry-box, reading the orders there printed up, evidently cramming for his approaching examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>On hearing my footsteps, he faced about, and ported his arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/> &#x0022;Do you know your orders?&#x0022; said I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/></p> 
<p> &#x0022;Yes, sir,&#x0022; he replied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/> &#x0022;Well, then, if a man fell off that vessel into the water, and you saw that he was drowning, what would you do?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/> Poor fellow!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>I never saw more utter and hopeless bewilderment expressed on mortal face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>I repeated the question in as clear and simple a way as I could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/> &#x0022;Give' un the crow-bar!&#x0022; he at length replied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/> I tried to explain to him the inutility of a crow-bar to a drowning man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/> &#x0022;Fire a blank cartridge at 'un!&#x0022; was his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> guess, and I gave him up in despair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Only after that, I did not walk so close to the edge of the quay as I had been previously doing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> At some little distance from the workshops and dry docks, but close to the water-edge, stood a square, low, windowless stone-building, encompassed on the land-side by a dry moat, in which perambulated a marine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>This stone-building was the <name>Magazine</name>, and as my board of orders directed me to examine whether there were any marks of lucifer-matches on the walls, I descended into the moat, and commenced a careful scrutiny. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> &#x0022;The door is round here, sir!&#x0022; cried the astonished sergeant, evidently thinking that I was searching for the entrance, which was certainly small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>On my rejoining him, he pulled an iron handle, which produced a distant ghostly tinkle, and it was not without a certain trepidation that I heard a footstep, and the jingling of many keys, for I expected, on entering, to find myself in a low dark vault piled with loose gunpowder, as a granary is with corn, and was rather disappointed although relieved, when the <unclear>guarun</unclear> of the place ushered me into an open courtyard, surrounded by stone cells with iron doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>When I had interrogated the sentry who was pacing this court, I was conducted through <num value="2">two</num> gates, which were carefully locked behind us, to a dismal place where were a flight of steps leading down to the water, and here another sentry was posted, whom I pitied; for I should not myself like to be locked out from the world by <num value="3">three</num> doors in such a place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>But what of the man with the keys, who let me in and conducted me round?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Does he live in that place?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Has he a wife and family anywhere?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Is his life insured; and if so, is it in a fire or life office, and what premium does he pay?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Has he ever known the joys of tobacco?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Is it lawful for him to feed upon anything more inflammatory that the <rs>Revalenta Arabica</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/> I own that I breathed more freely as, stepping out of the <name>Magazine</name>, and taking my sword, which I had to leave outside, from the sergeant, I bent my steps back to the guard-room. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/> The walk had been highly interesting, but it had sharpened my appetite woefully. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/> I had no books, but my predecessor had fortunately left behind him a plentiful supply of writing-paper, with which I proceeded to draw up the report which had to be sent in on the following morning, culling the different parts of it from various forms which were hung about the room, with a glorious uncertainty about what was for my own private instruction, and what for the official information of my superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>This whiled away some time, and then an admiral came into the yard, and the guard had to be turned out in his honor; after which it was time to revisit the sentries; and so the day wore away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>Night came, and I was left alone with <num value="2">two</num> tallow dips, and my own reflections, which were these of a pike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Yet I might have sat down to a dinner a <foreign lang="fre">la Russe,</foreign> for was it not open to me to devour those tallow dips?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>True; but I am a man who thinks slowly, and must confess that the idea did not occur to me. I was now tired as well as hungry, which would have been the greatest of boons, could I have gone to sleep; but this I dared not do, for the field-officer might come on his rounds at any minute, and I had made mistakes enough in the morning, without adding to those misdemeanors a lack of vigilance, which would keep a superior waiting at night; so I selected the hardest chair, placed a pebble on it, laid my sword and shako on the table in such a position that they could be caught up at a moment's notice, and commenced a game at tit-tat-toe, single-handed; but finding that this pastime of my childhood was not so exciting as memory had painted it, I exchanged it for the solution of very long and hard sums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The officer I had relieved in the morning had informed me that the F. O. generally came at <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> about midnight, so that there was not so much time to kill; and though the hours seemed to be paying me the compliment of approaching in slow time, <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> came at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>No rounds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/><time value="1oclock">One o'clock</time>. No rounds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/> I then remembered that there was a ball going on at the port admiral's, and that, most likely, the field-officer was there, and would take me on his way home; so, with a sign at the thought that at that moment he was probably sitting down to supper, I began another sum.-- &#x0022;If a major who has dined at <num value="7">seven</num>, and danced till <num value="1">one</num>, can eat <num value="2">two</num> wings of a chicken <num value="3">three</num> ounces of ham, <num value="4">four</num> plovers' eggs, and a roll, how much can a subaltern, who has fasted for <measure n="30hours" type="date">thirty hours</measure>, eat?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> <time value="2oclock">Two o'clock</time>. The pebble beginning to make itself unpleasant, I unwisely removed it, and almost instantly lost sight of paper and figures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/> &#x0022;Guard, turn out!&#x0022; cried the sentry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> I jumped up, overturned the table, grasped my sword and shako, which I put on hindside before, I rushed out of the room, and just reached my place in time to receive the F. O. properly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/> &#x0022;All right, sir?&#x0022; said he. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> &#x0022;All right, sir,&#x0022; said I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/></p> 
<p> &#x0022;All present?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/> &#x0022;All present.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/> &#x0022;Good-night;&#x0022; and he turned his horse's head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>At that moment, an unlucky marine who had been unable, on <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> waking, to find his musket, came tumbling out of the guardroom, and took his place in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>The officer turned upon me like a wasp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/> &#x0022;I thought you said they were all present, sir!&#x0022; said he. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> &#x0022;I did not see&#x0022;--I began. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/> &#x0022;Then you ought to have seen; mind you are more careful another time.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> This was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, that I had been told before all my men, that I &#x0022;ought to have seen;&#x0022; and this time the reprimand came from a man at least <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> my junior, for I had recognized an <orgName n="Old School" type="school">old school</orgName>-fellow who had been my fag. However, I was too sleepy to suffer much from shame or indignation, so I paid <num value="1">one</num> more visit to my sentries, and threw myself on the truckle-bed, where I slept hard until roused in the morning by an orderly who had come for my report. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> Alas, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>in knocking over the table the night before, I had spilt the ink all over that unhappy document, and there was no time to copy it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>It was hurried away, like poor <placeName key="possibilities=16" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Hamlet</placeName>'s father, with all its blots upon it, and was consequently doomed, like that famous ghost, to wander about and haunt me; for, as it turned out, I had by no means seen the last of that orderly, who kept bringing me curt messages and rejected manuscripts all day.--However, he went off for the time, and shortly afterwards the new guard arrived, and soon I was wending my happy way to barracks and to breakfast.--<hi rend="italics"><persName n="Chambers,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="mostcommon:Chambers,nomatch:0"><surname>Chambers</surname></persName>' Journal.</hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
