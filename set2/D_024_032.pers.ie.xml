<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Here they laid until the moon (which was shining brightly) went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>A correspondent, who was on board the <rs type="ship">Palmetto State</rs>, furnishes the <hi rend="italics">Courier</hi> with the following account of the affair: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> At <time value="4:30am">4.30 A. M.</time> the <rs>Palmetto State</rs> crossed the bar, and stood out at sea in the direction of the blockading fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>At <time value="5:20am">5.20 A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Watch &mdash; What steamer is that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Drop your anchor &mdash; back &mdash; back &mdash; and be careful, or you will run into us. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> As the answer was given the <rs>Palmetto State</rs>, with full steam up, ran into the <rs>Mercedita</rs>, the bow striking her right about midships and making an entrance of about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure>. At the same time our bow gun was fired with a <measure n="7inch" type="distance">seven-inch</measure> incendiary shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We immediately backed out, when the <rs>Mercedita</rs> hauled down her flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They were ordered to send a boat to us, and <persName n="Abbott,Lieutenant,T.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Abbott,T.,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Abbott</surname></persName>, commanding, came off with a boat's crew and surrendered his vessel in the name of <persName n="Stollwagon,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stollwagon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Com.</roleName> <surname>Stollwagon</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Mercedita</rs>, carrying <num value="7">7</num> guns and <num value="153">153</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A shot had pierced her boiler, which had burst and scalded a large number of men. <persName n="Abbott,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Abbott,T.,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Abbott</surname></persName> begged <persName n="Ingraham,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Ingraham,Duncan,N.,,:1"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Ingraham</surname></persName> to take the men with him on board the <rs type="ship">Palmetto State</rs>, as in their haste to come to us they had neglected to put in the plug, and their small boat was only kept afloat by the strenuous efforts of the men bailing the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The <rs>Mercedita</rs> was taken completely by surprise.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The Palmetto State, leaving the <rs>Mercedita</rs> to her fate, stood out to sea, and engaged several other vessels of the <name>Abolition</name> blockading fleet, occasionally exchanging shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The latter, however followed the example of her companions and fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Wethen stood northward, towards the <rs>Chicora</rs>, which at this time was almost surrounded by the enemy's vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At <time value="8am">8 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>On passing we were saluted by <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Forts Moultrie</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,2054459" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Ripley, Crow Wing, Minnesota">Ripley</placeName>, and arrived at the wharf in the city a little before <time value="6pm">6 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The Palmetto State engaged an Abolition vessel on the right, while we engaged the <num value="1">one</num> on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>As we passed the blockader on the right, the <rs>Palmetto State</rs> was laying along-side of her. Keeping on our course, we proceeded to within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of the vessel on the left, and then gave her a shot from our bow gun, the blockade at the time being under full headway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We rounded to and gave her the full benefit of our broadside guns and after gun. She immediately rang her ball for fire and made signals of distress to the rest of the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The last seen of her by <persName n="Saunders,Signal Officer,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Saunders,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Signal Officer">signal officer</roleName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName>, she was stern down very low in the water, and disappeared very suddenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>This vessel is supposed to have gone down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Notwithstanding the <rs>Chicora</rs> immediately steamed towards her, nothing could be discovered of the vessel. </p> </q><bibl n="Another correspondent of the same paper on the Chicora"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <rs>Chicora</rs>, proceeding farther out to sea, stood Northward and Eastward, and met <num value="2">two</num> vessels apparently coming to the relief of the missing steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We engaged them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, after firing a few guns, withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Standing to the <name>Northward</name>, about daybreak, we steamed up to a small side wheel <num value="2">two</num>-masted steamer and endeavored to come to close quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>She kept clear of us, driving away as rapidly as possible, not, however, without receiving our compliments and carrying with her <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> of our shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Shortly after the <term type="ship">steamship</term> <rs type="ship">Quaker</rs> City and another side wheel steamer came gallantly bearing down on the <rs>Chicora</rs> and commenced firing at long range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Neither would permit our boat to get within a respectable distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><num value="2">Two</num> of our shoes struck the <rs n="Quaker" type="religion">Quaker</rs> City, and she left apparently perfectly satisfied, in a crippled condition.

We fired our forward pivot gun with an incendiary shell, and struck her just forward of her wheel-house, setting her on fire, disabling and stopping her port wheel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This vessel was fired both fore and aft, and volumes of smoke was observed to issue from every aperture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>As we neared her, she hauled down her flag and made a signal of surrender, but still kept underway with her starboard wheel and changing her direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>This was just after daybreak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>We succeeded in catching this vessel, but, having surrendered, and the captain supposing her bolters struck and the escaping steam preventing the engineers from going into the engine room to stop her, ordered us not to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>She thus made her escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>After this vessel had got out of our reach to the perfectly safe distance of about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, she fired her last rifled gun, regain hoisted her flag and setting all sails, fired her rifled gun repeatedly at us as she left. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Discovering that the <term type="ship">flag-boat</term>, <rs type="ship">Palmetto State</rs> had ceased firing and was standing in shore, orders were given to follow her. On our return, we again came across a <num value="3">three</num>-masted bark-rigged vessel, which we engaged, firing our guns as we passed, striking her once or twice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We then kept on our course to the bar, having sustained no damage in the action nor a single casualty on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The last ship mentioned above kept firing at us until we got out of range, and we giving them our return compliments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><num value="1">One</num> of the blockaders was certainly sunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>We engaged her at the distance of only <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, and she settled down with her stern clear under water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The <rs>Chicora</rs> anchored in <placeName reg="Beach Channel, Queens, New York" key="tgn,1114081">Beach Channel</placeName> at <time value="8:30am">8.30 A.
