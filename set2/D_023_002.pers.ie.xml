<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In the course of an hour the enemy were repulsed, leaving <num value="3">three</num> of their fine guns on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Skirmishers were then advanced beyond the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The cavalry followed, and on reaching the other side went forward in advance and took position on the hill on which <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Mott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Mott,nomatch:0"><surname>Mott</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> had been stationed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Discovering the enemy in force to their right, and batteries being placed in position behind some houses, the cavalry fell back across the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>After a short time the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> batteries opened again from the same position, our batteries replying, and the fight continued till night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>At dark, a fatigue party was detailed to repair the bridge, the enemy continuing to throw canister and shell across the bridge till after <time value="12am">midnight</time>, preventing the fatigue party from accomplishing anything. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> About <time value="2am">2 o'clock, A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> <num value="1">One</num> fine <name type="weapon">Parrott gun</name> fell into our hands, and a number of horsed and mules, some with artillery harness on. The houses behind which the <rs>Federal</rs> imperious had been placed were found, upon examination, to less perforated with our shot, evidently shown, that the enemy had lost heavily at their batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the morning the bridge was speedily repaired, and the forces of <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Hill,D.,H.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Hester,Aun,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> were again in pursuit of the foe.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> a severe fight came off near the intersection of the <rs type="place">Darbytown</rs> and <address><street n="Charles City road">Charles City roads</street></address>. About <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, the <orgName>division of <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName></orgName> came up with the enemy at that point who were in strong force and position, and a battle, farce and desperate, ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The enemy are represented to have resisted the valorous onsets of our troops with more desperate determination and greater bravery than in any other of the series of engagements which have occurred since the opening of the grand ball on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Their pieces were admirably served, and during the whole engagement while insisted from <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> until <num value="9">9</num>, they struggled with the energy of desperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>So fierce was the fire of their artillery and small arms, that <num value="3">three</num> successive attempts were made by our forces before the enemy were finally dislodged from their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Around their pieces a severe hand-to-hand fight occurred, and they were only driven back at the point of the bayonet by the resistless charges of our Southern soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Our artillery ammunition having been exhausted immediately after their entrenchments were carried, prevented the rout from being a complete <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Our troops, fatigued and worn down by hard marching and heavy fighting, remained during the night in the captured entrenchments, from whence they renewed the pursuit of the retreating foe at day dawn, yesterday morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The losses on both sides in this battle were very heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>An eye-witness informs us that the field was literally strewn with the dead and wounded of the contending parties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Hard as was the struggle, and heavy as our loss unquestionably was, the victory rested with our troops, and adds another to the series of brilliant successes that have crowned the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The numbers killed and wounded in this fight are variously estimated &mdash; some estimates placing our Josses high as <num value="1500">1,500</num>, and the loss of the enemy at from <num value="5000">5,000</num> to <num value="7000">7,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>These figures seem almost incredible, but that the loss is very great, as we have already stated, cannot be denied. </p> </div4>

<head>Yesterday's operations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The fighting was renewed again in the early part of the day yesterday, and continued almost without intermission until late in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Up to <time value="2pm">2 o'clock P. M.</time>, our forces had pressed the enemy back a distance of over <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, and were pouring into their <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> a most fatal and destructive fire.--Their ranks were being terribly thinned, but still they maintained their organization, and were covering the retreat of their Grand Army with commendable zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Such seems to be the discipline or desperation of their forces that it is scarcely possible to effect a complete rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Whatever may have been the conclusions arrived at on account of their successive defeats for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> of this long and bloody conflict, they are certainly now contesting the ground with an earnestness that betokens either thorough discipline or utter desperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But their prestige is gone, and though many of their numbers may succeed in making their escape, the whole <rs>North</rs> must feel and acknowledge the mortification of a crushing and overwhelming defeat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> It was impossible for us to learn the entire results of yesterday's operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We can only assure our readers that they are not less successful than have been the previous efforts of our brave troops and that night closed with the <rs>Union</rs> forces still retreating, and our own steadily and surely <q>&#x0022;pressing them to the wall.&#x0022;</q> The supposition still is that they are endeavoring to force their way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and that their only hope is that transports will be in readiness to receive at least a portion of their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Taking this view of the case, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them are likely to leave their bones to bleach on the bill sides and low lands of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Large numbers will doubtless find their way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, to be fed and fattened at the expense of the <rs>Government</rs> whose subjugation they have sought to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The guns of the enemy were not very heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>They sounded like <num value="12">12</num> and <num value="24">24</num> pounders, and subsequent examination proved they were such. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The <rs type="place">Mound City</rs> fired her how guns twice, and then her port guns, as she steamed up the river <unclear></unclear> little further, making the distance between her <unclear></unclear> and the <orgName n="Upper Battery" type="battery">upper battery</orgName>, less than half a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> fortification was on the same bluff or <unclear>r </unclear> that its follow was, but a little further from the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> fortification was on the same bluff or ridden that its fellow was, but a little farther from <unclear> </unclear> shore, and in a southwesterly direction from that flag ship, preventing its guns from bearing directly on the <rs type="place">Mound City</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The effect of the flag ship's shots could not be well determined, but they appeared to be falling when the gunners desired, and the cannonade on her port, as well as on that of the <rs>St. Louis</rs>, was warmly kept up for <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>, less than <num value="20">twenty</num> having elapsed since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun had been fired from the <orgName n="Lower Battery" type="battery">lower battery</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>He was already on the march, and had signaled the <rs type="place">Mound City</rs> to coarse firing, that his own men might not be injured, when an unanticipated accident, of the most horrible character, almost entirely destroyed the officers and crew of the flag-ship. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> A large cylindrical shot, with iron flanges on each side, known among the rebels as the pigment shot, struck the casement on the port side, in the upper port, near the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun, at an angle of about <num value="90">ninety</num> degrees; passing through the casement and connecting pipe of the bollers, killing a gunner on the starboard side, and alighting in the steward's pantry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The effect of severing the connecting pipe may be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>All the steam of the bollers at once rushed with a shrill, hissing sound into every part of the gunboat, which presented no means for its escape except through the port holes and sky lights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>It was like injecting steam into an air-light box, and when we remember there were nearly <num value="180">one hundred and eighty</num> human beings below the deck the ineffable horror of their situation may readily be seen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The burning steam fairly mowed them down.--They shrieked, and leaped, and writhed in pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>But the steam did not pity their fortunes; it seemed rather to delight in their sufferings, and extended its vaporous torrents to new victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Horrors upon horrors accumulated in that low, square, seething, boiling, ferry enclosure, where man endured all the fabled agonies of the damned, and yet could not die. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> To some, Fate was merciful; for it slew them at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>As many as <num value="45">forty five</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num>, who had stood on the gun-deck a few moments before with buoyant hopes and elated spirits, lay there in crimson death, unconscious of the pain of those around them, unhearing &mdash; O how fortunately ! --the terrible moaning and groaning of the wounded sufferers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> As soon as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shock had passed, those who had not been slain from full inhalation of the steam were prompted, mad with pain, to leap into the river to cool their burning bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The impulse appeared to seize upon all simultaneously, and out of the open ports plunged <num value="1">one</num> wretch after another, until <num value="70">seventy</num> or <num value="80">eighty</num> were struggling in the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Some were so badly scalded that they could not swim, and they, most fortunately, were drowned; while others, refreshed and cooled by the river, struck out manfully to the shore, as if they had been uninjured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> At this crisis when every principle of humanity called for aid and succor, the rebels proved themselves worthy of the antecedents that have dishonored and disgraced them from the beginning of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> Instead of imitating the example of generosity and magnanimity set them by a brave and loyal people, struggling for the preservation of a great and glorious country; forgetting the heroic conduct shown by our seamen, who endeavored, in the gunboat fight off <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, to save the lives of the unfortunate crew of the <rs>General Lovell</rs> when she went down, the rebels, meanly, mercilessly, and dastardly, made every effort to destroy the poor scalded fellows who were seeking to reach the shore or our vessels with their burned and suffering limbs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The gunners in the <orgName n="Upper Battery" type="battery">upper battery</orgName> turned their guns upon the suffering officers and seamen of the <rs type="place">Mound City</rs>, and <persName n="Fry,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00429" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Fry</surname></persName>, the commander of the works, ordered his sharp-shooters to kill every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> before he could reach the shore or succor could be brought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The devilish enemy needed no <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> bidding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>He ran with alacrity down to the boat, and there, under cover of the trees, fired muskets and <unclear></unclear> the wounded swimmers, with a cool diabolism that a savage South Sea Islander would have blushed to witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Many a brave fellow was killed and sunk in the river, and others were wounded several times before they obtained the needful aid from their loyal friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The <rs type="place">Mound City</rs> was powerless and drifting with the current; she could not aid them; and the <rs>St. Louis</rs> was then opposite the lower fortification. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The Conestoga, which was just below the <rs type="place">Mound City</rs>, promptly lowered <num value="2">two</num> of her boats, and sent them to save the survivers of the horrible accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>No sooner had the gigs been manned, and no sooner were the sailors pulling at their care on the divine errand of mercy, than the upper work blazed with its heavy guns at the succorers of distress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The Union gigs were struck twice, <num value="1">one</num> in the bow and the other in the stern; but, strange to say, they were not swamped, nor were they prevented from rescuing from the river some of the ill fated crew. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> <num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> boat, from the <rs>St. Louis</rs>, I believe, was struck with rebel shot and shattered in pieces, but none of the inmates were hurt or drowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The enemy was still bent on their demonize work, and would have fired his last cartridge at the defenseless sailors, had not the brave <rs>Indianian</rs>, under <persName n="Fitch,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00430" reg="mostcommon:Fitch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Fitch</surname></persName>, succeeded by this time in reaching the rear of the fortification, where <persName n="Fry,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00431" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0"><surname>Fry</surname></persName> commanded, and arrested the labor of destruction. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="IN46">46th Indiana</orgName> rushed with a shout and a volley of musketry into the hostile works, and then charged with bayonets upon the inhuman fee. The rebels were completely taken by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Before they had time to throw down their arms or cry for quarter they were lying in the entrenchments and their lifeblood ebbing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Some of the <name>Secessionists</name> fought with dogged obstinacy against superior numbers, and fell covered with ghastly wounds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> Those of the rebels along the shore who had been firing at the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> in the water were soon charged upon by the <name>Indianian</name>, for whom they did not wait, but took to flight along the bank towards the village of <placeName reg="Saint Charles, Arkansas, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009434">St. Charles</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>A portion of the insurgents ran to a place above where the river had been obstructed, and jumping into a few small boats they had moored there, crossed the stream and disappeared in the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The rout was complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The victory was cures but, alas ! at what a price. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> At least <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="200">two hundred</num> of the rebels must have been killed and wounded, nearly all of the number having been slain.
