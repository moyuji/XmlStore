<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> A Paris letter, published in the <rs>Northern</rs> papers <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago, furnishes a report that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> intend, after the <date value="03-04">4th of March next</date>, to recognize <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and to recognize the <rs>South</rs> as an independent nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We have not a word to say against the <rs>Paris</rs> letter writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We recognize <hi rend="italics">their</hi> independence without hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They are independent in their income, and have never owed allegiance to truth or probabilities at any time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>A more comfortable berth than that of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> letter writer for a London journal is not easily found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><measure n="20years" type="date">Twenty years</measure> ago a letter-writer could live quite comfortably there for <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The salary even of subordinates was <num value="3">three</num> guineas a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Expenses are heavier in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> now, but salaries have probably risen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><measure n="4hours" type="date">Four hours</measure> a day would be a large allowance of work for them, and the remainder of the <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> is disposable for loafing and lying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In such a city as <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, young men of education, who have found the bar in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> a rather rough and toilsome way of climbing to distinction find no difficulty in refreshing themselves after the arduous labors of their correspondence, and leading, on the whole, a luxurious and effervescent life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Of course, they are expected to render a <hi rend="italics">quid pro quo;</hi> not to be altogether lilies of the valley &mdash; to be useful not less than ornamental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <name>English</name> breakfast table, with its tea and toast, would furnish meagre entertainment but for side dishes of gossip and scandal set forth by the newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The letter writers are expected to entertain <persName n="Bull,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bull,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> with a sensation before he goes to Change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Public affairs and private affairs must be served hot, smoking and savory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There is no such <hi rend="italics">chef de cuisine</hi> in all <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> as &#x0022;Our Own Correspondent.&#x0022; He will make the best of soups out of bones, and convert a frog into a chicken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We remember an <hi rend="italics">attache</hi> of a London press, who visited the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in the beginning of the war. Up to that time, we had supposed no <num value="1">one</num> could approach an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> letter-writer in fishing up minnows, and, by fertility of genius, transforming them into whales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> beat our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> news- hunters at their own weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>His pen had the flexibility of an elephant's trunk, and could pluck a geranium or pull up a tree with equal facility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We do not know what has become of him. He deserved to be promoted to the Paris-letter staff. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> letter-writers do not earn their bread in idleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They manage the affairs of all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They have uninterrupted access to all the <name>Cabinets</name>, especially the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>That impassive and inscrutable monarch, whose purposes the shrewdest diplomatists endeavor in vain to fathom, unbosoms himself with the artlessness of a child to the <rs>Paris</rs> letter-writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In their presence he relaxes that grim secretiveness which his own ministers often fail to unlock, and, in strict secrecy between gentlemen, you know, relieves his burthened <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> mind to the men of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>That isolated soul of his comes out of its icy, solitary cell, and basks in the warm sunshine of mutual confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is atrocious, that, after all this, they blab the next day every word he has told them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They do not deserve to be trusted with any more secrets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> As to other continental Powers, they can keep nothing from the <num value="100">hundred</num> eyes and trumpet tongues of the <rs>London</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They do not even pretend to.-- The <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> letter-writers know their policy before they know it themselves, and publish it accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Sometimes they admonish them in solemn tones of the errors of their way, and castigate them sharply if they do not reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They swing the knout over the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> with as little reluctance as he would employ it upon <num value="1">one</num> of his own serfs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We believe that if the <rs>Czar Peter</rs> were alive, they would not hesitate, upon proper occasion, to scarify his tough epidermis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We should like to see him scratching himself after <num value="1">one</num> of these flagellations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Of course, it would not be expected that these high and mighty potentates should be ignorant of the purposes of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> towards this benighted hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> are going to recognize both <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> has told the letter-writers so in <num value="1">one</num> of those cozy, confidential <hi rend="italics">tete a-tetes</hi> which they have over their wine in the hotel <rs>Pouissin</rs>.--What an artless, gossipping old gentleman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>And how abominable that his confidence should be so abused!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But perhaps it is their sweet simplicity which has been victimized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Perhaps the venerable <rs>Slyboots</rs> was in his cups, and was joyously chaffing these pretty carrier pigeons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We have a faint recollection of having heard reports of Recognition before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Nevertheless, the letter-writers give a date this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We are to be recognized &#x0022;after the <date value="03-04">4th of March next</date>&#x0022;--<hi rend="italics">after</hi>, we doubt not, and when we are no longer able to recognize ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> In the meantime, we shall try to be patient, hopeful and belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Our faith is a very robust and vigorous faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>There are few achievements which it is not equal to. We can believe in a great many things; we can wrestle manfully with all manner of doubts and perplexities, but must, we confess it, when we are called upon to believe a Paris letter-writer, knock under; we hoist the white flag; no gullet of human credulity can perform such a feat and survive. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> We presented to our readers a few days ago an extract from the autobiography of <persName n="Scott,,Winfield,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Scott,Winfield,,,"><foreName>Winfield</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, that illustrious defunct, who has been lying in state, in a fine hotel in New York, since the beginning of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The paragraph copied in the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> is an attack upon old <persName n="Taylor,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Zachary,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, commonly called &#x0022;Rough and Ready,&#x0022; whom <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Winfield,,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>, the greatest man alive or dead, in his own estimation, disposes of, now that <persName n="Taylor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Zachary,,,"><surname>Taylor</surname></persName> is dead, in a truculent and merciless fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We have nothing to say of the good taste of making a hyena-like descent into the tomb of an old comrade in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This is a thing eminently in <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Winfield,,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>But, whilst he is endeavoring to make <persName n="Taylor,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Zachary,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> ridiculous, he treats his readers to an exhibition of characteristic complacency and pretension that throws completely into the shade honest Old Zach's defects and prejudices, and makes them quite dignified and respectable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> In what we have to say on this subject we are not governed by antipathies to <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Winfield,,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> because of his Unionism.
