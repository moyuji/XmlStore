<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>There are, it is true, some few individuals whose sentiments thoroughly coincide with those of the dominant faction in the <rs>North</rs>, and who would be content to witness the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They can not bring themselves to the belief that the <rs>Union</rs> is destroyed; they cannot forego the hope of its reconstruction on its former basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>They and their opponents merely differ about the practicability of restoring harmonious relations between the people of the dissevered sections, and of preserving in their integrity the old political connections between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>They have no sympathy with the motives which prompt the <rs>North</rs> to carry on this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>They have no feeling in common with the anti-slavery faction, and they have no disposition to enter upon a struggle for the maintenance of the commercial or political supremacy of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>They are only clinging desperately to hopes which every <num value="1">one</num> of their fellow citizens also cherished a little while ago but which a large proportion of the people of the <rs>State</rs> have been reluctantly compelled to </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> Nor is Congress in a condition to exercise its own pleasure with respect to the war. If Congress be the throne of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Republic, there is a power behind the throne greater than the throne itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>That power is the <rs>Executive</rs>, not so much by its own will and might, as by virtue of the military legions which it has called into existence, and of the will and sentiments of the popular masses, whose mouth-piece is the press and whose pleasure is the law, with both Congress and the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The cities of the <rs>North</rs> are keenly sensitive to all that affects the profits of trade; they are cosmopolitan, and comparatively conservative and tolerant of different opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But the masses of the people, who populate the rural districts, are less intelligent, more sectional, and more fanatical and truculent towards the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The politicians of the <rs>South</rs>, who had not been much at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, or watched the doings of Abolitionists there, and whose reading was confined to a single political newspaper of the respectable but obsolete stamp of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName>,</hi> participated in this view of the merchants, and repudiated the war as wildly chimerical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> A shrewed and observant gentleman of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, who has just returned from a Some what extended trip through the <rs>North</rs>, given its some interesting and reliable accounts of the state of affairs in that section.--When he left New York (on the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th inst.</day></dateStruct>) the war feeling had not abated a whit in bitterness, and the sentiment general among the masses was, that the <rs>South</rs> must be brought into submission to the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>, at whatever cost of men or money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>There was but little talk of politics, and the universal topic of conversation was the terrible condition of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The prostration of Northern commerce is complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The flow of money from the <rs>South</rs> has sensed.--The grain markets of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> are already glutted, and the <rs>West</rs>, cut off from the <rs>Southern</rs> market and unable to dispose of its immense surplus stocks of grain and provision, is, in turn, unable to buy goods in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Failures all over the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name> are multiplying to a frightful extent, and, dark as is the present, the future seems even more dismal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>It has come to be an admitted fact that the commercial crash will soon be universal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> The depreciation of <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> in New York is appalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Leading firms, which have heretofore paid many <num value="1000">thousands</num> annually as rent for their offices, now occupy the same buildings free of charge &mdash; the landlords being anxious to keep up appearances, and unable to retain their tenants upon any other terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>The state of affairs is even worse in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, where, in the most fashionable quarters, whole blocks of elegant residences are tenantless and go a begging at less than <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of the rents they readily drew a twelvemonth ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/> In the midst of the wide-spread ruin of the <rs>North</rs>'s commercial grandeur, the war spirit seems to gather new strength and ferocity.--At the bidding of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>, the starving sculpt of the great cities are enlisting by tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and are armed, equipped and dispatched to the border with surprising rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The material of these city battalions is the poorest that can be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Not so, however, with the regiments and brigades from the interior, which, in many instances, are composed of men who would do credit to any army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>The <orgName type="mil" key="RIRegiment">Rhode Island regiments</orgName>, particularly, are noticeable for their stalwart appearance, and for the excellence and completeness of their organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>The cause we know not. It created some excitement among the troops stationed at <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> Within the last few days, nearly all the sand-bags which caused so much apparent labor to mount, have been taken off the parapet of <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>The addition of this sand bag story probably rendered the fort too hot, as it cut off the breeze entirely, and hence its removal. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/> A spy was taken at the yard last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>He was on the beach signalling with a lantern to the opposite shore, which was answered.--What the signals meant can not be ascertained, as he obstinately refuses to give any account of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>He is now in irons, and awaits the fate of a spy, if such should be proved his true character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>So thought a young mother, while she gazed with a parent's pride on her little boy, as he stood before her in all the radiancy of infant beauty, his cheeks dyed with the joyous light of childhood. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> But, another picture was taken of mother's little darling; and oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>could she have raised the veil from it, as it hung, shrouded by the dark mists of the future, how her heart would have shrunk within her to have witnessed the change that had passed over the face of her boy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>There, in a tiny coffin, 'mid the folds of the scarlet dress, lay little <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>but the warm pulses of life had ceased to beat, and the roses had faded from the waxen face, while the long silken fringes had fallen softly over the blue eyes, hiding their joyous light forever; a few flowers were clasped within the little hands, while some were scattered around him, sweet emblems of the beautiful form that lay there so very still. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The shades of evening are falling softly around; the joyous songs of the sweet birds are hushed; they have folded their wearied wings and gone to rest; little <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>'s merry laugh is no longer heard; his feet have ceased to dance about the floor; he, too, has gone to sleep, and the happy mother softly murmurs a lullaby at the side of his couch. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Can it be that dark forebodings of evil are shading the light of her dreams?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>See, how her lips quiver, while she murmurs the name of her little son; now she clasps her hands wildly and springs from the bed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The eyes are half open and fixed; large drops have gathered on the brow, half shaded by the flaxen curls, while from the half compressed lips comes a smothered gurgling sound, then a mournful wail &mdash; the parting adieu of the mournful spirit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>The doctor arrives, but he shakes his head, and turns from the agonizing glance of the mother, as he exclaims <q>&#x0022;too late!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/> He has no hope to offer, for well does he know that the work of death is nearly finished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>The morning opened in splendor, shedding its golden light over the beautiful flowers, while their blossoms expanded beneath the warmth of its glorious rays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>The little birds awoke, and from the boughs of the trees filled the air with sweet melody; and the pet bird that lay trembling and convulsed in the arms of its mother, during the night, awoke from the sleep of death, and unfolding its little wings, sang <num value="1">one</num> of the songs of Paradise as it soared above to nestle on the breast of Jehovah. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>The mother sits all alone in her chamber &mdash; her heart is desolate; for the couch is empty by the side of her bed, and a vacant little chair stands in the corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Sad thoughts arise as she gazes mournfully on the picture before her, bearing the impress of the beauty reflected there only <num value="1">one</num> day previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>The features seem full of life in the mimic face, the bright eye, the glow of health, and the playful smile of innocence, vain delusions of mortality &mdash; all are there!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Then she turns to a little coffin that lies on a table near by, the lid is moved aside, and a waxen figure, bearing a true resemblance to the likeness in her hand, meets her eye; but a light beams over the face reflected not on the other; an angel, when he bore the spirit away, stamped with the seal of Heaven! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> Young mother!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>many a heart sympathizes with you to-day, and fervent are the pleadings that ascend to the throne on high, in your behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/> --A description of this gun has been published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>We notice some difference of opinion among <name>English</name> writers respecting its merits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>A writer in the <rs>New Monthly Magazine</rs> says that although it has caused a great sensation, it is now hardly spoken of. He claims also that it is too complicated for field practice, although he acknowledges that both <placeName reg="Whitworth, Franklin, Georgia" key="tgn,2024727">Whitworth</placeName>'s gun and <placeName reg="Whitworth, Franklin, Georgia" key="tgn,2024727">Whitworth</placeName>'s rifle make splendid practice in target shooting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>His objection to them in the field is that they are too <q>&#x0022;excellently fashioned&#x0022;</q> for the ordinary use of troops, and require great care lest they should get out of order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/> The rifle won the prize offered by the <rs>Queen</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for the best shots among volunteers, but it has not been adopted for the troops by the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>It is objected by this writer that with each round fired with the <name>Whitworth</name> gun, a diminution of range is perceptible, which he attributes to the augmented friction of the sharp-edged projectile.
