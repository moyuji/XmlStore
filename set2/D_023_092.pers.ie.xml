<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Her features were not very regular, and she was not very ill, but her eyes were so bright and color and her figure so elastic and <unclear></unclear>her abundant hair, and above all, her <unclear></unclear>they manners, and the expression of sunny good temper and perfect openness lighting up her face, made most people consider her a very attractive woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Forever <num value="1">one</num> in the parish liked her, from the <num value="2">two</num> old people, who eat near the above in church and always came round to get their dinner at the parsonage on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, to <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> <persName n="Rush,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Rush,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Rush</surname></persName>, who was by far the grandest lady in the parish. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Under these circumstances the lovers did not see much of each other, and they were finally married without Chrissy ever having suspected her <unclear> </unclear>of an affirmably of temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>She had suffered much on discovering that such was the cause, and felt inclined sometimes to wish <unclear></unclear>never been disenchanted; but she was a very also woman; she knew her husband's <unclear></unclear>excellences, and his strength as well as weakness and altering an old maxim to <unclear></unclear>her purpose, she resolved both to endure and to cure. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Chrissy started in alarm, but he recovered himself and said pettishly-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> <q>&#x0022;I do wish you would have that carpet nailed down.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> He turned into his study, shutting the door after him with unnecessary force, and <persName n="Ashton,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> returned to the fire and arranged her work basket for the day, with something of a cloud on her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>She sighed, but rose and entered the next room, where she found her husband standing before his bureau partly dressed, and with shirts, cravats and handkerchiefs scattered about him, like a new kind of snow, while his face bore an expression of melancholy reproach at once painful and ludicrous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> <q>&#x0022;What is the matter?&#x0022;</q> she asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> <q>&#x0022;O, the old story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>No button where it ought to bel Not a shirt ready to wear!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I am sure I would do more than that for you, but here I am delayed and put to the greatest inconvenience because you cannot sew on these buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> This address was delivered in a tone of </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> mournful distress which might have been justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>perhaps, if <persName n="Ashton,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> had picked his pocket of his sermon as he was going to church. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> <q>&#x0022;What is the matter with this shirt?&#x0022;</q> said Chrissy, quietly examining <num value="1">one</num> of the discarded paraments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/><q>&#x0022;It seems to have all the buttons in their places, and this <num value="1">one</num>, too, is quite perfect; and here is another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>My dear husband.how many shirts do you usually wear at a time&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> <q>&#x0022;Oh, it is very well for you to smile, my love, but I do assure you I found several with no means at all of fastening the wristbands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We had breakfasted late, and now I shall be detained half an hour, when I ought to be away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I know you mean well; but if you had served a year's apprenticeship to my mother before you were married, it might have been all the better for your housekeeping.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> <q>&#x0022;It might have prevented it all together,&#x0022;</q> thought Chrissy; but the thought was repressed in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>She picked up and replaced the scattered apparel, folded the snowy cravats, warmed her husband's overshoes, and saw that the beautiful little communion service, presented by a lady of the parish, and consecrated to such sufferers as <persName n="Carpenter,,Maggie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Carpenter,Maggie,,,"><foreName>Maggie</foreName> <surname>Carpenter</surname></persName>, was in readiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Before he left the house, <persName n="Ashton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> had forgotten both his fretfulness and its cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He kissed his wife, and thanked her for her trouble, and proposed that she should send for <persName n="Lilly,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Lilly,nomatch:0"><surname>Lilly</surname></persName> to spend the day with her, and strode away with his usual elasticity of step. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> Chrissy watched him from the door till he turned into the next street, and then went back to the fireside and to her own reflection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The fretfulness and tendency to be disturbed as little matters was almost her husband's only fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>He was self-sacrificing to the last degree faithful and indefatigable as an apostle, almost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>in his professional labors, liberal to a fault; and in his administration of parish matters, wise and conciliating to all. He could bear injuries, real injuries, with the greatest patience, and was never known to harbor resentment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> But with all these good qualities, <persName n="Ashton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> had <num value="1">one</num> fault &mdash; a fault which threatened to disturb and finally destroy the comfort of married life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>If his wife had, by extravagance or bad management, wasted his income and involved him in difficulties, it is probable that he would never have spoken an unkind word to her; but the fact of a button being missed or a book removed from its place, would produce a lamentation half indignant and half pathetic, which rung in Chrissy's ear's and made her heart ache long after <persName n="Clement,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Clement,Blokets,,,"><surname>Clement</surname></persName> had forgotten the circumstance altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Strange as it may seem, <persName n="Ashton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> never thought of this habit, of which indeed, he was but imperfectly conscious as to its being a fault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> He thought, indeed, that it was a pity he should be so sensitive, and sometimes said that he wished he had not such love of order and symmetry; for then he should be so often annoyed by the disorderly habits of other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He said to himself that it was <num value="1">one</num> of his peculiar trials that even Chrissy, perfect as she was, did not come up to his ideas in this respect; but that the temper with which he met what he was pleased to call his peculiar trials ever became a trial to other people, he did not imagine, He had indeed remarked, in spite of himself, that Chrissy's face was not as cheerful, nor her spirits as light, as when they were just married, and he regretted that the cares of housekeeping should wear so heavily upon her; but nothing was further from his thoughts <unclear></unclear>that anything in himself could have produced the change. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> <persName n="Ashton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName>, exhausted with his day's work, <unclear></unclear>toward home, with his mind and heart full at all he had seen and felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>He said very little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>during dinner; but when the table cloth was to moved, and he sat down in his dressinggown and slippers before the fire, he related to his wife all the events of the day, describing with all the enthusiasm of his earnest nature the patience and how resignation he had witnessed, and ended by saying: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> <q>&#x0022;Why, what do you mean, Chrissy?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> <q>&#x0022;Just what I <unclear></unclear>&#x0022;</q> returned Chrissy, with the same soberness <unclear></unclear>for instance; you can bear with the greatest resignation the loss of friends, and <unclear></unclear>I never saw you rattled by <unclear></unclear>from others, or show any impacts see there severe pain; but the loss of a <unclear></unclear>your shirt, or a nail from the carpet, <unclear></unclear>perfect right to be misreasonable, unkind, and I must say it--<unclear></unclear> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> <persName n="Ashton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> rose and walked up and down the room in some agitation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> <q>&#x0022;I did not think, my love,&#x0022;</q> he said at last, in a trembling ton, <q>&#x0022;that you would attach so much importance to a single hasty word.--Perhaps I spoke too quickly; but, even if it were so, did we not promise to be patient with each other's infirmities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>I am very glad to bear with&#x0022;</q>-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> <persName n="Ashton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> paused; he was an eminently truthful man, and, upon consideration, he could not remember that he had ever had anything to bear from his wife aside from the shirt buttons, etc., which he was now becoming conscious he had not borne very patiently. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> <q>&#x0022;If it were only once, my dear husband, I should say nothing about it; but you do not seem in the least aware how the habit has grown upon you. There has not been a day this week in which you have not made my heart ache by some such outburst of fretfulness.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> <persName n="Ashton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Ashton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ashton</surname></persName> was astonished; but as he began to reflect, he was still more surprised to find that his wife's accusations were quite true. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> <num value="1">One</num> day it had been about the front <rs n="door mat" type="product">door mat</rs>, the next about a mislaid Review, and then a lost pair of gloves, which, after all, were found in his own pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He felt that it was all true, and as his conscience brought forward <num value="1">one</num> instance of unkindness after another &mdash; real unkindness &mdash; he sat down again and covered his face with his hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> <q>&#x0022;But this is not the worst,&#x0022;</q> continued Chrissy, becoming agitated in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/><q>&#x0022;I fear &mdash; I cannot help fearing &mdash; that I shall be led to feel as I ought not toward you. I fear lest I shall in time lose the power of respecting my husband; and when respect goes, <persName n="Clement,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="nearbymention:Clement,Blokets,,,"><surname>Clement</surname></persName>, love does not last long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>This very morning I found myself wishing I had never known you.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> Chrissy burst into tears, an unusual demonstration for her, and <persName n="Clement,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="nearbymention:Clement,Blokets,,,"><surname>Clement</surname></persName>, springing up once more, traversed the room once or twice, and then sat down by his wife's side. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Christiana, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098482">Christiana</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> he said, mournfully, <q>&#x0022;I have deserved it; I feel that I have but to lose your respect to lose your love; my punishment is greater than I can bear, Chrissy.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> <q>&#x0022;It was but the thought of a moment,&#x0022;</q> replied Chrissy, checking her sobs; <q>&#x0022;but I am frightened that the idea should have entered my head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>If I should, I would rather die this moment.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid!&#x0022;</q> ejaculated her husband, as he clasped her in his arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/><q>&#x0022;But why, my dearest, have you never told me of this before?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> <q>&#x0022;It is neither a graceful nor a grateful office for a wife to reprove her husband, or a woman her pastor,&#x0022;</q> replied Carissy, laying her hand on his shoulder; &#x0022;and if I had not been left here all day, I think I should hardly have got my courage up now. But if you are not angry I am glad that I have told you all that was in my heart; for, indeed, my dear, it has been a sad, aching heart this long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>And now I must tell you how those <num value="2">two</num> unlucky shirts came to be buttonless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> <q>&#x0022;No, don't say <num value="1">one</num> word about them, my love,&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Clement,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="nearbymention:Clement,Blokets,,,"><surname>Clement</surname></persName>, impatiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/><q>&#x0022;I will never complain again, if the sleeves are missing as well as the buttons. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> <q>&#x0022;But I must tell you, because I really mean to have my housekeeping affairs in as good order as any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>I was looking over your shirts yesterday afternoon, and had put them all to rights but these <num value="2">two</num>, when <persName n="Lenox,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Lenox,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lenox</surname></persName> came in, in great distress, to say that her sister's child was much worse, and, they feared, dying; so I dropped all and went over there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>You know how it was. No <num value="1">one</num> had any calmness or presence of mind; the child's convulsions were frightful to witness; the mother was in hysterics, and <persName n="Lenox,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Lenox,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lenox</surname></persName> worse than nobody at all. It was nearly midnight before I could get away, and in the mean time <persName><foreName>Amy</foreName></persName> had put the room in order and restored the shirts to their places.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> Here <persName><foreName>Amy</foreName></persName> put her head into the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It was opened to her with a <unclear></unclear>kiss, and though there were not many words said on either side, there was a light in the eyes of the husband and wife which showed the understanding was perfect between then. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>
