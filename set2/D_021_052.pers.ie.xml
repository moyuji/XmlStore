<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Since the battle of <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName>, <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> has said that he did not commence the attack until <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men had been landed, and that there were <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> more in the ships to land if required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><num value="9">Nine</num> regiments of the land force were brought against the battery, behind which we had about <num value="400">four hundred</num> men; and it was not until they had fought near <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure>, and were flanked on either side, that they were forced to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Remaining entirely protected by the battery, and by the neighboring trees, it was seldom the volleys of the enemy took effect upon our soldiers, who only and whenever a fair mark presented itself <persName n="Wise,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Wise,Jennings,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> was continually talking to his men cautioning them against exposure, and directing them when it was safe to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It was while ordering his men to look out for a valley that he received the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The remainder of his wounds were given while being carried from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, however, was the mortal wound which laid the hero and noble patriot in the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He died the following day. When the enemy was seen approaching through the swamp on the right, it was evident that the battery could be held no longer, and immediate preparations were made to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Rallying his men around him <persName n="Anderson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Joseph,R.,,:3"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> retired about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>, to the reserve, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> companies, under <persName n="Wallace,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Wallace,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capts</roleName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName>, <persName n="Derman,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Derman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Derman</surname></persName>, <persName n="Morris,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Morris,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Morris</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Durham,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Durham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Durham</surname></persName> under <persName n="Blocker,Adjutant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Blocker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant">Adjutant</roleName> <surname>Blocker</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He at once gets the order to fall in, and they promptly rallied to protect the reserve, and stood firm until every man had passed by, some of them perfectly panic-stricken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <num value="60" type="ordinal">60th</num> fell in promptly, in an orderly manner, and marched immediately to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The reserve was ordered to form by companies, fire by companies, and protect the retreat until another sand could be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC31">31st North Carolina</orgName>, at once ran to their quarters, <persName n="Jordan,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Jordan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Jordan</surname></persName> riding at the head of the frightened procession, and there remained until summoned to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>His force consisted of <num value="8">eight</num> companies, making about <num value="500">five hundred</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He further asked <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,M.,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName> if he would rally to his assistance in case the pickets were attacked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Receiving an affirmative reply he advanced <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> and was met by the <num value="23" type="ordinal">23d</num>, <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="25MARegiment">25th Massachusetts regiments</orgName>, drawn up to receive him. The command for companies to fall into line, was instantly given, but just before ordering a fire, <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Federal Colonels</rs> shouted to him saying, <q>&#x0022;you are mistaken, don't shoot.&#x0022;</q> Suspecting the trick, he fired upon them for several minutes and repulsed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Seeing what a force he had to contend with the retreated in an orderly manner to the quarters of the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num>, and while rallying for another attack, a flag of truce passed by towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Col <persName n="Green,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Green,Stephen,,,:1"><surname>Green</surname></persName> at once rode over to <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,M.,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName> and asked if it was his command that he surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The reply was that the forces on the island had been already surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In the engagement, he lost <num value="5">five</num> men killed and <measure n="3" type="wounded">three wounded</measure>. The enemy had <measure n="17" type="killed">seventeen killed</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The <num value="59" type="ordinal">59th</num> marched directly by the quarters of <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,M.,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>, and halted at the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/><num value="1">One</num> of these gentlemen, speaking for the others, dilated on the causes which had induced the <rs>Southern States</rs> to secede from the <rs>Northern</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The principal of these causes, he said, was not slavery, but the very high price which, for the sake of protecting the <rs>Northern</rs> manufacturers, the <rs>South</rs> were obliged to pay for the manufactured goods which they required. --<num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of the <orgName n="Southern Congress" type="congress">Southern Congress</orgName> was to reduce these duties, and, to prove their sincerity, he gave as an instance that <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> had given up altogether that protection on her sugar which she enjoyed by the legislation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>That, however, when the question of recognition came to be formally discussed, there were <num value="2">two</num> points upon which inquiry must be made: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, whether the body seeking recognition could maintain its position as an independent State; secondly, in what manner it was proposed to maintain relations with foreign States. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> I said that it was alleged very currently that if the slave States found that they could not compete successfully with the cotton of other countries, they would revive the slave trade for the purpose of diminishing the cost of production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>They said this was a suspicion unsupported by any proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The fact was, that they had prohibited the slave trade, and did not mean to revive it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Every loan that has been put upon the market has been taken at and above par, and the undersigned but state the universal impression and belief of their Government and their fellow-citizens in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, that, no matter what may be the demand for means to defend their country against invasion, sufficient resources of every character, and sufficient patriotism to furnish them, exist within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> for that purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The undersigned are aware that an impression has prevailed, even in what may be termed well- informed circles in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, that the slaveholding States are poor, and not able to sustain a prolonged conflict with the non-slaveholding States of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The question of the morality of slavery it is not for the undersigned to discuss with any foreign Power.--The authors of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> found the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> race in the colonies to be slaves, both by colonial and <name>English</name> law, and by the law of nations.--Those great and good men left that fact and the responsibility for its existence where they found it; and thus finding that there were <num value="2">two</num> distinct reaches in the colonies, <num value="1">one</num> free and capable of maintaining their freedom, and the other slave and, in their opinion, unfitted to enter upon that contest and to govern themselves, they made their famous declaration of freedom for the white race alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>They eventually planned and put in operation, in the course of a few years, <num value="2">two</num> plans of government, both resting upon that great and recognized distinction between the white and the black man, and perpetuating that distinction as the fundamental law of the <rs>Government</rs> they framed, which they declared to be framed for the benefit of themselves and their posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>In their own language, <q>&#x0022;to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and <sic>ond</sic> our posterity.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The wisdom of that course is not a matter for discussion with foreign nations Suffice it to say that thus were the great <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> institutions framed, and thus have they remained unchanged to this day. It was from no fear that the slaves would be liberated that Secession took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The very party in power has proposed to guarantee slavery forever in the <name>States</name> if the <rs>South</rs> would but remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s message proposes no freedom to the slave but announces subjection of his owner to the will of the <rs>Union</rs>--in other words, to the will of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Even after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs> both branches of the <rs>Congress</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> passed resolutions that the war is only waged in order to uphold that (pro-slavery) Constitution, and to enforce the laws, (many of them pro-slavery;) and out of <num value="172">one hundred and seventy-two</num> votes in the lower <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName> they received all but <num value="2">two</num>, and in the <name>Senate</name> all but <num value="1">one</num> vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>As the army commenced its march, the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> issued an order that no slaves should be received into, or allowed to follow, the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The great object of the war, therefore, as now officially announced, is not to free the slave, but to keep him in subjection to his owner, and to control his labor through the legislative channels which the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> designs to force upon the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The undersigned, therefore, submit with confidence that as far as the anti-slavery sentiment of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is concerned, it can have no sympathy with the <rs>North</rs>; nay, it will probably become disgusted with a causing hypocrisy which would enlist those sympathies on false pretences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The undersigned are, however, not insensible to the surmise that the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> may, under stress of circumstances, change its policy &mdash; a policy based at present more upon a wily view of what is to be its effect in rearing up an element in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> favorable to the reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> than upon any honest desire to uphold a Constitution, the main provisions of which it has most shamelessly violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>But hey confidently submit to your lordship's consideration, that success in producing so abrupt and violent a destruction of a system of labor which has reared up so vast a commerce between- <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> and the great States of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, which, it is supposed, now gives bread to <num value="10000000">10,000,000</num> of the population of those States, which it may be safely assumed is intimately blended with the basis of the great manufacturing and navigating prosperity that distinguishes the age, and probably not the least of the elements of this prosperity, would be visited with results disastrous to the world, as well as to the master and slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Resort to servile war has, it is true, as we have heretofore stated, not been proclaimed, but officially abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>It has been, however, recommended by persons of influence in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and when all other means shall fail, as the undersigned assure your lordship they will, to bring the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> into subjection to the power of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Government, it is by no means improbable that it may be inaugurated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Whenever it shall be done, however, the motive, it is now rendered clear, will not be that high philanthropic consideration which undoubtedly beats in the hearts of many in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, but the base feeling of selfish aggrandizement, not unmixed with a cowardly spirit of revenge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The undersigned call your lordship's attention to what is now so publicly known as a fact &mdash; to the great <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> in front of <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, in which a well appointed army of <num value="55000">55,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Federal soldiers gave battle to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> army of inferior force, After <measure n="9hours" type="date">nine hours</measure> hard fighting the <name>Federalists</name> were defeated and driven from the field in open flight and were pursued by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> army to <placeName reg="Centerville, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098336">Centreville</placeName>, the position of the <rs>Federal</rs> reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The enemy lost honor, and nearly all the arms and munitions of war which had been so industriously gathered together for month for an offensive campaign in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and they did not cease their flight until, under cover of a stormy night, they had regained the shelter of their entrenchments in front of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> forces have commenced offensive movements, and have driven the vaunting hosts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> behind entrenchments upon the borders of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and so far from threatening the integrity of the territory and the existence of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> seems confident at present, and will be rejoined if it can maintain a successful defence of its capital, and preserve the remnant of its defeated and disorganized forces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The undersigned would also ask your lordship's attention to the fact that the cotton-picking season in the cotton-growing States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The crop bids fair to be at least an average <num value="1">one</num>, and will be prepared for market and delivered by our planters and merchants as usual, on the wharves of the ports of those States, when there shall be a prospect of the blockade being raised, and not before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>As a defensive measure, an embargo has been laid by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> upon the passage of cotton by inland conveyance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They submit to your lordship the consideration of the fact that the blockade of all the points of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was declared to have commenced by the blockading officer off <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, when, in truth, at that time, and for weeks after, there was no pretence of a blockade of the ports in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>They submit for consideration that since the established or the blockade there have been repeated instances of vessels breaking it at </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It will be for the neutral Powers, whose commerce, has been so seriously damaged, to determine how long such a blockade shall be permitted to interfere with their commerce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> In closing this communication, the undersigned desire to urge upon her Britannic Majesty's Government the just claim which, in their opinion the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has at this time to a recognition as a Government <hi rend="italics">de facto;</hi> whether its internal peace or its territory, its population, its great resources for both domestic and foreign commerce, and its power to maintain itself, are considered; or whether your lordship shall take into consideration the necessity of commercial relations being established with it, with a view to the preservation of vast interests of the commerce of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>If, however, in the opinion of her Britannic Majesty's Government, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have not yet won a right to a place among the nations of the earth, the undersigned can only, assure your lordship that, while such an announcement will be received with surprise by the <rs>Government</rs> they represent, and while that Government is to be left to contend for interests which, it thinks, are as important to commercial <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as to itself, without even a friendly countenance from other nations, its citizens will buckle themselves to the great task before them with a vigor and determination that will justify the undersigned in having pressed the question upon her Britannic Majesty's Government; and when peace shall have been made their Government will at least feel that it will not be justly responsible for the vast quantity of blood which shall have been shed, nor for the great and wide-spread suffering which so prolonged a conflict will have entailed upon <num value="1000000">millions</num> of the human race, both in the <rs>Eastern</rs> as well as upon the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The fact was he very seldom read the reports either of his own speeches or of other speeches which he heard in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> An article in the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Daily News" type="newspaper">Daily News</orgName>,</hi> reviewing the rights and duties of belligerents and neutrals, has recently come under my observation, in which the following expressions occur: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> <q>&#x0022;At the same time, it must be admitted that both the <rs>Sumter</rs> and the <rs>Nashville</rs> have grossly violated the laws of civilized warfare, by burning merchant ships to the water's edge, instead of carrying them before a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Their conduct is certainly much more like that of pirates--<hi rend="italics">hosies humans generis,</hi> as the commander of the <rs>Sumter</rs> says.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Nor is it clear that a community which sanctions such barbarous proceedings deserves to be treated with the same consideration which is universally accorded to those who themselves observe the laws of civilized warfare,&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> Now, the above remarks are exceedingly unjust &mdash; not that I suppose you intended injustice, but you have not rightly appreciated the position in which we of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have been placed by these <q>&#x0022;civilized&#x0022;</q> nations whose rule of warfare you say has been violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has acknowledged us as a belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>This acknowledgement gives us all the rights of war equally with the other party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most essential of these rights on the high seas as the right of destroying the enemy's commerce, and thus disabling him from carrying on the war; a right which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in all her wars, has exercised to its fullest extent, and with terrible effect upon her enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>And when she has not found it convenient to send her prizes into her own ports she has had that overweening influence with the nations of the earth which has enabled her to send them into neutral ports, and there, to have them condemned by her own prize courts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> The ports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were blockaded on or about the <date value="1861-06-01">1st of June, 1861.</date> Subsequently to this period, and with full knowledge of the fact, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and the lesser maritime Powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, all issued proclamations, defining their positions in the war. In these proclamations they prohibited belligerent cruisers from bringing their prizes into their ports &mdash; except in case of necessity and in that event both the cruisers and their prizes were to do part within <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. In this state of facts, how can it be insisted that we shall send our prizes into port for adjudication?--Into whose ports shall we send them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>We cannot send them into our own ports, for they are blockaded at least so far blockaded as to render it difficult for ordinary sail ships to enter them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>We cannot send them into any of the ports of those <q> &#x0022;civilized&#x0022;</q> nations who are so shocked at the barbarity of our burning them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>What then shall we do with them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>They are our lawful prizes, captured, says <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, by the cruisers of a recognized <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Shall we let them go?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>This would deprive us of our right of capture, or render null that right, which is the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>And can this be what impartial <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> intended when it penned its proclamations? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> It is readily admitted that the usual and more proper course is, as you say, for a cruiser not to <q>&#x0022;burn her prizes to the water's edge,&#x0022;</q> but to send them into a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize court</orgName> for adjudication&#x0022; and this is the course which I need not assure you we would be glad to pursue if the thing were possible for obvious reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>But if the nations of the earth put it out of our power to pursue this course, is it generous to find fault with us because we do not pursue it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>To show you the earnests desire which I had in the beginning of my cruiser to send my prizes in for adjudication rather than take the responsibility of sitting in judgment on them myself I send you enclosed a copy of a letter which I addressed to the <rs>Governor</rs> of the town of <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>, in the <rs type="place">Island of Cuba</rs>, as early as the <date value="07-06">6th of July</date> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> In the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th inst.</day></dateStruct> the <rs>Earl</rs> of <placeName reg="Caernarfon, Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire, Wales" key="tgn,7008824">Carnarvon</placeName> was anxious to ascertain the truth, or rather to obtain from <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government a contradiction of a story which had been in circulation during the last week or <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>. That story seemed to him so monstrous in the shape in which it had reached this country, that he was almost confident it must be full of exaggeration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It was to the effect that a Canadian gentleman, a British subject, whilst traveling on an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> railway, was arrested by order of <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; that he was taken to the guard-house, stripped and searched, and subjected to very great and gross indignity, under the pretence that he was connected with some persons engaged in the war in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Nothing was found to inculpate him in the slightest degree, but he was but he was taken to prison in New York, where he was immured for several weeks, while typhus fever was raging in the prison, and carrying off its victims daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>He was detained without being brought to trial, and without, in fact, a charge being made against him. Communications were opened by him with <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> though the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, but without his obtaining any redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>During that time he received several letters from the <rs>British Legation</rs>, but the seals were broken and the covers torn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The most extraordinary part of the matter, however, was that at length, when he was offered his liberty, it was on the condition that he should for swear his own nationality and swear allegiance to the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>He (<rs type="role" reg="Earl">Earl</rs> of <placeName reg="Caernarfon, Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire, Wales" key="tgn,7008824">Carnarvon</placeName>) could hardly believe that such a state of things was possible; but this was the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It was said that this gentleman with very great courage and constancy refused to accept any such condition, and preferred, at the risk of his life and of great personal suffering and inconvenience, to remain on prison rather than accept a discharge on such terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>He was after wards removed to another prison, and it was said that, after that time, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> having interposed, he was offered his liberty on a condition only <num value="1">one</num> degree less extraordinary than the former <num value="1">one</num>, namely, that he would not engage in the service of the <rs>Southern States</rs> nor have they communication with the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>He refused that condition and he remained to prison from the <date value="10-05">5th of October</date> until the <date value="01-06">6th of January,</date> when he received an unconditional discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It was also stated their other <name>British</name> subjects had been confined in the same prison, and subject to various restrictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>They had been treated in violation of international rights and privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He would not make any comments on the subject, because he could not bring himself to believe that the facts were as they had been stated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, who was very indistinctly heard, was understood to say that on the <date value="10-29">29th of October,</date> a letter was written to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> by <persName n="Shepherd,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Shepherd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <surname>Shepherd</surname></persName>, saying that while traveling by railway &mdash; he had been an agent of the <orgName n="Grand Trunk Railroad" type="railroad">Grand Trunk Railway</orgName>--he was arrested and sent to a prison in New York, on a charge of conspiracy against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>That gentleman further stated the charge was quite untrue, and that he was a loyal <name>British</name> subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It further appeared that he was asked to take the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and refused to do so. <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> sent a representation to <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, and on the <date value="11-15">15th of November</date> he wrote a reply, saying that he had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been led to believe that the gentleman was a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and that it was under such an impression he had asked him to take the oath of allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>But when it turned out that he was a British subject is release was still with held on the ground that he was a spy in the employ of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. <persName n="Shepherd,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Shepherd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Shepherd</surname></persName> gave an indignant denial to that accusation, and he was then asked to enter into certain conditions <num value="1">one</num> of which was, that he was not to enter the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> during the war. Subsequently he was liberated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs> would understand that <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> assumed the right of the <rs>President</rs> to order the arrest of any person during the war at his pleasure, whether a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> or not, and the law officers of his Government contended that such a power attached to the <rs>President</rs> under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <name>States</name>.--He had no objection to produce the correspondence upon the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The <rs>Earl</rs> of <placeName reg="Caernarfon, Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire, Wales" key="tgn,7008824">Carnarvon</placeName> was sorry to hear that the facts of the case as he had stated them, and which he could scarcely bring himself to believe, were borne out by the statement of the noble lord, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> for Foreign Affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It seemed to him strange and monstrous that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>U. States</rs> should, on such a pretence, have violated the ordinary decencies which regulated the intercourse between friendly nations &mdash; He should move for the correspondence, because he thought the <rs type="place">House</rs> ought to understand the matter in all its hearings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He hoped it would be found that when remonstrating against the proceedings of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> government the noble lord had not forgotten to ask for compensation for the outrage. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>(Hear, hear.) It was not his intention to enter in detail upon the question on that occasion, but there was <num value="1">one</num> point connected with the war which he was justified in alluding to, and that was the condition of the blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>(Hear, hear) He did so because, last year, on the <date value="05-06">6th of May,</date> he put <num value="3">three</num> questions to the <rs>Foreign Secretary</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of which referred to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He then asked <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> whether his Government had informed the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that their blockade, if not effective, would not be recognized; to which <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> replied that he had not thought it necessary to give any special instruction to our Minister at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, but that <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> and the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> both knew that no blockade could be recognized unless it was effective.--Now, documents had been placed in his (<persName n="Gregory,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Gregory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gregory</surname></persName>'s) hands within the last few days, which showed considerable doubt to exist with reference to the effectiveness of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>He regretted to be obliged to express his conviction that the blockade was only a paper blockade, but he should not then anticipate the discussion which must take place on the production of the papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>He has merely risen that evening to announce his intention of bringing the whole question of the blockade before the <rs type="place">House</rs>, because if the figure which he should be prepared to quote should turn out to be true then he thought the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> would pronounce the blockade to be ineffective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>On the other hand, it would rest with the <rs>Government</rs> to pronounce whether it was effective or not. Whilst they looked at all these matters from a conciliatory point of view as regarded the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, although he should be the last man to advocate any act of hostility, still, as this country had acknowledged <num value="2">two</num> belligerent parties, he though that in justice to both, and to the suffering people of this country no time should be lost in discussing the subject--(hear, hear)--and ascertaining whether this blockade was in reality effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> questions involved in the consideration of the subject &mdash; namely, its commercial bearing and its bearing upon the character of this country.--Upon the commercial question he would at present say nothing; but it appeared to him perfectly clear that if his honorable friend (<persName n="Gregory,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="mostcommon:Gregory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gregory</surname></persName>) was able to substantiate the statement he had foreshadowed &mdash; namely, that the blockade had been nothing more than a paper blockade &mdash; then the character of this country was to a great extent involved in its recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The recognition of a paper blockade would, as was admitted on all hands, be a violation of the rise of international law; and, assuming that such could be shown to be the character of the blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, he should like to know what become of the principle of non-intervention of which they had heard so much; for, if the blockade was not efficient, its recognition would be an intervention in favor of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

The measure will be hailed with satisfaction by our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It might have been taken months since with advantage to our cause, and certainly very much to the comfort and security of our citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> While the demoralizing effects of dissipation in the metropolis were highly injurious to the army, and required this rigorous measure for its suppression, there was yet another graver and weightier reason for its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The free and unrestricted access of Federal spies to this city, and if not to the most reserved places, at least to the outer halls of every department of the <rs>Government</rs>, exposed every act of the <rs>Executive</rs>, every movement of our troops, and every fact relating to our means and plans to the knowledge of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>To ferret out these lurking foes and to prevent the prosecution of their operations here in future, was a matter of vital importance, and the exertion of a strict military surveillance necessary for that object. --There was yet another reason for it, and that it appears, was the existence of some hostility in this city &mdash; among persons residing here &mdash; to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. --To what extent this hostility has been entertained, and how it was proposed to make it effective, we are entirely ignorant.--We had of course, never believed that all who voted for the ordinance of secession were sincerely for it, but we had supposed they would at least do nothing against the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and that they would continue quiet citizens, yielding to the will of the almost unanimous voice of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>But recent developments, it is now understood, had proved that there were a number of malcontents who seized the moment of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reverse to plot treason and fan the embers of disaffection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>We cannot believe that they are more than a few; but the measure just reported to by the <rs>President</rs> was essential to put a check upon their underground workings. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>In this, as in other things, the <rs>British Government</rs> has kept within the line of neutrality between the belligerent powers marked out by itself at the beginning of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But, in acknowledging the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as a belligerent power it committed what the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> secretly considers a breach of neutrality, which it would have resented at once if it had dared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>In every subsequent act based upon this assumption, it has gone far enough to offend the <rs>U. States</rs>, without going far enough to preserve its interest from the ultimate consequences of that offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It adopted in the beginning the theory of States rights, in opposition to the consolidation theory of the <rs>Washington</rs> government, and, taking that ground, there was no logical result but quasi antagonism to the <rs>Federal</rs> power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>But it has feared to strike a blow the very audacity of which would have been the greatest discretion, and which, in its results, would have elevated <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to a pitch of power and prosperity beyond the reach of rivalry from any nation under the sun. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>There is no future event of which we feel more certain, in the event of the triumph of the <rs>North</rs>, than its determination to have vengeance upon <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for the humiliations which it conceives that power has inflicted upon it in the present war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>The extensive and mischievous rumors which for some days have been busily circulated for the especial benefit of timid men and alarmists, caused this statement to be received with distrust; but when it was proven true beyond the possibility of a doubt the news was hulled with general pleasure.
