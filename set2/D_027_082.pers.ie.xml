<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Military operations yesterday on the north side of <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName>, below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, possessed but little interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>At intervals during the morning the report of a distant cannon was heard, which doubtless proceeded from the fleet shelling some position occupied by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Persons from the front informed us that everything was comparatively quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> still hold possession of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, and are said to be strengthening the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is also reported that they are fortifying on the place known as &#x0022;Enterprise,&#x0022; formerly owned by <persName n="Atlee,,Jacob,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Atlee,Jacob,S.,,"><foreName>Jacob</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Atlee</surname></persName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,2275605" n="1.000 10" reg="Darbytown, Wayne, Pennsylvania">Darbytown</placeName> road, <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>While this lacks official confirmation, the intelligence comes to us in such a manner as to leave little doubt of its truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The rumor that the enemy were re-crossing to the south side of the <rs>James</rs> was reiterated yesterday; but the <orgName n="Petersburg Express" type="newspaper">Petersburg <hi rend="italics">Express</hi></orgName> has information, received on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, that a train of artillery had re-crossed on the pontoons, and it was not believed that any infantry had gone over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The conduct of the enemy in <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName> has been marked by some peculiarities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>While some citizens have been heavy losers by their presence, others state that they have not been annoyed, but that, on the contrary, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> exhibited a disposition to purchase and pay for such provisions as they needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This, however, will be but temporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are permitted to remain in the county for any length of time, they will doubtless display their plundering propensities to the fullest extent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The report that <persName n="Pleasants,,George,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Pleasants,George,D.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Pleasants</surname></persName>, sheriff of <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName>, has been captured by the enemy is incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They visited his place twice, but he effected his escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There is no confirmation of the report that a considerable force of the enemy is advancing up the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>From <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The operations in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> for the past few days have been quite active, and we give a brief <hi rend="italics">resume</hi> of them for the information of our readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Having thrown a large body of troops to the north side of the <rs>James</rs>, and gained some advantage there, a division of the enemy's cavalry was moved, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, across the <placeName reg="Vaughan, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120310">Vaughan</placeName> road to feel our position and strength, and, if possible, to establish themselves in that locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Their effort signally failed, thanks to the energy and good behavior of our cavalry, who repulsed the enemy and re-established their lines, which had been temporarily broken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, however, a more serious and successful movement was executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>An entire corps of infantry, with a considerable force of artillery, fell upon our works on <placeName reg="William Peebles's farm">William Peebles's farm</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="Squirrel Level">Squirrel Level</placeName> road, a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> west of the enemy's original lines, and by force of numbers succeeded, after a sharp engagement, in dislodging our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><placeName key="tgn,2335395" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort McRee, Escambia, Florida">Fort McRae</placeName>, and a portion of the line of breastworks adjacent, fell into their hands, with <num value="1">one</num> piece of artillery and a few prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Flushed with their success, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> soon advanced again, in the direction of the <rs>Boydton</rs> plankroad, and swarmed over <placeName reg="Bossieux's farm">Bossieux's</placeName>, <placeName reg="Boswell's farm">Boswell's</placeName>, <placeName reg="Pegram's farm">Pegram's</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jones's farm">Jones's farms</placeName>, but were struck on the latter by our forces, and checked in their onward movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Battle was here joined, and the enemy forced back in the direction of the captured works, with severe loss in killed, wounded and prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The engagement began late in the afternoon and was closed by the darkness of night, with the enemy still in possession of the captured works on <placeName><persName n="Peebles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Peebles,nomatch:0"><surname>Peebles</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName> and a portion of their column slightly in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The enemy's dead and wounded fell into our hands, with a large number of prisoners, estimated as high as <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, operations were early resumed on our right, and the enemy's advance driven back by our infantry, who, during a charge, captured about <measure n="250" type="prisoners">two hundred and fifty prisoners</measure>, and an assault was made on the fortified position on <placeName><persName n="Peebles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Peebles,nomatch:0"><surname>Peebles</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, which was, unfortunately, not successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The enemy, during the night, had received strong reinforcements, and had considerably strengthened their works.--Our loss in this affair was trifling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> At a later period in the day, <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> succeeded in gaining a point on the left flank of the enemy, some <num value="7">seven</num> or <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>, which, being discovered, a portion of his command was attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Our men were somewhat hotly pressed and compelled to retire slowly; but reinforcements coming up, they again advanced, and in turn drove the enemy to their works, capturing <measure n="200" type="prisoners">two hundred prisoners</measure> and otherwise inflicting heavy loss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Among our casualties, not before mentioned, are the following: <persName n="Bookter,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Bookter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bookter</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, killed; <persName n="McCrary,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:McCrary,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>McCrary</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, slightly wounded; <persName n="Barbour,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Barbour,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Barbour</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, slightly wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> <persName n="Fontaine,Doctor,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Fontaine,John,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Fontaine</surname></persName>, whose death we announced yesterday, was <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>'s medical director. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Saturday closed with the enemy in possession of our lost works, but no further advance, and our troops in good spirits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The body of <persName n="Cummings,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Cummings,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Cummings</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, was found on the field of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>'s fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The prisoners captured represented the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 5">Fifth</orgName> and <orgName type="corps" n="corps 9">Ninth corps</orgName>, showing that the enemy was in strong force on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Many were drunk when brought into <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and behaved in an impudent and disorderly manner. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> We frequently meet with agreeable pictures of the hopeless isolation and ruin which will be brought upon <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> by the eventual separation of the <rs>Northwestern</rs> and Middle States from the <name>Land</name> of the <name>Pilgrims</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> We wish we could share these pleasing anticipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>But, in the first place, the wicked rarely receive their deserts in this world; and, in the second place, we have grave doubts of the capacity of the <rs>Western</rs> and Middle States to reduce <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> to that state of solitary punishment which would prove so beneficial to the rest of the world.--The lock has not been invented that a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cannot pick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Try it, by all means; but if you shut him out at the door, he will come in by the window, or clamber, like an enterprising grimalkin, upon the roof and come down through the chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> It would be pleasant to get rid of this elastic and pervading nuisance, but we might as well expect to be free from mosquitoes and fevers in swamps as of New Englanders where anything is to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The Middle States and the <rs>West</rs> shut out <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> !

The more they execrated them, the more the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> delighted in them, beguiled them with resplendent tinware, made love to their daughters and sisters, and became their sons-in-law and their brothers-in-law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>As soon as they are fledged, they fly away to seek their fortunes elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>How will the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name> keep the people out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Nothing but sword and fire have kept them out of our own borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>This is the sweet simplicity of dotage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Did he suppose that the <name>Sons</name> of the <name>Pilgrims</name> were going to bear the burthens, and leave other people the profits, of a war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>We can easily imagine the indignant scorn with which it will be received by every true <orgName n="New Englander" type="newspaper">New Englander</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It is the vocation of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> to be &#x0027;smart,&#x0027; and he who questions her smartness stabs her character to the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It is not smart to go and be killed for the purpose of putting money into other men's pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald's</hi> complaint is as unmanly as it is senseless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>If the giant permits the dwarf to become his master, the presumption is that the dwarf has the most brains, and is entitled to the ascendancy.--A horse is a more powerful animal than a man, but the man rides him for the same reason that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> rides the <rs>Middle States</rs> and the <rs>West</rs>. --These latter are a money-making and farming people, Well enough at their counters and plough tails, but not overstocked with genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Moreover, if, as they say, their population is so much larger than that of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, it is obvious that they ought not to look to her for fighting men. She furnishes them with ideas and machinery; but her human stock is small, and she is compelled to be economical in its expenditure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>What would become of the world if the race of the <name>Pilgrims</name> should become extinct; if the seed-corn of the civilization, religion and progress of the world should be exhausted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> And this enterprising and exemplary people they propose to shut out in the cold ! Do they not fear that the same smartness which has proved too much for the stupid, vicious masses of the <rs>Middle States</rs> will contrive to make a lodgment among them under any and all circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Do they imagine that the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> cat will not always alight on his feet?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>We have no sympathy with their tribulations, Execrating the New Englanders as they profess to do, and having the power to crush the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> spirit, they have permitted themselves to become the willing tools of a minority, contemptible in numbers, but fiend like in malice and wickedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>They have become possessed of devils, and now, when they find themselves, like swine, rushing headlong into the sea, they are eager to get rid of the motive power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>If the devils had led them into green pastures and smooth rivers, they would have considered them demigods, and grunted out thanksgivings. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Its books, its newspapers, its pedlars, its wooden nutmegs and cake hams, its political and religious humbuggery of every kind, have been confined to Northern victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>If it has made them bleed at every pore, they have deserved it, and we are glad of it. It has not fingered much of our great staples, and will not while the war lasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The only fear we have of its intrusion will come with peace.
