<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The title of the bill is. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> A bill to collect direct taxes in insurrectionary districts, and for other purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It provides, as we learn from the <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName>, for the appointment of a Board of Tax Commissioners, who shall enter upon their duties whenever and wherever the <rs>Federal</rs> military authority shall be established.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> We are given further to understand that the preemption principle is also engrafted on the bill with the view of holding out additional inducements to the invasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> This bill sweeps all the property of every man who is fighting for his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It takes it from him, and he can only recover it by proving that be has not aided the <q> &#x0022;Rebellion&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;in any manner.&#x0022;</q> Its most diabolical feature, however, is the provision which requires it to be sold only to <q>&#x0022;loyal citizens,&#x0022;</q> or those mercenary foreigners whose status is described as <q>&#x0022;any person who shall have faithfully served in the army, navy, or marine corps;&#x0022;</q> and in order to invest this clause with as much popularity as possible with that large mass of the <rs>Northern</rs> hordes which are now penetrating our country, it is provided that the lands may be <q> &#x0022;subdivided&#x0022;</q>--cut up into small farms, to meet the wants, and be covered by the means of <q>&#x0022;any person.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>This bill prescribes some of the modes by which it is to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The same body which passed it have under consideration other <hi rend="italics">revenues measures, </hi> in which it is intended to tax <hi rend="italics">slaves</hi> and cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Yes, strange as it may seem, <q>&#x0022;slaves&#x0022;</q> as well as cotton, for, although they are robbing us of our servants as fast as they can, they are unwilling to permit what are left to escape <hi rend="italics">taxation!</hi> The religious obligation they always feel to raise revenue &mdash; to supply the <unclear>fisc,</unclear> private and public &mdash; will not allow them to pass over anything, and that higher <hi rend="italics">religious obligation they <unclear></unclear> to themselves</hi> compels them to make the public burthens light on themselves and as heavy as possible on other people.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> This bill is a plain avowal of the design of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, in the event it gets the power over the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It is, indeed, only a foretaste of what that Government will do by yet more sweeping and summary measures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government has not yet gotten the world in a sling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It may venture upon its measures in its military districts, but its army may have to evacuate them as they have done the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Nothing short of a complete overrunning and holding of the country can give the <name>Federalists</name> security in their proceedings, nay, and not even that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Then will be the trouble of ejecting a whole people froth their homes and putting in their places a new population of all sorts of men, inclining <q>&#x0022;any person&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;every body,&#x0022; </q> for whom the present estates must be <q>&#x0022;subdivided.&#x0022;</q> When this is attempted, difficulties never dreamed of will present themselves to the ingenious <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>He will indeed have contrived in a great degree our own ruin, but he cannot carry out his measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Nor will he escape altogether that rain which he brings upon us. Since he has thriven solely on Southern commerce and industry, when be has destroyed them he can thrive no more as be has done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> But despite any of those obstacles which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> will certainly encounter, the people of the <rs>South</rs> may rest assured that it gets the power, it will as far as it can, visit upon them the entire burthens of this war. The only way to prevent it is to fight to the death, and never desponding or relaxing our resistance, finally to triumph and rivet upon that Government and people that infamy and shame in the eyes of the world which will follow defeat in their ruthless crusade of robbery and plunder under the disguise of patriotism and philanthropy. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It is the discussions of such bills in Congress, and the foolish proclamations of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, that have revived the sinking cause of the rebels and brought them back to the vicinity of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The whole course of Congress since the opening of the session has been worth more than <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men to the insurgent leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Bacfor the proceedings of the abolitionists in Congress and out of it, the rebellion would have long since died a natural death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Their business appears to be to heap fresh fuel on the expiring flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The best recruiting sergeants of the rebels are the abolition demagogues in the halls of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>A short time ago <persName n="Wilson,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Senator,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> proposed to top enlistment and reduce the army by <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men.

Bad it not bean for the disloyal course of the abolitionists in playing into the hands of the rebels, <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men would have sufficed to restore the <rs>Union</rs> and peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>If they continue in their present course, and are not put down by an indignant people, he must be a very far- seeing and profound philosopher who can predict the end of the war, or measure the disastrous consequences to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic and the human rare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> Only <num value="2">two</num> things were necessary to be done--<num value="1">one</num> was to whip the rebels in the field, and the other was to supply our army with the a news of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>But if the fanatics and fools in Congress are very reluctant to fight, they have at least the power of supplying with money a patriotic army ready and willing to pour out its blood like water for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Here again Congress is at fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It will not pass the <name>Tax</name> bill, so essential to the financial credit of the country and the ultimate success of our arms; while it wastes its time in discussing and passing foolish bills for confiscating the property of rebels of which we have not possession, which is about equal in wisdom to the project of emancipating the slaves before we are in occupation of the territory where the slaves are to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The proverb of counting the chickens before they are hatched is prudence, compared with the action of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It is not only reckoning without its host, but doing its worst to defeat the calculations of our generals and their armies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> Let the rebels be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> subdued, and the authority of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> established in the insurgent States, and then the question of preventing a recurrence of rebellion is in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Most certainly to hold out before hand a sweeping measure of confiscation, making no distinction between leaders and their deluded followers, is not the way to put down the rebellion, for there is no inducement left to the rebels to yield; on the contrary, every temptation is offered to them to resist to the last, and this, no doubt, is the secret of the bill now passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The design is to prevent the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>But the spirit of the people is suddenly aroused by recent events.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> The public has already been made familiar with the fact that previous to leaving <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> the rebels planted torpedoes and other explosive articles in the tents, paths, &#x0026;c., which our officers would be most likely to frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Several lives of Union men were lost in this way. It was stated, in an <unclear></unclear> made by a rebel prisoner named <persName n="Grover,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00693" reg="mostcommon:Grover,nomatch:0"><surname>Grover</surname></persName>, that these murderous weapons were prepared and distributed under the immediate personal supervision of <persName n="Rains,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00694" reg="mostcommon:Rains,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, who took great interest in the manufacture and in designating the spots where they were to be planted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/> When this plot for assassination had been discovered, it was naturally supposed that the rebel magazines had also been prepared for an explosion upon being opened by Union men; and it was therefore determined that they should be opened, and the torpedoes taken up wherever found, by the rebel prisoners in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>When this determination was announced to the prisoners by <persName n="Allen,General,,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00695" reg="nearbymention:Allen,R.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Military-Governor">Military Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, they remonstrated against it, and their officers drew up a formal protest against it, as in violation of the usages of war. They intimated, though they did not assert, the right of a retreating army to resort to any measures which would retard pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>But they claimed that, as they had personally taken no part in planting these torpedoes, or in preparing the magazines for explosion, and were in no way responsible for it, they ought not to be exposed to the special dangers supposed to be connected with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Tents, baggage, stores, &#x0026;c., had all disappeared, and the foe found naught but a deserted scene, wildly adorned with desolation and waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Early in the morning the enemy threw out strong pickets towards our front, had cannon pointing on the road, yet betook themselves to burying their dead, scattered far and wide in all directions; and although heavy details were made for the purpose, the work had not ceased late in the afternoon of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>What their intentions or designs may be, are shaded in mystery &mdash; no movement along betrays the secret; their &#x00E6;ronauts frequently ascend for observations, but their glasses we know could never discover or divine our movements below, and conscious of our <rs type="role2">General</rs>'s anxiety to silently and unobserved prosecute their plans, we do not desire even to whisper what we imagine to be their intentions, but leave them to time and circumstance for mature development and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Firing of desultory character was going on all day yesterday, and towards evening heavy guns were heard towards the river. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/> An ominous silence prevailed along the entire front yesterday, and, compared with the bustle, excitement, and endless traffic of the day before, was remarkable in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>On Sunday an endless string of pleasure-seekers and sight-seers thronged the road, some few bent, perhaps on errands of mercy or charity, but the majority actuated from sole motives of idle, vitiated and vulgar curiosity, prompted solely by hopes of petty plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Hundreds, indeed, who shunned the field in hours of strife, with an enemy thundering at the gates, frantically rushed to the deserted camps and brought off heavy loads of indescribable, including ammunition and costly arms, unknowingly, perhaps, depriving a worthy arm of fitting implements of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Many muskets, &#x0026;c., were taken from these relic-mongers by sentinels on the outskirts of town, and some were ludicrously astonished when compelled to surrender them to proper keepers, thinking, perhaps, the <rs>Government</rs> was unusually tyrannical in allowing none to posses captured arms except those actually engaged to use them. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> The march continued till <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, when we slept on our arms, about a mile from <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124364">Greenbrier river</placeName> bridge, where the enemy's pickets were stationed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>We then opened a sharp cannonade upon the enemy in the town, in which crowds of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were stationed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>Had we continued to hold this position, using the artillery and keeping the infantry as a reserve, there is hardly a doubt but that the day would have been ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>But in an evil hour we were ordered to cease firing and charge the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>As our brave men rushed down into the town, <unclear></unclear> to the command, they encountered a most galling fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>Sheltered in the houses behind fences, from every direction the enemy literally mowed down our men; still the brave <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>, led on by the fearless <persName n="Banbee,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00940" reg="mostcommon:Banbee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Banbee</surname></persName>, pushed on, driving the enemy before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>In a few moments more the aspect of the battle was entirely changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Our men were in a valley while the enemy were forming their column as along the brave of a hill just above us. There was an almost entire cessation of firing for <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>, while our men steadily advanced up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>A large portion of the enemy's force was held in ambush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>and our men were within shot-gun range of the enemy's front, when suddenly a sheet of <num value="5">five</num> steamed from the woods, and a murderous fire was rained upon <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Finney,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00941" reg="mostcommon:Finney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Finney</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Most of these men had never bean under fire before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>At each discharge from the enemy's guns they fell by scores; they stood till nearly every other man lay dead or wounded, when they broke and retreated in the greatest disorder. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>A perfect panic now <unclear> sned</unclear> Save some few brave spirits, who would not leave the field, everybody seemed to be exerting their utmost power to get before every <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>I am proud to say that the artillerymen stood by their guns till the enemy were not more than <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards distant</measure>, when they were ordered to leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>It is hardly just to call men cowards who were posted in such perfect slaughter pens; and no <num value="1">one</num> can doubt for a moment the bravery of <persName n="Hath,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00946" reg="mostcommon:Hath,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hath</surname></persName>. <num value="1">One</num> fact is certain, we under estimated the force of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>We left on the field in dead, wounded, and misting, at least <num value="400">four hundred</num> men. The enemy's loss was heavy, but much less than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/><persName n="Finney,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00947" reg="mostcommon:Finney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Finney</surname></persName>, though he could have retreated, refused to turn his back upon the enemy, and was captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Perhaps in no battle of the war, of equal duration, was there more terrible fighting or greater carnage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It was all over before <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time>. </p>
