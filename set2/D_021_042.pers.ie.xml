<head>Local defences.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> The importance of local organization for defence, to which the <rs>Governor</rs> has very seasonably called the attention of the <name>Legislature</name>, is beginning to be appreciated by the people as well as the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The apathy into which the community was lulled by the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> is beginning to be broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>It will be recollected that, at the commencement of the war there was a very large organization of men not subject to military duty, known as the <orgName type="mil" key="HomeGuard">Home Guard</orgName>, which was comparatively well drilled and disciplined, but which afterwards, in consequence of the general indifference, was disbanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In forming, therefore, the new force recommended by the <rs>Governor</rs> for home defence, we shall nowadays have the advantage of enrolling all males of the city, but of securing a <unclear></unclear> of men, most of whom are already in a degree familiar with military drill discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>So far as the numbers and money of its fighting population are earned, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and the adjoining part <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName>, which are substantially a part of the city, can turn out quite a respectable day. But this is not all that is necessary, the defence of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The possession of this city has been the <num value="1">one</num> object heading are souls of the enemy from the being of the war. He looks upon this as his head and heart of the rebellion, and believes firmly that a blow struck here would be fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We need not point out the fallacy of that delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It is enough that such is his convictions, and that the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would unquestionably be an immense disaster, <num value="1">one</num> that would cripple our own energies and damage our cause almost irreparably in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The people, then, of this city, who are ready to a man to lay down their lives in the public defence, and the whole nation, which has such vast interests concentrated at this point, have a right to demand that every avenue of approach to the capital be efficiently guarded, and not left, like <placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Pott Royal">Pott Royal</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, to the protection of a few miserable earthworks, without proper bomb-proof defences, or means of arresting a hostile fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>There are duties of the <rs>Government</rs> to the people as well as of the people to the <rs>Government</rs>, and, both must be up to the mark, or defeat, disaster, and ruin are inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The war has thus far shown us where our strength has and where our weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The enemy has been able to accomplish no great results on land; but, with the exception of <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, he has not failed in reaching us at every point accessible to vessels which he has attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>We, therefore, call attention once more to the water avenues approaching <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and should like to know whether they have all been placed in such a state of defence as the exigency demands; whether there is a sufficient number of powerful forts on each, provided with bomb-proof shelters, and armed with the right kind of guns?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>If such is the case, then the <rs>Government</rs>, which has had the most ample time for such preparation, and been warned by the inefficiency of the miserable works at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, in competition with the enemy's powerful gunboats, has a right to demand corresponding efforts on the part of those whose interests are thus protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>A system of home defence should also embrace lines of fortifications around the capital, commanding all the approaches to it, whether by land or water, and located not only by engineering skill, but by engineers familiar from long residence with the whole character of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>No time should be lost in making the present fortification as strong as those which surround.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and in constructing others which shall combine all the improvements in this kind of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Now is the time; now, when the state of the weather has given us a temporary respite &mdash; now is the time, not only to call out the whole male force of our cities, but, above all, to construct fortifications for the city defence.--The whole <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> population of the capital and its environs ought to be employed upon this work without a moment's delay. </p> </div3>

<head>The pike is the <name>Weap</name> on of the brave.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The country is engaged in the task of defending itself against a most gigantic invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The enemy have deliberately gathered vast armies on our borders, and now they are being buried against us. The storm has mustered its rage, and now the thunderbolt is being discharged at us. Yet, not more than <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, certainly not more than half the military population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is under arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The apology for this neglect, this wasting away the interval between the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> and the present hour, is that the <rs>Government</rs> cannot command arms to place in the hands of the reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Of <placeName reg="Enfield, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2317638">Enfield</placeName> muskets, or even of fire-arms of any description, this may be true; but why not call out our whole military population, and after putting them in camps of instruction, to arm them with the <q>&#x0022;bowie-knife pike&#x0022;</q>--a terrible weapon in the hands of resolute men. An <hi rend="italics">auxiliary</hi> force thus composed and attached to each <num value="1">one</num> of our armies would always be decisive of a hard fought battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Certain it is that our country would be in a condition more formidable to the invader, if the reserve of our military population were thus armed and thus disciplined, than scattered, as at present, through the towns and rural districts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> We invoke the attention of our public authorities to the necessity of adopting some such expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If it be true, as a military principle, that <q>&#x0022;the bayonet is the weapon of the brave,&#x0022;</q> and that every closely contested fight must be determined by it, why will not a pike, barbed with a bowie-knife, do to defend the altars of freedom, and the homes of innocence and love? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> <num value="50000">Fifty thousand</num> men, armed with the <q>&#x0022;bowie-knife pike,&#x0022;</q> and disciplined to the man&#x0153;uvres of an army, would, in addition to the troops demanded by the <rs>President</rs>, be decisive of this war. Every man might not have the courage to rely upon this primitive weapon, but volunteers could be obtained to enroll themselves in this, as a corps of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>A determination, thus to place our whole military population in the field, and make the land bristle with pikes, if not with bayonets, would give confidence to many a doubting and anxious heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> The invention of gunpowder, to be employed in the open field is not, after all, an invention so decisive of the result of battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The veteran legions of C&#x00E6;sar, rushing to hand-to hand conflict, with the short <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> sword, would be as formidable now on the battlefield as they were when they overcame all opposing forces. </p> </div3>

<head>Relenting.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> The Northern despot has shown signs of relenting, after a rather guarded manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>He has issued an order for the release of all political prisoners, upon their promise not to aid the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>He announces as a reason or this that the rebellion is <q>&#x0022;manifestly at the decline!&#x0022;</q> Of a piece with this restricted indication of clemency are the declarations of the detachments of the <rs>Burnside</rs>, and other expeditions, to the people of a little hamlets they visit, that they doesn't mean to disturb private property &mdash; they won't steal any more from the people &mdash; they only want to get hold of Government stores!

The arch-traitor begins to think that persuasion may do a little better if force all the time and every where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The <unclear></unclear> reason for a change of policy, of course, is a mere falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>For a falling or fallen foe their tastes and malignities would be better suited by the most bloody revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The active use of the gibbet and the axe would be far more agreeable to them than acts of clemency or general amnesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>If they really thought the spirit of the <rs>South</rs> was giving way, they would order increased severities and brutalities &mdash; a more wide-spread and indiscriminate desolation of Southern homes.--Concession from such men is the ever sure indication of their weakness and fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This is the only rational solution of the sudden amiability of a Government that has proved itself so heartless and despotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Like a dilapidated and enfeebled reprobate who contemplates approaching dissolution and endeavors to cheat the devil by a late repentance, Old Abe seeks to avoid an apprehended retribution by doffing his animal instincts and pretending to a very liberal degree of humanity and civilization!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>His feigning is a good sign for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>His kindness shows our strength &mdash; his clemency testifies to the power of a foe he has learned to respect, and feeling that he cannot overpower he has the vanity to think he may win him by artifice and dissimulation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>I can truthfully say that no presiding officer ever received more generous confidence than the <num value="1">one</num> who now addresses you. Therefore it is with no mere formality, but with all sincerity, that I now express to you my thanks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/> <measure n="12months" type="date">Twelve months</measure> ago, we met as the representatives of <num value="6">six</num> sovereign States, for the purpose of inaugurating a new Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>Since that time, State by State has been received into our Confederacy, until now we have reached the significant number of the original <num value="13">thirteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>I may, in this connection, not inappropriately allude, though very briefly, to the action of this body having reference to this great revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>Your acts as a Convention to adopt a Constitution have been submitted to your constituents, and have received their unanimous approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Your acts, also, in your legislative capacity, have received a like approval, and I think, when the journals of this body shall be submitted to the country, nothing will be found to mar the harmony with which the result of that action is viewed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/> I may be permitted to refer to <num value="1">one</num> thought which, above all others, has characterized your action, and reflects credit upon the intelligence of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Ours is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revolution which history records, wherein the tendency has been to conservatism and stability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Popular passion and prejudice arouse and excite revolution, and lead to anarchy and the interruption of public confidence.--But the tendency of ours has been to establish conservative principles and a stable government, for the protection of persons and property, on a firm and sure foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>On the <date value="02-22">22d day of February,</date> the <name>Constitutions</name> with these conservative principles embodied, will be inaugurated for the benefit of our common country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It is an appropriate day for such a ceremony &mdash; the birthday of the father of his country &mdash; a day which will be received with coldness and formality by those who have trampled on every principle of human liberty which he consecrated with his blood, contrasted with its observance here, where we have established a new government in the place of <num value="1">one</num> so debased as to leave it almost a mockery to the memory of the man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> There is another feature which may be safely entrusted to the hands of those who are about to assume the control of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>Though we have acted with closed doors, we may now be permitted to announce to the country that <num value="1">one</num> great reason of our success has been the cordiality and harmony which has marked our intercourse with each other, and with the various departments of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>No party spirit has ever found utterance within these walls; and I now express the hope that forever and forever this announcement may be made at each successive legislative adjournment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/> When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> called to preside over your deliberations, I took the liberty to assert that our separation from the old Government was complete and eternal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>If there was at that time a shade of doubt on any mind, the history of the last few months will have dissipated it, for the sentiment now comes up from every quarter that the separation was not too soon, nor can it be too perpetual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/> Presuming that you would like to hear occasionally from this section, I send you a few notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>We have a good deal of excitement here of late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>A short time since, the enemy supposing that they would have an easy time, marched with some <num value="300">three hundred</num> cavalry to attack <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName>, but after getting within <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure> of the place they discovered our scouts and immediately beat a retreat in double-quick time back to <placeName reg="Gauley Bridge, Fayette, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118340">Gauley Bridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>We have since learned that their instructions were not to burn the place, but to plunder the stores and private dwellings of their most valuable property and destroy the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The reason assigned for not burning the town was that they wished to preserve it to quarter their troops in when they commenced their spring campaign!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/> The people of this section have been accused of disloyalty to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause by some ignorant and malicious persons, but the manner in which the men responded to the call of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, entirely refutes all such calumny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>The retreat of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> was a great disappointment to our soldiers, as they were very anxious to get a brush with them.
