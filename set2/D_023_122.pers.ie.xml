<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>About noon the enemy arrived on the hills in the rear of <placeName reg="Fairmont, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118187">Fairmont</placeName>, but kept their force out of view, being drawn up from <placeName reg="Lawson's Hill">Lawson's Hill</placeName> back as far as <persName n="Fitzhugh,Mister,John,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Fitzhugh,John,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Fitzhugh</surname></persName>'s &mdash; The enemy planted <num value="4">four</num> pieces of artillery in the skirt of woods on the hill at <persName n="Scott,Miss,Mary,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Scott,Mary,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s a commanding position.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Tuesday was a remarkably quiet day. No firing on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The only incident was the gallant conduct of <persName n="Green,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Green,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Green</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 47">47th regiment</orgName>, (at home here on special duty.) and a squad of <num value="4">four</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>As matters stand the view is by no means a pleasant <num value="1">one</num>, but we rejoice to say the sentiment is general that, if the <rs>Government</rs> thinks it will subserve the great end in view, our people are ready for the sacrifice.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Wednesday has come and gone and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> still stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Early in the forenoon batteries were planted on the hills from <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName> down to the lower ferry, on <placeName><persName n="Bray,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Bray,nomatch:0"><surname>Bray</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, a distance of over smile, and threatening to each and every part of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The hills at no point are scarcely as much as <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile from our first street, on the bank of the river, so that the proximity is intensely interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Our citizens, for the most part, take it as a joke that may be carried too far, and others don't see much about it to laugh at. During the afternoon the impression prevailed that the enemy were embarking in the vicinity of Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac river</placeName> being reported as fad of transports. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> opens in lowering style &mdash; a thick, cloudy sky, with spattering rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Along the whole range of hills, from <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName> down, stand batteries frowning and threatening destruction to the old burg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>About <time value="9:30oclock">half past 9 o'clock</time> bang, bang, was the salute, until <num value="9">nine</num> shots were discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><q>&#x0022;Where is it ?&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;What are they firing at? &#x0022;</q> were the inquiries that passed among the burgers at the corners of the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The firing was from the battery on the very high hill on the <rs type="place">Bray farm</rs> which overlooks the country for miles around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>There may have been a cavalry camp discovered on this side, or it may have been to empty the guns in consequence of the rains during the night; but as we have not been informed, and fear if we crossed over to inquire we might find some trouble in returning, we have concluded to remain where we are, and leave the matter open to conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Indeed, it might be cruel to destroy some people's conjectures by giving them the real cause of the firing; but it is believed that the <q>&#x0022;wood train&#x0022;</q> was fired at after it left the railroad depot to go down the road. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> A large foraging party went down the river road into <placeName reg="Stafford, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2114347">Stafford</placeName>, and will probably continue its depredations into <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The train consisted of <num value="175">175</num> wagons, and had with it <num value="4">four</num> pieces of artillery, <num value="2">two</num> infantry and <num value="2">two</num> cavalry companies.--There could not well have been a more disagreeable night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The rain fell with unremitting constancy, and the air was chilly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This morning (<dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>) all continues quiet between the <num value="2">two</num> forces, except now and then the tattoo of a far off <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> drum, or the sound of a cavalryman's bugle, falls upon the ear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The writer in the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> writing later than the above says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> That the army in front has been of large proportions we have no reason to doubt, but many facts to establish; but, at the same time, we are impressed with the conviction that this decided demonstration is a feint, and that <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,A.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> concluded that he could do this and yet lose but little, if any, time in embarking his army at points along the <rs>Potomac</rs> &mdash; Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> and Potomac <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>--for the real point of attack on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The main column for this attack will, we believe, move via <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName>, and probably lesser columns from other points. </p> </q><bibl n="Herald,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac river</placeName> was covered with vessels of all sizes and kinds, mainly of the transport order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>That these vessels were intended to carry off the army is an opinion entertained by many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Enough of the army will be left over the river though to <q> &#x0022;keep up appearances&#x0022;</q> We shall not be surprised if by <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the main bulk of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,A.,E.,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s force is well on its way to their new destination, though of course this is a conjecture to a great extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We understand that Federal prisoners captured, estimate their numbers at over <num value="100000">100,000</num>, but we doubt the figures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The Confederate force here is under officers in whom our people can well afford to repose trust, and be the battle here or remote, there is no cause to fear the result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> We deem it but proper to say that others differ with us in regard to <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,A.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s movements, and insist that this will be the base of his operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> Of course, under this impression, many families have left town and others are leaving. </p> </div3>
