<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Having but a moment of leisure, I have thought a few items of news might not be uninteresting to you, though, I must confess, the thermometer at an almost unvarying height since <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> excites some fear of reaching a respectable length of epistle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> You scarcely find out many occurrences from a point as distant as this, especially so isolated by the craziest mail arrangements that the world ever saw. I hesitate to venture on news by mail fearing lest battles might be fought, victories won, and our own armies snugly quartered in New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> are this reaches you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, you know, is now, in territory, the <rs>Empire State</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and having in her Legislature, within the last few days, rescinded the law by which she granted so much of her <name>North</name> and <name>North</name>east to the old Union, she will soon assume the proportions of <num value="1">one</num> of the divisions of the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> From the <rs>Sabine</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, the croons were never so abundant; and, strange to tell, though for <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> past the corn has been almost a failure, this year it is almost too large to be gathered, and but for the difficulty of transportation, she could furnish vast supplies for our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The cation crop is a good <num value="1">one</num>--not from the luxuriance of the plant, as it shows the ravages of the worm &mdash; but because they have the most delightful weather in which to save it, but so long as the blockade continues it yields the planter nothing, and though it is their chief wealth, they would rather burn it than send a bale of it away, or suffer it to fall into <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>A small party has been anxious to send some overland to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and ship from <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, professedly; but sound and almost universal sentiment is against it, for it is well known there are some <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> here yet, who are willing at any hazard to enrich themselves, if not advantage the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Within a few days the <rs>Governor</rs> has prohibited the storing of cotton or removal from the plantations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> I have never seen such lovely weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The doors and windows have hardly been closed this winter, and there has not been a respectable <hi rend="italics">norther</hi> to necessitate the building of fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The Governor has within the last week called out the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The State, though late waking up, will contribute her share in this war. Every man is mounted or armed after a fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The very children have caught a martial spirit, and dash over the prairies most wildly on their mustangs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Companies, battalions, and regiments of cavalry, artillery, and infantry are forming and concentrating in various portions of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Among these forces I must mention a mounted regiment of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> Lancers, the only <num value="1">one</num> in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> under the command of <persName n="Carter,Colonel,G.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Carter,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Carter</surname></persName>, formerly of your State, but now <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of <orgName n="Soule University" type="university">Soule University</orgName>, of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> --It seems quite clear, from all we can see, that, contrary to what was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> believed to be the fact, the <rs>British Minister</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> has presented no demand for the restitution of <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, nor, as far as we are able to judge, is it at all certain that any such demand will be presented as long as the present Ministry continue in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/><persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> has too often cringed to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> insolence to leave any hope that he, at least, has any care for the honor of the <rs>British</rs> flag; and the powers at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> evidently knew with whom they had to deal when they committed <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prison, instead of returning them to a British deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>If we are to believe the <orgName n="London Post" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Post</hi></orgName>, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>'s organ, the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> has already offered his mediation, and it has been accepted at the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The same paper tells us that &#x0022;the matter in dispute is a legal question.&#x0022; And so is a blow in the face, or <unclear>a tweak </unclear> of the nose; but, as private individuals, when they refer such offences to the decision of a legal tribunal, are generally content to put their honor in their pockets, so, we presume, the <rs>Ministers</rs> of the <rs>British Queen</rs> have determined that, so far as the honor of the <name>Crown</name> is concerned, it must be left to shift for itself. &#x0022;The Attorney and <rs type="role" reg="Solicitor-General">Solicitor Generals</rs> are not infallible; they may be wrong, and it does not become the greatness and majesty of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to involve the world in war on a point of law, respecting which the most profound lawyers differ.&#x0022;--This is stepping down from a high horse with a vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> had just before declared that, before the question could even be touched, the honor of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> must be satisfied by the restoration of <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> to the deck of an English vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>So far as we are able to judge from the extract published above, it does not appear even that a demand for restoration will be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>At the very moment when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are preparing to comply with any demand the <rs>British Government</rs> may make, the <rs>British Government</rs> puts its honor in the hands of the lawyers, and goes to law for its character, like an alderman whose reputation has been assailed, or a play actor, who brings his action of defamation against the proprietor of a newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Apropos of the umpire chosen on the occasion, the <hi rend="italics">Post</hi> goes on to say, &#x0022;the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> having offered himself as a mediator, the obvious inference is that he will not join <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> in a war with <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.&#x0022; And this is precisely the principal cause of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>'s present attitude, in face of the insulted flag of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>He once before attempted to prostitute the honor of the nation, to the desire to please the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, and would have succeeded in doing it, had not the <rs>English</rs> people forbidden the desecration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> There is, however, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, a power behind the throne much greater than <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, or than the <rs>Queen</rs> who sits upon it. That is the <rs>British</rs> nation &mdash; the proudest, and let us add what is but bare justice, the <hi rend="italics">greatest</hi> people of whom we have any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Sensitive to a degree almost reprehensible upon the point of honor, we conceive it to be hardly possible that they will submit to an insult so palpable, so direct, and so out rageous, as that offered by <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> to the flag which is their pride and glory &mdash; that &#x0022;meteor flag&#x0022; which <num value="1">one</num> of their poets proudly and justly tells us has withstood &#x0022;for a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> the battle and the breeze.&#x0022;--There have been, in her history, many instances of attempts on the part of ministers and kings, to degrade that flag; but not <num value="1">one</num> in which the attempt has not been visited with quick and signal retribution.
