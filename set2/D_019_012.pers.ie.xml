<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> <persName n="Seward,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> made his long looked for speech in the <rs>Senate Saturday</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The conclusion of it contains the gist of his argument &mdash; certainly his declarations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> So far as the abstract question whether, by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, the bondsman, who is made such by the laws of a State, is still a man or only property, <num value="1">1</num> answer that, within that State, its laws on that subject are supreme; that when he has escaped from that State into another, the <rs>Constitution</rs> regards him as a bondsman who may not, by any law or regulation of that State, be discharged from his service, but shall be delivered up on claim, to the party to whom his service is due. </p> </q><bibl n="Senator Seward"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> While prudence and justice would combine in persuading you to modify the acts of Congress on that subject, so as not to oblige private persons to assist in their execution, and to protect freemen from being, by abuse of the laws, carried into slavery, I agree that all laws of the <name>States</name>, which relate to this class of persons, or any others recently coming from or resident in other States, and which laws contravene the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, or any law of Congress passed in conformity thereto, ought to be repealed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Secondly. Experience in public affairs has confirmed my opinion, that domestic slavery, existing in any State, is wisely left by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> exclusively to the care, management and disposition of that State; and if it were in my power, I would not alter the <rs>Constitution</rs> in that respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If misapprehension of my position needs so strong a remedy, I am willing to vote for an amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, declaring that it shall not, by any future amendment, be so altered as to confer on Congress a power to abolish or interfere with slavery in any State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> Thirdly. While I think that Congress has exclusive and sovereign authority to legislate on all subjects whatever, in the common <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and while I certainly shall never, directly or indirectly, give my vote to establish or sanction slavery in such Territories, or anywhere else in the world yet the question what constitutional laws shall at any time be passed in regard to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, is, like every other question, to be determined on practical grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I voted for enabling acts in the cases of <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, without being able to secure in them such provisions as I would have preferred; and yet I voted wisely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> So now, I am well satisfied that, under existing circumstances, a happy and satisfactory solution of the difficulties in the remaining <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> territories would be obtained by similar laws, providing for their organization, if such organization were otherwise practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If, therefore, <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> was admitted as a State, under the <rs n="Wyandot" type="nativeamerican">Wyandotte</rs> Constitution, as I think she ought to be, and if the organic laws of all the other territories could be repealed, I could vote to authorize the organization and admission of <num value="2">two</num> new States which should include them, reserving the right to effect subdivisions of them whenever necessary into several convenient States; but I do not find that such reservations could be constitutionally made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> Without them, the ulterior embarrassments which would result from the hasty incorporation of States of such vast extent and various interests and character, would out weigh all the immediate advantages of such a measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>But if the measure were practicable, I should prefer a different course, namely: when the eccentric movements of secession and disunion shall have ended, in whatever form that end may come, and the angry excitements of the hour shall have subsided, and calmness once more shall have resumed its accustomed away over the public mind, then, and hot until then--<num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> hence &mdash; I should cheerfully advise a Convention of the people, to be assembled in pursuance of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to consider and decide whether any and what amendments of the organic national law ought to be made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> now &mdash; as I have heretofore been a member of other parties existing in my day &mdash; I nevertheless hold and cherish, as I have always done, the principle that this Government exists in its present form only by the consent of the governed, and that it is as necessary as it is wise, to resort to the people for revisions of the organic law when the troubles and dangers of the <rs>State</rs> certainly transcend the powers delegated by it to the public authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Nor ought the suggestion to excite surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Government in any form is a machine; this is the most complex <num value="1">one</num> that the mind of man has ever invented, or the hand of man has ever framed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Perfect as it is, it ought to be expected that it will, at least as often as once in a century, require some modification to adapt it to the changes of society and alterations of empire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Fourthly, I hold myself ready now, as always heretofore, to vote for any properly guarded laws which shall be deemed necessary to prevent mutual invasions of States by citizens of other States, and punish those who shall aid and abet them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> Fifthly, Notwithstanding the arguments of the gallant <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, (<persName n="Lane,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lane</surname></persName>,) I remain of the opinion that physical bonds, such as high ways, railroads, rivers and canals, are vastly more powerful for holding civil communities together than any mere covenants, though written on parchment or engraved upon iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>I remain, therefore, constant to my purpose to secure, if possible, the construction of <num value="2">two</num> Pacific railways, <num value="1">one</num> of which shall connect the ports around the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, and the other the towns on the <rs>Missouri</rs> and the lakes, with the harbors on our Western coast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> If, on the expression of these views, I have not proposed what is desired or expected by many others, they will do me the justice to believe that I am as far from having suggested what in many respects would have been in harmony with cherished convictions of my own. I learned early from <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, that in political affairs we cannot always do what seems to us absolutely best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Those with whom we must necessarily act, entertaining different views, have the power and right of carrying them into practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We must be content to lead when we can, and to follow when we cannot lead; and if we cannot at any time do for our country all the good that we would wish, we must be satisfied with doing for her all the good that we can. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> Having submitted my own opinions on this great crisis, it remains only to say that I shall cheerfully lend to the government my best support in whatever prudent yet energetic efforts it shall make to preserve the <rs>Union</rs>, advising, only, that it practice as far as possible, the utmost moderation, forbearance and conciliation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> And, now, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, what are the auspices of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I know that we are in the midst of alarms, and somewhat exposed to accidents unavoidable in seasons of tempestuous passions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>We already have disorder, and violence has begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I know not to what extent it may go. Still my faith in the <rs>Constitution</rs> and in the <rs>Union</rs> abides, because my faith in the wisdom and virtue of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people remains unshaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Coolness, calmness, and resolution, are elements of their character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>They have been temporarily displaced; but they are reappearing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Soon enough, I trust, for safety, it will be seen that sedition and violence are only local and temporary, and that loyalty and affection to the <rs>Union</rs> are the natural sentiments of the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Whatever dangers there shall be, there will be the determination to meet them; whatever sacrifices, private or public, shall be needful for the <rs>Union</rs>, they will be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>I feel sure that the hour has not come for this great nation to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>This people, which has been studying to become wiser and better as it has grown older, is not perverse or wicked enough to deserve so dreadful and severe a punishment as dissolution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> This Union has not yet accomplished what good or mankind was manifestly designed by Him who appoints the seasons and prescribes the duties of States and empires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>No, sir; if it were cast down by factions to-day, it would rise again and reappear in all its majestic proportions to morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It is the only government that can stand here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Woe! Woe! to the man that madly lifts his hand against it. It shall continue and endure; and men, in after times, shall declare that this generation, which saved the <rs>Union</rs> from such sudden and unlooked for dangers, surpassed in magnanimity even that <num value="1">one</num> which laid its foundations in the eternal principles of liberty, justice and humanity. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> Commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> have laid before the <rs>Convention</rs> an interesting statement of their interviews with the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>We make the following extract: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> On <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-12-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, several of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> delegation, including ourselves, waited upon the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>At this time, there was a growing belief that reinforcements were on the eve of being sent to the forts in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It was known that the subject was frequently and earnestly discussed in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It was rumored that <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> and <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Holt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName> were urgent that reinforcements should be sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Upon our being announced, the <rs>President</rs>, who was then in <orgName n="Cabinet Council" type="council">Cabinet Council</orgName>, came out to us in the ante-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>We at once entered into a conversation upon the topic, which was so closely occupying his thoughts as well as ours.--<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> seemed much disturbed and moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He told us that he had had a painful interview with the wife of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, who had come on from New York to see him. She had manifested great anxiety and distress at the situation of her husband, whom she seemed to consider in momentary danger of an attack from an excited and lawless mob. <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> professed a deep responsibility resting upon him to protect the lives of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> and his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>We told him that the news that reinforcements were on their way to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, would be the surest means of provoking what <persName n="Anderson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> apprehended, and what he so much deprecated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>We said, further, that we did not believe that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was in danger of such an attack; that the general sentiment of the <rs>State</rs> was against any such proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>That, prior to the action of the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>, then only <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> off, we felt satisfied that there would be no attempt to molest the forts in any way.--That, after the <rs>Convention</rs> met &mdash; while we could not possibly undertake to say what that body would see fit to do &mdash; we yet hoped and believed that nothing would be done until we had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> endeavored, by duly accredited Commissioners, to negotiate for a peaceful settlement of all matters, including the delivery of the forts, between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>At the same time, we again reiterated our solemn belief that any change in the then existing condition of things in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> would, in the excited state of feeling at home, inevitably precipitate a collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The impression made upon us was, that the <rs>President</rs> was wavering, and had not decided what course he would pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He said he was glad to have had this conversation with us, but would prefer that we should give him a written memorandum of the substance of what we had said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>This we did on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>We told him we did not so understand it. We were expressing our convictions and belief, predicated upon the maintenance of a certain condition of <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> things, which maintenance was absolutely and entirely <hi rend="italics">in his power.</hi> If he maintained such condition, then we believed that collision would be avoided until the attempt at a peaceable negotiation had failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>If he did not, then we solemnly assured him that we believed collision must inevitably, and at once, be precipitated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>He seemed satisfied, and said it was not his intention to send reinforcements, or make any change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>We explained to him what we meant by the words &#x0022;relative military status,&#x0022; as applied to the forts; mentioned the difference between <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s occupying his then position at <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, and throwing himself into <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>We stated that the latter step would be equivalent to reinforcing the garrison, and would just as certainly, as the sending of fresh troops, lead to the result which we both desired to avoid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>When we rose to go, the <rs>President</rs> said in substance, &#x0022;After all, this is a matter of honor among gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>That would put us, who are willing to use our personal influence to prevent any attack upon the forts before Commissioners are sent on to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, in rather an embarrassing position.&#x0022; &#x0022;Then,&#x0022; said the <rs>President</rs>, &#x0022;I would <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> return you this paper.&#x0022; We do not pretend to give the exact words on either side, but we are sure we give the sense of both. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>It has seized upon and destroyed the peace of society, rended the religious institutions of the country, and has at last reached a point where forbearance is no longer possible.--He then proceeded to speak of slavery as an institution which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> approves. --It was instituted by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself, on <placeName reg="Mount Sinai, Pike, Ohio" key="tgn,2527455">Mount Sinai</placeName>, when in the commandments he said thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's servant.--The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> slave catcher was an angel, the second was <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>It is an institution sustained by all scriptural authorities &mdash; ordained by <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, recognized by his chosen people, countenanced and sustained by the <name>Saviour</name> and his Apostles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The result of its establishment in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Colonies had been prosperity unparallel to the white race, and civilization to the black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>The cultivation of cotton was another great result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Cotton was now <num value="1">one</num> of the great governing powers of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>It is with the products of slave labor that we settle up the balance accounts with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, every year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>It keeps up the banks, it keep up the ships, it keeps up the works, shops, and does more than that &mdash; it puts <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> under bonds to keep the peace with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Yet, with all these lights before them, they have advanced and laid their hands upon this institution of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> Almighty, and said &#x0022;stand back &mdash; we are holier than thou.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> The speaker then alluded to the abolition of slavery in the fairest isle of the ocean, by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and what was the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> man got his freedom, and went down, down, to heathen idolatry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>In the <rs>North</rs>, where the shackles had been struck off, the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> had suck to poverty or to insanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Is not the hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in this!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>And yet they come and say to you, you must liberate these people or you must be damned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/> The &#x0022;irrepressible conflict&#x0022; doctrine was next considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>The election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was upon the avowed declaration that slavery is a sin and that the curse of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is upon it, and how they flaunt their banners in our faces with this principle inscribed thereon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>It was an easy thing to surrender property and position, but for a <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> to surrender his honor, was something he could not conceive of. They demand of you an acknowledgment of your inferiority or they demand your blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> knows, he said, they shall have every drop of my blood before I will surrender <num value="1">one</num> iota to their demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>He had come to cast his lot with <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and would live if she said so, or die for her if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>He could see no hope for the future, but through our own united opposition to wrong. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/> The circumstances of the election of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> were adverted to, as well as his subsequent acts as <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>He had been true to his political pledges, true to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and true to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>But that was insufficient to satisfy the fanatics of the <rs>North</rs>, and they stigmatized and vilified the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The insidious serpent of abolitionism crept into the council chamber of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>He would gladly pass over this phase in the history of the country if he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>He had believed that a great controversy was about to arise, which it required wisdom, forbearance and prudence to meet, or it would end in blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>He had never wanted to go into the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, and when he became the subject of vituperation by official aspirants, he under took so to dispose of the business in his hands, that it might be said, &#x0022;this man has done his duty.&#x0022; It was due to the truth of history to say, that in the terrific controversy through which <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was going, he had not been quite so strongly sustained by the <rs>South</rs> as he ought to have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>But perhaps it was natural that he could not come quite so near the wishes of the <rs>South</rs>, as a son could come to the wishes of his mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>He alluded to the <num value="2">two</num> policies set forth in the annual Message <persName n="Black,Mister,Attorney,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="default:Black,Attorney,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Attorney</foreName> <surname>Black</surname></persName> said we must execute the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>I, said <persName n="Floyd,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, could not quite bow to that, <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> said, this question of the forts is a question of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>I agreed to that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>I said more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>I said, I am your <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>, and have in my hands this property of the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>I will turn over to my successor that property inviolate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>I know these people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>I went to school among them.--I know they are not thieves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/><persName n="Hayne,,Isaac,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="default:Hayne,Isaac,,,"><foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Hayne</surname></persName>, Mentganit and F auk Pickeus are good men &mdash; they are greatmen &mdash; and I will back their honesty and integrity, it necessary, with my blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>But I cannot consent that you place among them a military power that would choke them to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>At a subsequent interview with the <rs>President</rs>, he said to me: --&#x0022;<persName n="Floyd,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, what about sending recruits to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> I&#x0022; Said I, &#x0022;Nothing about sending recruits.&#x0022; &#x0022;Don't you intend to strengthen the forts at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>?&#x0022; he asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>I replied &#x0022;I do not.&#x0022; Said he, &#x0022;I would rather be at the bottom of the <rs>Potomac</rs> to-morrow, than that these forts should be in the hands of those who intend to take them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>It will destroy me &mdash; it will cover your name, which is an honored <num value="1">one</num>, with infamy, for you will never be able to show that you had not some complicity in it.&#x0022; I said, &#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, trust me, there is no danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>I will stake my reputation and I will stake my life that the forts of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> will not be touched.&#x0022; I said this because I felt it. <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> then said, &#x0022;But, <persName n="Floyd,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, does that secure the forts?&#x0022; &#x0022;No, sir,&#x0022; said I; &#x0022;but it is the best guarantee I can give you that they will not be touched.&#x0022; He replied, &#x0022;I am not satisfied.&#x0022; Said I, &#x0022;It is yours to command, and you will be obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>You can strengthen the forts, but it will lead to the effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>You can, however, put an orderly sergeant there &mdash; a man with a worsted epaulette and with a stripe on his pantaloons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>He is a representative man [laughter]--the representative of the stars and stripes and of Hail Columbia and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>He can stand there and so proclaim himself, and his authority will be respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Mean while, submit to Congress his question of the secession of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Congress may say a State has a right to withdraw, or may say, we reputed the right of secession &mdash; we will send <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> down our armies to coerce you to submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Do this, and I will a wait the issue.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/> I stayed there, gentlemen, with pain and suspense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>I wanted help, and I called for help from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, that good old mother that gave me birth, and I called upon <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, that bright Saladin of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>[Applause.] They came, <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,Thomas,L.,,:1"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, [renewed applause,] with the patriots of the country, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, and talked with the <rs>President</rs>.--He then said, &#x0022;I am content with your policy &mdash; we will send no more troops to the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.&#x0022; Then, gentlemen, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, I felt a sensation of delight in my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>I then thought the question capable of peaceable solution, and though you may not think it worthy of mention, I devoutly returned thanks to Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> The speaker next alluded to the course of <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName>, then <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, whom he pronounced <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest specimens of mankind, whose personal virtues he had never ceased to revere, after <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/><persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> said: <q>&#x0022;These forts must be strengthened &mdash; I demand it.&#x0022;</q> This, gentlemen, is the <rs>Northern</rs> sentiment, and in his position the <rs>Secretary</rs> reflected the minds of his people.--And when the <rs>President</rs> replied, with stern inflexibility--&#x0022;I have considered this question &mdash; I am sorry to differ with the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>--out the interests of the country do not demand a reinforcement of the forts at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> &mdash; I cannot do it &mdash; I take the responsibility&#x0022;--then, gentlemen, my hopes for the future grew stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>That is what he said.--The next day this glorious old premier sent in his resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>With the respect I had entertained for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, I said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed you to your home in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>[Laughter.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> Thus matters stood, when there came a proposition to send for <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>I said send &mdash; gladly I said send for him. <persName n="Scott,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="default:Scott,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>He had other ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>He was a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>I had not thought what would be the sentiments of a soldier who had been winning laurels in the field when I was in my swaddling clothes, I thought of him as a man whom <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> delighted to honor &mdash; who had the decorations of the <rs>State</rs> in a magnificent gold medal dangling from his neck, and a sword of hers which I supposed was bright enough and sharp enough to defend the honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>But he had a programme &mdash; a plan to allay all these spectres of disunion and bring peace to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>He laid it before me as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>I told him I did not like it. He laid it before the <rs>President</rs>, and he did not much like it at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>I'll tell you what it was. <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was to be taken possession of, and <placeName reg="Castle Pinckney">Castle Pinckney</placeName> likewise.--<placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> was to be strengthened.--The forts of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> were to be occupied and held, the forts of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> taken possession of and manned, and the forts of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> occupied by troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>In addition to this, ships of war and revenue cutters were to be sent to the waters of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>This was the programme and this the plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>I had been <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and had not thought it necessary to occupy any of these forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>It was not in the programme that any of the <rs>Northern</rs> forts should be occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Nay, more; troops were to be removed from thence and stationed in Southern forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>As a <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> and a Southern I man could not shut my eyes to the fact that this was trampling on our political rights, and that all this military display was to wipe out all our pretensions to honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I am afraid I tire you, gentlemen--[Cries of &#x0022;go on! &#x0022; &#x0022;go on!&#x0022;] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/> There was a <sic>corrollary</sic> to be deduced from all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>However right it might be as the position of a military leader, it presupposes a state of facts which I never acknowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>It is that the <orgName n="United States Confederation" type="federation">confederation of the United States</orgName>, which has been made by the sovereign States, should be endowed with power to crush that which created it. Here is the coercive policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>The whole <rs>North</rs> instantly rallied to the point of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Black Republicanism was infused with new life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>However, I determined to stay until the result of the mission from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had transpired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Mark you that conciliatory speeches had been made by Northern men, and the <rs>Northern</rs> public was fast rallying under the banner of anti-coercion, when the announcement of this policy changed the whole aspect of things. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/> Next came the unfortunate affair of Maj <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,M.,W.,,"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The instructions of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> did not authorize him to change his position &mdash; for he wrote to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> and said he could change his position if he had authority to do so. I had pledged my honor to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>--and although I will not swear it, I think the <rs>President</rs> said so, too.--<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> with <num value="20">20</num> men could have gone to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> any moonlight night and taken it. But there was an insurmountable barrier &mdash; they had pledged their honor that it should not be. [Applause.] <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,M.,W.,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, for what reason <name n="God" type="God">God</name> only knows, saw fit to change his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, said you have violated your pledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>I said, gentlemen, I have not. All I can do is to resign my commission into the hands of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>I did so, gentlemen, and here I am. [Prolonged cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/> This brings us to the last topic to be considered in this prolix and I fear tiresome speech [Go on.] There is a policy of coercion on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and anti-coercion on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The <rs>North</rs> must decide this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>It is peace or war. And the question comes up &mdash; shall the pretext of holding the forts of the <rs>South</rs> be made the pretext of sending men and arms to coerce the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>I tell you that is the plan on foot, and you have got to meet it. The sluggard and the coward may hug the delusive hope of better times, but there will be no better times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>This is what you have got to look to. I speak to you as <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>--who have done so much for this <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName>--<rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, whose blood alone, of all the <name>States</name>, was strewn over every field from <placeName reg="Quebec" key="tgn,7005804">Quebec</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7014152" n="1.000 7" reg="eutaw, greene, alabama">Eutaw</placeName>, to purchase our glorious liberties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> In the money scale you stand still higher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Never was so magnificent a guerdon given to the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> as you gave in territory to this very free-soil principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>This power now turns upon you and says, We demand <hi rend="italics">this</hi> of you, or we will coerce you into obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Look at the history of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The speaker referred to <persName n="Hamilton,,Alexander,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="default:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Adams,,John,Q.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="default:Adams,John,Q.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Q.</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> &mdash; generally regarded as the great arch enemies of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> freedom &mdash; yet they repudiated as monstrous the doctrine of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Yet now it is not only boldly proclaimed, but carried into actual operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Are you ready to stand for your equality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>[Yes! yes!] Now is the day and now is the hour to occupy a position of security.
