<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the enclosed resolution of the <name>Senate</name>, requesting you to give them information concerning the pay and appointment of Provost Marshals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> The army regulations provide for the employment, by a <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> or a General of Division, of Provost Marshals, who are charged with the custody of prisoners and the performance of police duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>In garrisons, non commissioned officers are usually assigned to these duties; but, with armies of the field, deprived as they are of the assistance of the civil authorities, and often encumbered with large numbers of prisoners, the duties become more difficult and important, and commissioned officers are detailed for their discharge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> It will be observed that Provost Marshals are <hi rend="italics">employed,</hi> not <hi rend="italics">appointed;</hi> otherwise, officers of the army already holding commissions, could not be assigned to such duty without holding <num value="2">two</num> distinct appointments from the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> It having been found that large amounts of public property at our principal depots, and the peace and good order of many of our towns, were endangered by the numerous stragglers from the army, and camp followers hanging about them, and that desertion from the army was encouraged by the want of persons at these points authorized to make arrests, the <name>Department</name> employed Provost Marshals, and vested them with authority over all persons in the army found within their respective limits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> <hi rend="italics">They have no authority whatever over persons not in the army, except when martial law is in force,</hi> in which localities their police powers are extended to citizens as well as soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> Whether martial law exist or not they are expressly prohibited by a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> from exercising civil jurisdiction, and the <name>Department</name> has checked them in all cases in which the exercise of such jurisdiction has been made the subject of complaint. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> Many of the <rs>Provost Marshals</rs> of posts where martial law is not in force have fallen into the error of supposing themselves to be clothed with general police powers, but the <name>Department</name> has invariably informed them when such cases were brought to its attention, that they could derive the power to arrest citizens from the civil magistrates only. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> Their compensation is usually fixed at that of a captain of infantry; but in some few cases they have been allowed the pay of field officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The reference to the army grade is merely for the purpose of fixing their rate of compensation, and does not confer on them grade or commission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> The employment of Provost Marshals and Provost guards, is essential to the preservation of public property, to the peace and good order of our chief towns, and to the very existence of the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> They are paid by the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>, because the army regulations require that department to pay the incidental expenses of the army, including generally all proper and authorized expenses for the movements and operations of the army, not expressly assigned to other departments </p>
