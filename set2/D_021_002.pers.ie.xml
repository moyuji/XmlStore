<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>For <num value="3">three</num> month the <rs>North</rs> has had a force at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> which, according to its own account, outnumbered our own <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, which has had abundant time for discipline, and has at its command an immense amount and infinite variety of arms, ammunition, and equipments of war. And yet, whilst the winter has thus far been the mildest on record, whilst the roads have been as firm and smooth as in midsummer, whilst this delightful weather has presented a daily invitation of &#x0022;Come on&#x0022;--the <rs>Federal</rs> army continues to lie sluggish, torpid, and motionless, behind its entrenchments on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/><q>&#x0022;If you are coming, why don't you come along?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> Amongst the variety of speculations upon the real cause of this long-continued delay, the theory is gaining ground that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> does not intend to advance till the period arrives when the term of enlistment of our volunteers expires, and when, in consequence of their return to their homes, the <rs>Southern Army</rs> will be so reduced in numbers as to present but a feeble barrier to his immense masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Notwithstanding the vaporing of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers, it is evident that, even with heavy odds, they have no stomach for encountering the chances of another <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The Southern expeditions, it was fondly hoped, would draw off a great body of the <rs>Southern</rs> troops to the defence of their own firesides, and inspire the successors of the <rs>Bull Runners</rs> with courage enough to make an advance movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>But this hope failing, there remains but <num value="1">one</num> equally promising opportunity,--the expiration of the term of duty of the volunteer,--and the belief is now gaining ground that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> will await that moment before making his onward movement, and that then, when our camps are deserted, or the vacant places supplied by troops who cannot, by any possibility, in the interval now remaining, be made the equals of the present volunteer army in drill and efficiency, the <rs>Federal</rs> forces will make their grand, and long-promised onward movement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> We are aware that Congress has legislated with a view to encourage re-enlistment, but we have not learned that its legislation has, to any great extent, secured the object designed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Our volunteers did not enter the army for money, though they have had a right to expect the treatment due to gentlemen and to soldiers; treatment which would have been of far more service in attaching them to their cause, than any pecuniary advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>This treatment they have not always received; there have been civil and military officials whose heartless and brutal neglect have put the <rs>Southern</rs> cause in more peril, than all the armed legions of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>More even than this cause, the rust of inaction, to which they have been condemned, has eaten out some of the bravest spirits; and these facts, as well known to the enemy in their front as to any <num value="1">one</num> in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, have emboldened them with the hope that, at the expiration of their time of enlistment, our volunteers will return to their homes, and that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will then fall, almost without resistance, into their hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> We trust that these confident expectations are destined to inevitable disappointment Certainly we have formed a false conception of the character of <orgName n="Southern Volunteers" type="volunteers">Southern volunteers</orgName> if they, like the <orgName n="Northern volunteers" type="volunteers">Northern volunteers</orgName>, are bent upon forsaking their camp when their time is up, no matter what the danger by which the country is menaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Indeed, such a supposition would be more derogatory to Southern than to <orgName n="Northern volunteers" type="volunteers">Northern volunteers</orgName>, because when the latter left they injured nobody but themselves, and did not expose their territory and their homes to foreign invasion, whilst the withdrawal of <orgName n="Southern Volunteers" type="volunteers">Southern volunteers</orgName> would leave the way to their own fields and firesides open to an invading horde, who declare that their time for submission and compromise has forever gone and who are panting to bring desolation and defilement upon every Southern home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Let this tremendous crusade become successful, either by mismanagement in the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>&#x0022;</q>--or, we may add, by the refusal of volunteers to re-enlist--<q>&#x0022;or cowardice and greediness at home, and history furnishes no page so dark and bloody as that which would record the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Our best and bravest men would be slaughtered like bullocks in the shambles; our wives and daughters' dishonored before our eyes; our cities sacked; our fields laid waste; our homes pillaged and burned; our property, which we are perhaps selfishly boarding, wrested from us by fines and confiscations; our grand old Commonwealth degraded from her proud historic place of Ancient Dominion, to be the vassal province of a huge central despotism, which, having wasted her with fire and sword, would compel her by military force to pay the enormous expense of her own subjugation, or in default of this, parcel out her broad lands to insulting emigrants as a feudal reward for the rapine and murder of this new <persName n="Norman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Norman,nomatch:0"><surname>Norman</surname></persName> conquest; whilst the owners of these lands must either remain as cowering factors for insolent conquerors and oppressive lords, or wander as penniless and homeless fugitives in a land of strangers.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> Nor would this be the fate of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Then, from their different bases of operation upon the sea coast, the invading armies would advance to penetrate the interior and unite with the <rs>Grand Army</rs> of subjugation on its resistless Southern march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Then, wo, wo, to the conquered in every Southern State, and every Southern habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>All this, and worse &mdash; horrors, unimaginable horrors in every Southern home and every Southern plantation, rise before the eye. And can it be possible that Southern men, the husbands of Southern wives, the sons of Southern mothers, the brothers of Southern sisters, by refusing to re-enlist, can expose their country and all they hold dear to this bottomless abyss of woe and perdition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We cannot believe it. The conduct of the <orgName n="Northern volunteers" type="volunteers">Northern volunteers</orgName>, who left when their time was up, but who imperilled neither home nor fireside by their leaving, would be glorious in comparison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> Rather than submit to a fate like this, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> the hardships, the privations, the petty official insolence of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, or of a life time, ought to be borne with alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It would be better, far better, that our brave soldiers had not put their hand to the plough at all than that, having put it there, they should turn back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Better to have made no resistance to Northern tyranny than, having made it sufficiently to inflame and intensify the malignity and vengeance of our enemies, it should be withdrawn at the very moment that it is necessary for our protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>A few, more months beyond the period of enlistment will, in all probability, terminate the struggle, if our gallant soldiers prove as persevering as they are brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>That they should desire to see their homes again is natural, and the act of Congress has made provision for this purpose, if they desire to re-enlist; but what will home be worth if, for the purpose of enjoying it for a brief period, they put it in peril of perpetual ruin?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Hence, in view of all these solemn considerations, we indignantly reject the idea that <orgName n="Southern Volunteers" type="volunteers">Southern volunteers</orgName> will hesitate on the subject of re-enlistment <num value="1">one</num> moment after they become apprised of the trick to which <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> looks for our destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> We sincerely hope soon to hear of some general consultation and conclusion among the soldiers whose term of enlistment soon expires, which will give assurance both to the country and its enemies that no expectation of Southern conquest and subjugation need be based upon the delusion that they will fail to re-enlist at the end of their term. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> We are inclined to believe that it is not the intention of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that we should owe our independence to any agency but our own exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Independence of the <rs>North</rs> would certainly lose half its value, and indeed its reality, if we should have to owe it to the interference of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in our behalf.--Our security in the future against invasion from the <rs>North</rs>, would be much greater if this contest were fought out to success by our own unaided prowess, than if we called in the assistance of a foreign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>In the teeth of such an alliance the <rs>North</rs> might speedily consent to peace; in order, by a system of chicanery and deception, to detach from us the affections of our ally; and, after the alienation, to renew its schemes of subjugation and conquest upon ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> It may not be the design of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> to permit our independence to rest upon so precarious a basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Not only would success so achieved be indecisive of the struggle we are engaged in with the <rs>North</rs>, but the power to which we should apparently owe it would regard us as debtors and dependants to itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>This very feeling on its part would be the fruitful source of reproaches, ill-feeling, and at last of ill-blood; and our wary Northern adversary, watching the growth of the quarrel, would be quick to avail himself of every means of fomenting an outbreak. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> In our case as that of every struggling nationality; <q>&#x0022;who would be free, themselves must strike the blow.&#x0022;</q> To owe our independence to any other aid than our own right arms, would materially lower our rank among nations, and embarrass our relations with them for many series of years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Our independence, if self-achieved, would give us a position of our own in the family of nations, and we should not become the helpless part of a great system of politics of which a patron power was at the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Our international politics would be <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">sut genesis,</foreign></hi> and not the mere reflex of <name>British</name>, <name>French</name>, or any other phase or system of policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>We should be the masters of our own action, the fashioners of our own policy, not borrowers of the policy of higher and greater powers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> Our territory is so considerable and so well situated, and our population and wealth so great, that, if achieving our independence without aid, we could at once take a high rank, and rapidly rise still higher and higher among the political powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>To depend upon foreign assistance to make good our independence, which is perfectly within our own competency to achieve, would be to sacrifice a brilliant future to the present, a great and unspeakable prospective prosperity, to the momentary advantage of the present hour.
