<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Yet, from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, even its sincerest disciples longed to behold in their Master a temporal <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Nor did even this accomplish the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> There is another development of the enemy's brutality and barbarism, which ought to be placed upon record side by side with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondence, and that is the unparalleled and horrible incarceration and even defilement of churches dedicated to the worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The church at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> was a memorable example, and the evidences of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> civilization and decency in their treatment of this church, as well as others, ought to be placed in such a form that even <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mendacity could not overlook it.
