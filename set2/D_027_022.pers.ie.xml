<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> For <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> nights past the quiet on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> has been interrupted by heavy and rapid cannonading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, in particular, a fierce artillery duel took place, continuing for an hour or more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We learn that our batteries opened upon the enemy's mortar lines, and it is presumed that the fire had some effect, for on yesterday the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were perfectly docile, and desisted in a great measure from their accustomed practice of shelling the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> It was currently reported yesterday that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was again &#x0022;changing his base&#x0022; by making a movement to the <rs>North</rs> side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>; but we have been unable to learn that it has any foundation in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The only thing known with certainty is that some movement has been in progress in the enemy's camp, but the people of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> seem to be as much mystified in regard to its nature as those living at a greater distance from the scene of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is stated on what is deemed good authority that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is moving his forces on the <num value="2">two</num> rivers &mdash; the <rs>Appomattox</rs> and the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The scar city of water in the interior doubtless had something to do with this movement; but the more probable solution is that it was done for the convenience of removing the troops to any particular locality on the north side of the <rs>James</rs>, or the <rs>Chesterfield</rs> side of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, where they may be needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is no doubt true that some portion of the &#x0022;Army of the <rs>Potomac</rs>&#x0022; has crossed the river, but not in sufficient force to indicate an abandonment of the present line of operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The train last evening brought over a dozen or so <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners, who allowed their zeal to move &#x0022;on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.&#x0022; to get the better of their discretion, and thus fell into the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The news from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> is (or <hi rend="italics">are,</hi> if you choose to have the word plural) glorious, indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/><measure n="2000" type="prisoners">Two thousand prisoners</measure>, <num value="25">twenty-five</num> guns, <num value="7">seven</num> standards!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Why, this is a great victory, such as has established the reputation of many a General, and gained more than <num value="1">one</num> his <hi rend="italics">batonde Marchal.</hi> It is most auspicious, especially at this moment, in every aspect in which it is possible to view it; but it is especially so, in so far as it seems to open the way to ulterior operations, and to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of a long series of battles, which, if they turn out as we hope they will, will result in the annihilation of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Grant we are convinced, is preparing another flank movement, which is to take him out into <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName>, and this movement on his right is the premonitory symptom. --What he expects to make in <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName> we do not know, unless it is to get possession of the railroads on the <rs>Southside</rs> and thus cut us off from our communication with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>We do not think he can do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The story of his mining we do not credit, for we do not hold him to be an absolute fool, and a man must be such to think of capturing an army in the open field, drawn up in line of battle, by sapping and mining.
