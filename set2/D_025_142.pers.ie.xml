If it be so difficult to winnow the wheat from the chaff here in the army, how can a fugitive from the field, &#x0022;an intelligent officer from the front,&#x0022; or &#x0022;a reliable gentleman who came down on the cars,&#x0022; extract the truth from such a mass of falsehood and give it a consistency worthy of publication?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/><measure n="12months" type="date">Twelve months</measure> ago I was here as the correspondent of another journal, and witnessed the sad scenes attendant upon the evacuation of the town in mid-winter by its then occupying citizens, made up mainly of decrepit men, frail women, and helpless children; and never, while memory serves me, will I forget that long and dismal procession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in my life, I really feared lest <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> was a &#x0022;finished&#x0022; town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The brutal behest of an ingrate General decreed that the people must leave and the town be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The citizens of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, great as was the sacrifice, cheerfully made it, and, to their everlasting praise, it will be recorded in history that there were no womanly repining or unmanly exhibitions of regret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Indeed, <num value="1">one</num> of the best and purest of our Southern <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> told me that he did not hear even a child cry on that memorable occasion; and then how shall I speak of the fearless few of both sexes who, mid <num value="10">ten</num> mortal hours, when the enemy from <num value="175">one hundred and seventy-five</num> guns rained shot and shell on the devoted city, quailed not, but stood nobly by their homes and household gods &mdash; even to witness the destruction of their own hearths, and the sacking by an infuriate and drunken soldiery of their neighbors' homes; and their patience in exile, and the endurance of those who lived for <num value="6">six</num> weary months right under the enemy's guns?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>I have seen the people of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> under all these circumstances, when high courage and true patriotism were indeed essential, and I have yet to see the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> of them who does not rejoice in his sacrifices, and not <num value="1">one</num> of them to-day can be found who lacks faith in the final triumph of our cause.
