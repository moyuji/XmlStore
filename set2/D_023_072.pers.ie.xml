<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Their journals in this city are coming out in very remarkable articles, shaping the issue, and laboring hard to bring the whole party over to their sanitary and revolutionary views. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> of yesterday, for example, presents the bloody programme of extermination of the white race of the <rs>South</rs>, as did <persName n="Stevens,,Thaddeus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><foreName>Thaddeus</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, a short time ago, in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> From several sources it has been intimated that the <rs>Confederates</rs> are anxious to abandon the independent nationality programme, and to proclaim themselves the friends of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>It was reported a few days ago that the rebel army, under <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, upon touching the soil of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, laid aside the <name>Stars</name> and Bars, and raised the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>, and announced that they were coming to restore the <rs>Union</rs> as if was and to maintain the old Constitution, A gentleman who is reported to entertain secession proclivities, who was recently a prisoner on the other side of the line, speaks of a conversation with an officer of the rebel army, in which he was confidentially informed that the purpose of she invasion of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> was to raise the old <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>, and to call upon the people of both the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> to and the <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Richard,Henry,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName> in subverting the present Administration, and restating the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>He says that this idea was promulgated officially through the rebel army, and that its announcement revived the hopes and the spirits of the men, and filled them with more enthusiasm than had at any time before been exhibited. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> If these representations are true, it is evident that the leaders of the rebellion are convinced that their original programme is a complete failure, and like wily politicians, they are ready now to made all they have done to Cample under their own feet the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and the new flag they have attempted to introduce, and to enter the arena as an armed political organization, for the purpose of working out a revolution which they have been unaided to effect by the simple force of arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>There is reason to believe that this modification of the rebel programme is not without adhere and abettors in the <rs>North</rs>, and that there is danger that the whole character of the rebellion and the war for the <rs>Union</rs> may be completely changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The effort now seems to be to combine together all the elements of hostility, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, against the radical abolition agitators, and instead of foreign intervention, or an attempt to maintain the integrity of the so called <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, we may expect next to hear of an organized effort to bring the radicals of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> to their senses, and compel them to support the <rs>Union</rs>, instead of denouncing it, and to maintain the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in stead of trampling upon it as a covenant with bell. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/> That paper was presented on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of your present session, and was at once referred to the appropriate committee, where it has reposed, undisturbed by the fierce agitation which has seriously and unmistakably influenced your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>It has, however, at last re- appeared, but to be consigned to the <q>&#x0022;Tomb of all the <name>Capelets</name>.&#x0022;</q> I have no complaint to make of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>In truth, it is a melancholy fact, forced upon every reflecting mind, that even much graver and more vital principles are, at least, in the estimation of many of your honorable body, entombed in the vague recollections of the past. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/> When the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the sovereign rights of the <name>States</name> are engulfed in the morbid rush and wild stampede in search of antiquated relies of monarchical institutions, it would seem, perhaps, presumptuous in <num value="1">one</num> so humble as myself to expect a better fate, either for himself or his clients.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/> In the opinion which I had occasion to give on the <date value="07-08">8th July,</date> on the <name>Conscript</name> act, I used the following language: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/> &#x0022;On this subject, after the most solicitous and matured consideration, I have not a shadow of doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>I am perfectly clear and distinct in the opinion that this order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> is in direct and no <unclear>able</unclear> conflict with the law of Congress, and also that there is no power either in the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>, the <rs>President</rs>, or all combined to interpolate any act of Congress, or to revoke, modify, or extend its provisions, in the absence of such power created and bestowed by the express provisions of the law itself; or a power derived from, and distinctly traceable to, an express grant of such power in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>I have not been able to discover anywhere the grant of such a power, even by the most platitudinous implication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>I am, therefore, constrained to give it as my deliberate opinion that the order in question cannot legally direct, impair, or curtail any <num value="1">one</num> right or privilege imparted to the certain designated persons in the <name>Conscript</name> act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/> For the petition, which so quietly slept during the excited debates in your honorable body, I used this language: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/> &#x0022;There can be no question that <hi rend="italics">nil</hi> laws passed by Congress are <hi rend="italics">supreme</hi>, and challenge the <hi rend="italics">obedient acquiescence</hi> of the <rs>President</rs> and every Department of the <rs>Government</rs>, until they are repeated or pronounced unconstitutional by a competent judicial tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>And any violation of any <num value="1">one</num> or more of such laws by any Department of the <rs>Government</rs>, is not less culpable than a similar violation by any other member of society. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/> &#x0022;The reason, spirit, and intention of the law in question, as well as its words, context, and subject matter, are plain and unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>There is no point, no word, no object, no purpose, which is not fairly and plainly set forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The question then presents itself, painful, serious and viral, shall the law prevail, or shall the intervening, unauthorized interpolation of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> prevail.--Shall an army order revoke a solemn act of Congress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>Shall Congress or the <rs>Executive</rs> rule the people control the army, and legislate for the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Have we a constitutional Government, with specific powers granted, beyond which no department of the <rs>Government</rs> shall pass, or have we an unlimited Government, dependent only on Executive will or ministerial caprica!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/> &#x0022;These are no idle questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>They are solemnly propounded, and merit a solemn response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>The voice of history is not less potent in its warnings against Executive assumption or ministerial abuse of power than the hopes of the future are dependent upon your response. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/> &#x0022;In view of the dangers which beset the country, your petitioners cannot better conclude their appeal than by adopting the significant language uttered by <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, in the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, on the <date value="1788-01-07">7th January, 1788,</date> when he exclaimed: <q>&#x0022;The real rock of political salvation is self love &mdash; perpetuated from age to age &mdash; in every human breast, and manifested in every human action.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> It is needless here to restate the provisions of the act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>It is perfectly plain that the express language of the bill <hi rend="italics">included</hi> <q>&#x0022;all persons&#x0022;</q> under <num value="35">thirty-five</num> and over <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age, and as expressly <hi rend="italics">excluded</hi> <q>&#x0022;all persons&#x0022;</q> not embraced in those ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>The terms of the law are express.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Its scope, design, and purpose, are as clear as language can express any idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Whatever the language clearly expressed could not be construed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>But I need not argue this point; for, to doubt it. I should but contradict and deny the express language of the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary of War">honorable Secretary at War</rs>, in his letter to <persName n="Clark,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>My long acquaintance with, and high personal regard for, the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary of War">honorable Secretary at War</rs>, would forbid so great a rudeness, if, indeed, I were not restrained by the ordinary courtesies of life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/> It is true, the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary">honorable Secretary</rs> afterwards</hi> caused to be issued general orders <num value="44">No. 44</num> and <num value="46">46</num>, each of which ran counter to the act, and did not comport with his declarations to <persName n="Clark,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>.--But it is not for <hi rend="italics">me</hi> to compose and reconcile those discrepancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>I respectfully refer them to your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>I make no doubt that each member will discern the path of <hi rend="italics">duty,</hi> from the suggestions of inclination, and, where any conflict occurs between the <hi rend="italics">law and these orders,</hi> he will, at least, give the law its proper weight, in the scale of legislative justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>I may here remark, in anticipation of any learned objection, as well as in answer to the report of the learned committee, that <hi rend="italics"><rs n="General Order 46" type="misc">general order No. 46</rs></hi> was in plain, affirmative, authoritative contradiction to the express expositions by the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary of War">honorable Secretary at War</rs>, of the <rs>Conscript Act</rs>, as promulgated by himself <hi rend="italics">as to</hi> the <measure n="12months" type="date">12 months</measure> men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> Before dismissing this point, allow me to call your attention to the terms used in the <name>Conscript</name> act No. <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num>;</hi> for it seems your honorable body is nearly as <hi rend="italics">prolific</hi> in Conscript acts as the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary">honorable Secretary</rs> is in orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It is to be hoped you will not be <hi rend="italics">less consistent.</hi> It I am not misled by my recollection of the usual and ordinary rules of construction, it is a cardinal rule that the <name>Legislature</name> is always supposed to employ the <hi rend="italics">very best and clearest terms known to the <rs>English</rs> language</hi> to convey their meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Under this rule, may I ask, in all respect, what is the <hi rend="italics">legal import</hi> of the words <q>&#x0022;persons aforesaid,&#x0022;</q> as applied to the <num value="35">35</num> year men; and <q>&#x0022;all persons now enrolled, &#x0022;</q> &#x0026;c., as applied to those men over <num value="35">35</num> and under <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure> of age?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The distinction is not without a difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>What that <hi rend="italics">difference</hi> is I deferentially refer to the wisdom of your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>It will doubtless meet, as it merits, a clear and precise legislative exposition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/> If I am correct in the views here expressed, and distinctly thrown out in the <hi rend="italics">petition,</hi> allow me, in all respect, to call your especial attention to the provisions of Conscript act No. <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num>.</hi> By the operation of <rs n="General Order 46" type="misc">general order No. 46</rs>, as expounded by the honorable committee, all men retained in the service over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> of age, even though they be <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> of age, are kept in service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>By the <hi rend="italics">non-conforming</hi> vote of the <name>Senate</name>, all <hi rend="italics">boys,</hi> though only <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of age, are retained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>To top the climax, the bill which has passed your honorable body <hi rend="italics">requires</hi> the <hi rend="italics">States</hi> to furnish, when called on so to do by the <rs>President</rs>, every male citizen, subject to military duty, <hi rend="italics">under the age of <measure n="45years" type="date">45 years</measure>.</hi> Compute all the <hi rend="italics">boys </hi> retained by the <name>Senate</name>, and all the men over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> held by <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> No. 4d, and all the men under <measure n="45years" type="date">45 years</measure> claimed by Conscript act No. <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num>,</hi> and how many men or boys will be left?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The calculation is worthy of your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Reduced to figures, you will have drained the entire country, utterly destroyed the basis of militia organization, and well nigh depopulated the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/> When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> read Conscript act No. <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num>,</hi> it occurred to me, as a fair suggestion, that it was the design of your honorable body to <hi rend="italics">relieve,</hi> by prompt discharge, all men over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> of age, in order that each State might be in a state of preparation to meet the demands of the <rs>President</rs> for men over <num value="35">35</num> and under <measure n="45years" type="date">45 years</measure> of age. Indeed, I am not sure that this is not the design of your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>For otherwise, it must seem to every reflecting mind that it will be a most unreasonable draft on the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>To illustrate, say there is now <num value="5">five</num> per cents of the population <hi rend="italics">over</hi> <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> of age in the army that is <hi rend="italics">retained.</hi> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> calls on the <name>States</name> for a draft of <num value="0.1">10 per cent</num> of this population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Here you draw on this branch of <hi rend="italics">industry and home defence</hi> for an unjust proportion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/> But why hold on to men <hi rend="italics">over</hi> <num value="40">40</num>, now <hi rend="italics">in service?</hi> and relieve men of a similar age who are <hi rend="italics">out of it:</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/> From these views, thus crudely expressed in the hurry of pressing engagements, it occurs to my mind that the <hi rend="italics">only way to sustain, with justice, the objects of the supplemental Conscript act, is to carry out in good faith the provisions of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act.</hi> And this I respectfully ask you to do. As an honorable man I can ask nothing less. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/> I offer you my sincere apologies for thus bringing to your notice the claims of my clients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>The report of your honorable committee precludes me from any other course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The obligations of professional honor will not allow entire silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>I represent a class of men as true as they are brave, as loyal as they are patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>They only ask for their lights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>They are sternly opposed to every species of legislative or executive tyranny they are devoted to the <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> in which we are all so deeply involved, they are taught-by the blood and <unclear></unclear> of many a well fought battle that the &#x0022;jewel of liberty is even more precious than life, but to be well and worn, <hi rend="italics">it must be respected in lair as well as precious.</hi>--Those that have fallen <hi rend="italics">hoped</hi> to bequeath it to their posterity, and those that survive <hi rend="italics">claim to <unclear> </unclear> and possess it</hi> That <q>&#x0022;jewel&#x0022;</q> is &mdash; pardon the expression, I mean no offence--<hi rend="italics">States rights <unclear></unclear> in arms, and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> laws fairly administered.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/> My clients are not more interested in this matter than are the different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>For when your honorable body shall disregard the vested rights of the citizen, it is an easy and rapid step to disregard the rights of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Indeed, it is to be feared that there is not the highest regard for the <name>States</name> existing in certain quarters at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>It is to be hoped that no such sentiment prevails in the breast of any member of your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>To suggest such an idea would be to intimate the existence of a purpose as <hi rend="italics">treasonable to constitutional liberty as it is subversive of institutional freedom.</hi> The power, wherever it exists, or by whomsoever it is caught to be exercised, which strikes at the <hi rend="italics">sovereignty of the <name>States</name>,</hi> will fail of its purpose, and soon fall into hat state of mental, moral, and governmental decadence, which now hangs like a pall over the <rs>Northern</rs> mind and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>As we cherish this principle and practically elucidate it in a just regard for personal liberty and versed rights, so will we hold up a beacon light to lead back to peace, and after that, <hi rend="italics">constitutional liberty.</hi> I commit the case of my clients to your honorable body, and subscribe myself. </p> <closer> <salute>Your ob'dt serv't.</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Gilmer,,John,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="default:Gilmer,John,H.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName>  <surname>Gilmer</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <date value="1862-09-24">Sept. 24, 1862.</date> </closer> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>To entertain such an idea, implies the belief that unfavorable news has been received in official quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>We are satisfied, from our own investigations, that no such news has been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Nearly the entire force of the enemy were annihilated, the slaughter being perhaps the most terrific ever known in the same space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Many of the deluded creatures were slain in the attempt to recross the river, and it is stated that the number of dead was so great that the stream was literally dammed by their bodies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>During the previous week it will be proved and sent forward to the navy yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>The model of these guns differs considerably from that of the regular <num value="9">9</num> and <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> hindrance, and still more from the model of the <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> Columbiad or <name type="weapon">Rodman guns</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>As the iron turrets in which they will be mounted furnish but cramped fighting quarters, being, we believe, generally of <measure n="22feet" type="distance">22 feet</measure> in diameter, the guns are made very short in proportion to their calibre, being some <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> shorter than the <name>Rodman</name> <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15-inch</measure>. They are not turned from muzzle to breach, as all other guns now are, but from a line some <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> behind the trauntons to the muzzle, leaving the breach a huge unfinished mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>The arrangement of the breach for the operating tackle also differs from the regular navy pattern having no horizontal opening for receiving the hawser, and in its place a simple semi-circular projection, some <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure> in diameter, and the same in thickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The trauntons are much shorter than those of the regular navy gun, being adapted to an iron carriage.--The <q>&#x0022;water circulating core&#x0022; </q> now adopted in casting the <name>Columbiads</name>, has also been adapted to the <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> Monitor gun, all other navy guns being cast solid.
