<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> R.'s speech was not at ail discreet, and was well calculated to damage his own motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who properly estimates the sagacity and caution of the <rs>French Emperor</rs> could suppose, for instance, that he would make a grave charge of breach of ministerial and international courtesy against the <rs>British Government</rs> to a British member of Parliament, with authority, or rather request, that he would reject it on the floor of Parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He is hardly the man to do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>When he wanted to make a charge or a complaint of the kind public he would likely take some other course more consistent with his own dignity as well as with common propriety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> It is probable that, in reporting the remarks of the <rs>Emperor</rs> touching the alleged breach of courtesy of the <rs>British Government</rs> in communicating to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> his proposition touching mediation in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> allures, he gave his version of a misunderstood conversation, just as he did in stating that the <rs>Emperor</rs> said he had instructed his Envoy at <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to ask the <rs>British Government</rs> to join him in recognizing the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, when, according to the <hi rend="italics">Moniteur,</hi> he only stated that he would instruct <persName n="Gros,Baron,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Gros,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Baron">Baron</roleName> <surname>Gros</surname></persName>, the <rs>French Ambassador</rs>, to &#x0022;sound the intentions of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>&#x0022; upon this point, and to give him to understand that if the <rs>English Cabinet</rs> believed that the recognition of the <rs>South</rs> would put an end to the war <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">the Emperor</rs> would be disposed to follow it in this direction. &#x0022; A very different version, indeed! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <persName n="Roebuck,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Roebuck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roebuck</surname></persName> has obliged the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> with some very just views of its <unclear> </unclear> condition, and some warm praizes of the heroism of its people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Even Bright, the political ranter, was assisted by it to make a hit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> But after all, it makes very little difference what sort of a man makes a motion about recognition at the present time in the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName> it would most the same fate that it will probably have with <persName n="Roebuck,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Roebuck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roebuck</surname></persName> for its patron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Recognition will come when it can have little or not elect; and probably not before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We have learned to regard it with indifference, and the nations can take their time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We shall nevertheless, not forget our friends, come what will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In the meantime the evident justice of our claims to recognition continues to force the subject upon the diplomatists?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They put it aside to day and declare that it is dead and in its grave, and yet to-morrow it rises like Basque's ghost and forces itself upon their notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This will continue to be the case until the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is formally acknowledged. </p> </div3>
