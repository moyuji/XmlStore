<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> This is the heading of an article in the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The papers have stopped, calling the defeat a <q>&#x0022;masterly movement,&#x0022;</q> and are coming down to the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The following is the article. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> The series of Federal disasters in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, ending with the latest and greatest of all &mdash; the retreat of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,Packenham,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> before superior numbers &mdash; is well calculated to stir the national heart to the depths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The whole country is roused, and every body inquires what is the cause of the misfortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The blame does not rest with the brave troops who have been sacrificed, fighting like heroes, not with the <rs>General</rs>, who, at the outset, said he would do the best he could with the small number of troops entrusted to him, but with the imbecility of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> and the <rs>War Departments</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It was <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,Packenham,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s purpose to proceed up the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but over incompetent <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> was unable to clear it for him, notwithstanding the immense number of vessels at the command of <persName n="Goldsborough,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Goldsborough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Goldsborough</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/><placeName reg="The James">The James</placeName> would have been his basis of operations from the beginning, instead of the <rs>York</rs> and the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>; and, supported by the gunboats, he would have been in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> a month ago. The <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> cut up and divided <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,Packenham,,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> in despite of all his remonstrances, sending <num value="1">one</num> portion here and another there, in order to give position and consequence to political <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, while the rebels concentrated their whole force around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.--the, decisive <unclear></unclear> of the theatre of war. The result was a serious reverse to our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>If this blow had been brought about by design on the part of our high officials, it could hardly have been more disastrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>That the radicals intended to have <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,Packenham,,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> repulsed on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, as they caused <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> to be repulsed on the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>, there cannot exist a doubt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> But there is something still worse to be apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The news of the disaster has gone to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and upon its heels will probably follow intervention on the part of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, if not of all the maritime powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> The practical question is, what ought to be flow done in the crisis that is upon us. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing the people ought to do is to demand the removal of the imbeciles from the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> and <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, who have brought such disgrace upon our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The next most essential thing is to secure the coast from the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> to the <rs>Kennebec</rs>.--to strengthen the fortifications already in existence, and to add new works wherever they may be needed, and, lastly, to organize a <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guard</orgName> to man the artillery, and practice constantly at the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>In the meantime the fleet of gunboats ought to be made stronger, and the new iron-clad vessels ought to be hastened to completion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Lastly, <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> the <num value="300000">300,000</num> men called for by the <rs>President</rs> be speedily enrolled, organized, and brought into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Thus prepared for the powers disposed to intervene, they may shrink back from the consequences, or should they be rash enough to assail us, we can retaliate upon them with terrible vengeance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> Not only can we wrest from them every foot of soil on this continent, and on all the islands which belong to it, but we can carry the war into <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>There are plenty of <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> throughout the <rs>Northern States</rs> who want to go to <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> with arms in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Then, if the country is forcibly broken up by foreign interference, the loss of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> bonds, amounting to <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of dollars, due to <name>English</name> capitalists, is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>If the republic is divided it is no longer the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the question is which half of it will be responsible to foreign countries for the common debt.--Among the dangers, too, of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Powers will be revolution at home, organized by the <name>Democracy</name> in sympathy with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> Such are some of the difficulties involved in the meddling of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations with our domestic affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Yet there is too much reason to believe that they meditate intervention, and that they will attempt it if our statesmen are not careful and energetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Our people should be prepared for this emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It is extremely probable that they will make the recent disaster in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> an excuse for the recognition of the independence of the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and that step would involve consequences of the most tremendous character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Our citizens should hold a great public meeting, where the voice of the people could be heard and the conservative strength and power of this metropolis made manifest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Another article in the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> winces after this fashion: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> Tax bills, currency bills, Treasury notes, a bankrupt bill, tariff bills, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c., are coming upon us in their full force, combining depletion on a large scale, and some little relief withal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The late events near <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> indicate another years war, and an additional debt of <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> to our late calculations, to say nothing of the chances of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Let us brace ourselves up to the work; but let the <name>Administration</name> buckles to with a vigorous and united Cabinet, and the country will stand the ordeal and come out of it triumphantly. </p> </div4>
