<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It was not for some time possible to trace these rumors to any reliable source or to ascertain the exact extent to which these abuses have been carried. --A little inquiry has, however, developed the fact that, whether the reports be true or not, there is at least very strong reason to believe them so. </p> </q><bibl n="The Chicago Times"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> It is said that <persName n="Land,Colonel,,,,De" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Land,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <nameLink>De</nameLink> <surname>Land</surname></persName> has issued orders that if any prisoners shall fall to comply instantly with any requirement of a soldier belonging to the guard he shall be shot down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>This regulation may be necessary enough in its strict acceptation as requiring obedience to orders of a disciplinary character, but is exceedingly liable to abuse when the guarding soldier is made the judge of what constitutes an act of insubordination, and is permitted to revenge non- compliance with commands emanating from himself and not from the officer in command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It is charged that the abuse of this power has not been unfrequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It is said, for instance, that about <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> ago <num value="1">one</num> of the prisoners was kindling his fire, which act he had a right to perform, when <num value="1">one</num> of the guard accosted him with, &#x0022;Here, what are you doing there? &#x0022; The prisoner replied, &#x0022;That is not your business,&#x0022; when the guard instantly drew his musket and shot the fellow dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It is said also, that a mulatto boy, a servant of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Confederate</rs> captains, and, of course, a prisoner of war, who was well known to have a pass to go anywhere within the lines, was walking inside the guard limits about a day after the above occurrence, when the guard commanded him to halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>He did not stop, and was instantly killed by a bullet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> It is also charged that, at the time the discovery was made of an attempt on the part of some of the prisoners to escape, a party of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num> was huddled together and surrounded by a guard; that <num value="1">one</num> of them was pushed by a comrade and fell to the ground, and that instantly the unfortunate man was shot, and that <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> others were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It is further stated that it is no uncommon things for a soldier to fire on the barracks without any provocation whatever, and that <num value="2">two</num> men were thus shot while sleeping in their bunks a week or <num value="2">two</num> ago, no inquiry being made into the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>No court-martial has been held, no arrest has been made though within the past month <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> of the prisoners have been thus put out of the way. Another instance need only be given: <num value="1">One</num> of the prisoners asked the guard for a chew of tobacco, and he received the bayonet in his breast without a word. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> If the above reports are true, a reform might be instantly instituted.

<head>A word for <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> The bill of <persName n="Miles,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Miles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName>, to which we alluded <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, is understood, and we believe has been expressly avowed, to be intended for the benefit of the <name>Marylanders</name> of age to bear arms residing among us. In the course of the discussion hard things have been said of Marylanders in general, without, we think, sufficient cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>There are, it is true, among us many persons from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> who were the curse of that great city as long as they remained in it, and who will always be the curse of any city in which, for the time, they may happen to take up their residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Yet it does seem to us very hard that the name of a whole State should suffer from the acts of a handful of desperadoes who may happen to have been born within its limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Let us make the case our own. Suppose some extraordinary convulsion should banish the whole body of our own native-born rowdies &mdash; and we have enough of them Heaven knows &mdash; to some city south of us &mdash; <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, for instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Suppose they should practice there the arts they have learned here until the whole population rose up against them as <num value="1">one</num> man.--Would we not think it hard that old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should be stigmatized for the acts of these her degenerate children &mdash; children whom she would scorn to own, and of whose deeds she would be deeply ashamed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>There is no <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> who would not protest against any judgment found against his State upon testimony such as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Yet this is precisely the testimony upon which <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> has been judged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The Plug Ugly and the <rs>Blood Tub</rs> are taken as types of that race from whom sprang <persName n="Howard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Howard,Ro,,,:1"><surname>Howard</surname></persName>, <persName n="Williams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><surname>Williams</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Smith,nomatch:0"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, in the war of the old Revolution &mdash; whose fathers fought by the side of ours at <placeName reg="Guilford, New Haven, Connecticut" key="tgn,2016959">Guilford</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Camden, Kershaw, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095449">Camden</placeName>, at <num value="96">Ninety Six</num>, and at <placeName key="tgn,7014152" n="1.000 7" reg="eutaw, greene, alabama">Eutaw</placeName> &mdash; whose institutions are the same with our own, and of whose sons many have laid down their lives since this war began, fighting in this cause, which is theirs as well as ours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> When the conscript law was on its passage in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the most prominent among the <name>Marylanders</name> who resided among as desired its provisions to embrace all citizens of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> residing in any of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>These views were presented to different members of Congress by citizens of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and the evils which would follow any exemption of their countrymen were at the same time clearly pointed out. They did not, however, impress the minds of the members so deeply as to produce any modification of the law, and the <name>Marylanders</name> were left out. This fact is stated by a writer in the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer,</hi> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, and was well known before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The useful class of Marylanders feared the very thing which has happened, and so expressed themselves &mdash; namely, that the vicious class of their countrymen finding that they were not liable to conscription, would congregate here in large numbers, and by their vices excite prejudices against all Marylanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The better class of them are at this moment all in favor of extending the conscription to <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> But why should congressional invective be reserved for <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> alone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Are Marylanders the only men who neglect their duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Is there no neglect of duty in Congress itself at this moment, when the enemy is stirring heaven and earth against us?--What have they done, that members should be so ready to hurl their anathemas against <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> as the only sinner?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The law requires that an accuser should go into court with clean hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Hold up your hands, gentlemen of both Houses!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Outside of Congress &mdash; in the army and among the people &mdash; are there none who neglect duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Where were the balance of the <num value="110000">110,000</num> men on <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s muster roll when he fought the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs> with less than <num value="40000">40,000</num>?--Where were the <num value="100000">100,000</num> that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> ought to have had when he fought the <rs n="Battle of Sharpsburg" type="battle">battle of Sharpsburg</rs> with but <num value="35000">35,000</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Where are the stragglers and deserters who swarm in the mountains and infest the lower country like locusts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Depend upon it, if the <name>Marylanders</name> have sinned deeply they have sinned at least in company. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> It is evident to every man who will take the trouble to think, that those Marylanders who are among us are as deeply interested in the success of our cause as we can possibly be. They can never go back to their State unless as victors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They must set up their homes in the <rs>South</rs> or they can live nowhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Whatever fate may befall us must be their fate also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>In the meantime they have sent us many brave soldiers &mdash; men who have fought as well as any in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The mechanics of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> form so large a body that if they fall under the conscription we understand some of the <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName> will be stopped entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We hope at least some caution will be observed in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>We hope, moreover, that if it is determined to conscribe these men. Congressmen will at least cease to use to wards them and their State that flippant, jeering style of invective which can only irritate, and cannot answer any good purpose. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It would be difficult to find a white man of any prominence in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of inferior capacity for the administration of Government to the <rs>Illinois</rs> rail-splitter, or whose personal deportment and manners would be as unbecoming high station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Now, the truth is, <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> never looked upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in its best days as anything but a land of adventurers, never regarded it as more than half-civilized, never concerned itself about it except for its agricultural productions &mdash; its cotton, rice and tobacco.
