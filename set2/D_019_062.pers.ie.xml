<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>After an allusion to his physical disabilities, he preceeded to allude to the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propossitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He read an amendment which he had offered in the <name>Conference</name>, relative to the appointment of Territorial officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He sought in this to guard the interests of the <rs>South</rs>, and to secure the appointment of trustworthy agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>he could not account for the vastly increased expenditures of Government within the last <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure>, since he left the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A system of plunder had grown up in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, which he sought to restrain by his amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The whole <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> delegation voted for it, yet it only received those <num value="5">five</num> votes, plain and rational as it was. He would that it could be incorporated now upon any programme that is designed to be offered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> He then proceeded to consider the remaining sections, which he did not reach yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He related an anecdote of the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to show that Southern people were best capable of managing their own affairs, and quoted a provision of that instrument, made in favor of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, touching representation and taxation, giving in addition, decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> thereupon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> To the <orgName type="regiment" key="4Section">fourth section</orgName> he had no objection, because it merely reaffirms the language of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Against the <orgName type="regiment" key="5Section">fifth section</orgName>, relative to the foreign slave trade, (and for which his friend from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName> had made the best apology that could be made,) the <rs>Virginia</rs> delegation voted as a unit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He had no desire to re-open the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade; he protested against it. But they looked upon it as applicable to event of a recognition of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>To the <orgName type="regiment" key="6Section">sixth section</orgName> there was nothing objectionable.--The last section was looked upon as the mitigation of forced emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The chief objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>however, was to the latter clause, securing to citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens of other States. --The Constitution already provided for that, and this enactment would give Congress an opportunity to legislate upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In Northern States, <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> among others, movements were on foot to secure to negroes the rights of citizenship, and he supposed the case of a Southern <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> sitting cheek-by-jow!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The section was voted against unanimously by the <rs>Virginia</rs> delegation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In fact, the propositions offered nothing of a tangible character, while they omitted all that would be rosily for the security of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They gave no guarantees for the recovery of fugitives &mdash; no security against the operations of the <orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">underground railroad</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> He alluded to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s proposition for a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>, which he illustrated by the couplet of the spider and the fly. If <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> got into such a Convention, she would never get out again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It would not do for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to told her arms in slumber &mdash; she must do something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The probable evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was here touched upon, and he spoke of his efforts with <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He thought the proceeding commendable in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, even though the necessity was forced upon him. He wished that the same policy might be pursued in regard to <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>, and that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> might be recognized, in order to save the fragments of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But events portended that something else was in contemplation, and it would not do for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to rest idly under a delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>All eyes were now turned towards her. If chicanery or cajolery were practiced, it would be well for her to look to it with suspicion; if it were found necessary to increase the garrison at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, it would be well for her to look to it, and prepare for any emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The numerous resignations in the army meant something.--They would not disclose the secrets of the army, but it was apparent that movements were contemplated in which they could take no part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> must have guarantees for protection against the aggressive power which had grown up in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Majorities are despotic &mdash; he had rather be governed by <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:King,Horatio,,,:1"><surname>King</surname></persName> <num value="1">One</num> than <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Numbers</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was disposed to try further experiments, let her go forth strong-handed, and without timidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Let her yield not an inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He wanted the <rs>Government</rs> of the whole Union, and believed we could acquire it if we pursued a sound policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>A voice was heard from N. Y. last night declaring that Va. held the destinies of the whole Union [He alluded to <persName n="Cochrane,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Cochrane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cochrane</surname></persName>.] By pursuing a decided, straightforward policy, the majority of the whole people would rally to her, and then the sceptre becomes theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He wanted the <rs>Convention</rs> to take sufficient time, and complete the work thoroughly, but not to be too slow, for the people were moving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Let <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> act for herself &mdash; let her name her ultimatum &mdash; demand ample and full protection &mdash; and send it to the <name>Border</name> slave States, and to all the free States, telling them that if they cannot adopt the course proposed, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> cannot stay with them.--He had no tears of a division of sentiment between Eastern and <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It was in the <rs>West</rs> that the men of former days stood and battled for their rights of domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>and the patriotic motive existed there still. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> He alluded to the policy of the <name>Administration</name> as having been put forth insidiously to entrap the border slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The foreign appointments were sufficient to show the course of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/><persName n="Clay,,Cassins,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Clay,Cassins,M.,,"><foreName>Cassins</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> goes to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> &mdash; a perfect fanatic on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> would not be acquired by the <rs>South</rs> under this Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The appointment of <persName n="Corwin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Corwin,Warren,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Corwin</surname></persName>, to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, was better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He expressed a high personal regard for that gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But at the <rs>Courts</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> this Government would be represented by men of <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName> associations, who would go to preach tyrannies against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Was <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, then, to slink about in the possible hope of obtaining terms to remain in the <rs>Northern Confederacy</rs>, or was she to boldly stand up for her rights, and demand security for her rights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He alluded in eloquent terms to the records of the past, preserved upon the tombstones at <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName> and at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and appealed to the <rs>Convention</rs>, in the name of the illustrious men of former days, to take a position admitting of no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He urged them to make the ultimatum strong &mdash; to say to the <rs>North</rs>, in the language of <placeName key="tgn,2082957" n="1.000 10" reg="Canute, Washita, Oklahoma">Canute</placeName> to the waters of the great deep, <q>&#x0022;Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.&#x0022;</q> Tell them that the <hi rend="italics">statu quo</hi> must be preserved as it is &mdash; that not another man must be sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, or to the fort on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Alluding to a scurrilous attack upon him in the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">N. Y. <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, where he was branded as a traitor, he said he had engaged in no political man ring with any party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The gentleman from <placeName reg="Marion, Smyth, Virginia" key="tgn,2112906">Marion</placeName> said there was no danger of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>And do we not know that the eyes of <num value="1000">thousands</num> who would resort to force, if they thought force could succeed, are turned anxiously towards <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to catch the slightest gleam that her course might afford to justify the inference that she would submit to such a policy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>He did not share the doubt that had been thrown out, that the <rs>Convention</rs> would fall short of that mark.--He believed they would stand fully and firmly on all that was demanded by the rights, the interests, and honor of the <rs>State</rs>.
