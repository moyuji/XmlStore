<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>They tell all that it is their duty thus to go, and if such persuasion fails they readily resort to the old Prussian argument, (the bayonet,) which generally convinces all refractory citizens that there must be an earnestness, if not a desperateness, in the &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Call for Volunteers.</hi>&#x0022; They say that volunteers are needed, and so, when the people themselves cease to volunteer, Secession minions will save them the trouble and write their names for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>That the proceeding is irregular and unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He took the ground that no man has a right to purge the conscience of another, unless in some suit in which he is called as a witness, or in some proceeding in which as a party he is bound to answer; or in answer to the call of the sovereign by the oath of allegiance or the oath of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The oath of office, the oath of allegiance, the obligation of testifying to the truth in a court of justice between parties litigant, are acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We were never famous for our opposition to authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>But the obedience to this writ, which requires a general discovery of alien enemies and all the information in the power of the party summoned for the purpose of discovering what property of alien enemies may be come at, I deny to answer and refuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>And the reason of this refusal is simple, although it seems to surprise some; but, as <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName> says, I was born free, and will not forfeit that freedom which I inherit from my free mother.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Some held that the authority of each came from the people, that there was a divided sovereignty, and each in its sphere supreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were limited by a grant jealously phrased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The old Constitution set forth that it was the work of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The present recites that the deputies of sovereign States had framed it. There was a grant of authority to execute all powers necessary to a General Government in the former chart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In the present, it read to execute all power <hi rend="italics">expressly</hi> granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Now, could it be said that the war power included sequestration? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> This was untrue, <persName n="Petigru,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Petigru,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Petigru</surname></persName> argued, from the language of treaties and the legislative construction given by acts of the revolutionary Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>This latter was authority, unless it were claimed that we were wiser than those historical men. The very nature of language forbade the idea of sequestration being a term applicable to captures on land and sea. Debt was an idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He had heard the learned counsel for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> say that debts could be captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>That was only poetical license.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Government would scarcely claim to administer law by a metaphor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>If she fails to avail herself of this golden opportunity, it is because her statesmen are incompetent to the guardianship of her affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We do not believe that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The dullest perception cannot fall to see that the commercial, navigation, and manufacturing interests of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> must all be placed beyond the reach of human rivalry by the success of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Nor is this all. The <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName></hi> doctrine will no longer interpose even a nominal barrier to the progress of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> colonization on this continent, and the colonies which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> already possesses will no longer be in danger of absorption by the mammoth Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The influence of radical principles, which, with every year of the progress of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, must continue to grow until it gradually undermines existing institutions in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will not only be checked but annihilated by the overthrow of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The only considerations which can be adduced in opposition to giving <q>&#x0022;aid and comfort&#x0022;</q> to the <rs>South</rs>, are the abolition sentiments of <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName>, the fear that <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> may be invaded, and, what the <rs>North</rs> has threatened, that <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of <name>British</name> property within its borders will be confiscated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName>, however, has not yet become such a power in the <rs>British</rs> empire as to influence its policy where pounds, shillings, and pence are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Moreover, it is not sufficiently assured of the purposes of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in this war to give that active sympathy which it always yields to impracticable and destructive measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>If the war is <num value="1">one</num> simply to put down what the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> has styled an insurrection of Southern planters against their commercial masters in the <rs>North</rs>, <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName>, of course, feels no interest in such a strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>When we consider the enormous war debt which the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> Government is running up, with no earthly prospect of ever paying the interest upon it, except by obtaining command of the cotton crops of the <rs>South</rs>, <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName> may well conclude that the public creditors of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have not advanced their money upon the theory that an institution which is essential to the cultivation of cotton shall be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>It is therefore idle to suppose that the pseudo philanthropy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> will be stimulated to any special paroxysm in be half of such a cause; nor if it could, has it ever yet been able to control the policy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in any point affecting her commercial interests and national power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The security of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> is of course a subject which no <name>British</name> ministry could overlook and doubtless affords a reason for the caution which that Government has exercised upon the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The colonial possessions of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> on this continent are nearly as great as the territory of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and have been constantly increasing in wealth and importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/><placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, in proportion to her population, is a more profitable customer of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and large amounts of <name>British</name> capital have been invested in <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName> and private enterprises in that growing portion of the <rs>British Empire</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The Government has sided in the construction of magnificent improvements, of railroads, canals, and bridges, which are intended to develop the vast resources of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, and to enable her to compete in trade and prosperity with her <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canadian</placeName> people, always among the most loyal of <name>British</name> colonists, have become more than ever attached to their institutions since the disruption of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>They point with pride and confidence to the solidity and safety of their own Government, to the permanent security of property and life, and to its vast superiority, even on the score of civil and political freedom, to the lawless military despotism which has triumphed over the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>We cannot of course expect that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should abandon such a colony to the risk of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invasion, which has been openly menaced by the profligate and shameless journals of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>We must give her time to put <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> in a state of defence before she assumes a position that must bring her in direct collision with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>This she is doing as rapidly as possible, both in the construction of fortifications, and in such large reinforcements of men as to excite the jealous outcries of the <rs>Northern</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It is only for the <rs>South</rs> to hold its own a little while longer, and we shall be in close alliance with the most powerful empire of modern times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> The Northern menace, in the event of <name>British</name> recognition of Southern independence, to confiscate the <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of <name>British</name> property in the <rs>North</rs>, is a mere <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">brutum fulmen,</foreign> </hi> which the <rs>British Government</rs> will know how to value as it deserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>If, as the <rs>Northern</rs> press allege, the control of Southern commerce is worth the expenditure of <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> a year for a series of years, the same <rs>Golconda</rs> would be purchased even more cheaply by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> if the <rs>North</rs> should confiscate every dollar of her property within her borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>But the <rs>North</rs> would never venture on such a step, with the prospect of having all its cities on the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs> knocked about its ears by <name>British</name> squadrons in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> after the decree of confiscation should go forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Northing is more absurd than the gasconading threats of the <rs>Northern</rs> press against <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>What could the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> do in the event of a war with that country ? Privateering she has herself denounced as piracy, and at this moment has our Southern privateers in prison cells, about to try them for their lives on that charge.--he successes of the last war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> florid no standard by which to estimate the results of another conflict with that gigantic power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> went to war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> when <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was at war with all the rest of the world, and, besides, was herself united when she ventured upon that hazardous enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/> &#x0022;About an hour after sunrise the fog cleared a day, and revealed to us several <num value="100">hundred</num> of the enemy on drill.

The next minute the captain of the battery, in a stern voice, gave the command, &#x0027;Battery, fire!&#x0027; and the <num value="6">six</num> pieces vomited forth their leaden missiles, whereupon, instead of returning our fire, the enemy immediately broke ranks and ran in the utmost confusion, up a hill, where they were concealed from our view by a dense growth of woods, from which they fired at us several rifle shots, without effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>You never saw such scampering in your life; it was truly laughable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>We fired <num value="156">156</num> shot at the house, and struck it a great number of times; <num value="24">24</num> red hot shot went to the mark, and twice we set it on fire slightly, but the fire went out.--We distinctly saw them carry off <measure n="2" type="dead">two dead</measure>; how many more were killed, we do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>We then marched to another point about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles distant</measure>, when they fired several rifle shell at us, but again without effect. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/> Thus we may calculate that <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> at least, a fortnight, or probably more, would elapse before their force could attempt a movement of advance, and when they did advance it would be to experience signal reverses at every point and final defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The rifled cannon of our artillery would be plunging shot into their camp, and our skirmishers would cut off every scout endeavoring to spy out the roads to the <rs type="place">Gulf city</rs> and the positions of its defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors of the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>:</hi>--In a recent number of your paper you refer to the fact <q>&#x0022;that from <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> to <num value="400">four hundred</num></hi> car-loads of clothing, &#x0026;c., have accumulated at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> and <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/> The disloyalty of many of her citizens has thrown discredit upon the whole of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, and such statements as the <num value="1">one</num> referred to, unexplained, are calculated to create the impression that those in control of the railroads are seeking to embarrass the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, by stopping the army supplies without excuse or justification. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/> We have no excuse or apology to offer for those born on Southern soil, who are arrayed against the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>But it is wrong to confound the innocent with the guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>While many East Tennesseeans have forgotten the allegiance they own to the land of their birth and adoption, there is in that section as true and gallant a band of patriots as are to be found in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and among the latter are the responsible heads of the railroad companies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> Our object, however, is to present facts to the public, through the columns of your paper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> There are <num value="2">two</num> railroads in <orgName type="regiment" n="EastTN1">East Tennessee 1st</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The <name>East</name> <orgName n="Tennessee and Virginia Railroad" type="railroad">Tennessee and Virginia railroad</orgName>, which is <measure n="130miles" type="distance">130 miles</measure> in length, and extends from <placeName reg="Bristol, Bristol, England" key="tgn,7011198">Bristol</placeName> to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> The <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and <orgName n="Georgia Railroad" type="railroad">Georgia railroad</orgName>, which is <measure n="110miles" type="distance">110 miles</measure> in length, and extends from <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton, Ga.</placeName> These are separate and distinct roads, owned by different stockholders, and controlled by different officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Neither <num value="1">one</num> has any control over the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The delay in the transportation of freight was caused by the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named</hi> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of this road, <persName n="Branner,Colonel,John,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00260" reg="default:Branner,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Branner</surname></persName>, is an energetic business man, and a true friend to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>It has never, however, been a <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class</hi> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Owing to the limited amount of stock subscribed, the greatest economy had to be practiced in its original construction and equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>With this economy the road, when completed, was burdened with a heavy floating debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Up to the <date value="01-01">1st of January</date> last, the income was not more than sufficient to meet the current expenses and pay the annual interest on its debt; therefore but little money could be expended in improving the road and procuring rolling stock. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/> As is well known, this route was selected last spring, over which troops and supplies were to be transported for the army in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>This road was illy prepared to meet the pressing demand made upon it; but, through the indefatigable and almost superhuman efforts of its president, it met the public requirements until the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>In the early part of that month, <persName n="Branner,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00261" reg="nearbymention:Branner,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Branner</surname></persName> was prostrated on a bed of sickness, and could, give no attention to the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>During the month, the business largely increased, several serious accidents occurred, destroying several cars and locomotives, and, to add to the embarrassment, the superintendent resigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Thus was the road left without <hi rend="italics">active officers,</hi> or a sufficiency of motive power, and was forced to suspend operations about the <date value="09- 01">first of September</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>This suspension continued about <num value="1">one</num> week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>During that period the <q>&#x0022;accumulation of freight&#x0022;</q> referred to occurred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/> <date value="09-07">On the 7th of September,</date> the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> took possession of the road, and made a requisition upon <persName n="Wallace,Major,C.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="default:Wallace,C.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and <orgName n="Georgia Railroad" type="railroad">Georgia railroad</orgName>, to work the same, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The position was unsought by <persName n="Wallace,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="nearbymention:Wallace,C.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName>; but, with that self-sacrificing devotion he has ever exhibited in the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, he accepted the responsible trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>There was great wisdom manifested in his selection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>It is no disparagement to others to state, that he is <num value="1">one</num> of the best railroad officers in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>All who have witnessed his efforts, friends or foes, will bear testimony to the fact that he has faithfully discharged his duty in the present crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>All of the employees on his road are men of the right stamp and well suited for the positions they respectively hold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/> He was fully impressed with the importance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> of keeping that line of railway open, and prepared for efficient service; also, that all its officers and employees should be prompt, careful, faithful, indefatigable, and untiring in their efforts to transport, with the greatest possible dispatch, all troops, munitions of war, and army supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>The fact that his road has promptly met every demand made upon it, and that <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> troops have passed over it without the slightest accident to a single individual, which can be traced to the neglect or misconduct of any of the operatives of his company, affords the strongest evidence that can be presented of his fidelity and efficiency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/> To add to the embarrassment which met him at the threshold in entering upon the discharge of his new duties, his superintendent, upon whom he greatly relied, met with a serious accident, which deprived <persName n="Wallace,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00264" reg="nearbymention:Wallace,C.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName> of his valuable services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Notwithstanding these difficulties, he not only succeeded in promptly removing all the detained freight, but met the daily demands, and transported a large number of troops, horses, and artillery for the army in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.-- He removed the inefficient, and placed new and efficient men in the machine and car shops of the E. T. and Va. road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>He has succeeded in obtaining the services of <persName n="Lewls,Doctor,John,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00265" reg="default:Lewls,John,W.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Lewls</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, as permanent superintendent of that road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>He purchased <num value="6">six</num> good locomotives and <num value="35">thirty-five</num> cars, and has made arrangements for from <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="40">forty</num> more cars to put on that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>He will be able to surrender the road to <persName n="Branner,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="nearbymention:Branner,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Branner</surname></persName>, on his restoration to health, in good working order, and fully prepared to performing share of duty as <num value="1">one</num> of the links in this important railway line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/> While, from the causes stated, there was an unavoidable <q>&#x0022;accumulation of freight at <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> it is not true that soldiers' clothing had been detained. --<persName n="Wallace,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="nearbymention:Wallace,C.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName>, notwithstanding the more than double labor imposed on him, made it his special business to see that soldiers' clothing, blankets, shoes, guns, and ammunition went forward between <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bristol, Sullivan, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098111">Bristol</placeName> without delay, the truthfulness of which will be attested by all who passed over those roads in charge of these articles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/> This statement of facts is made as a simple act of justice to those who are likely to suffer by the wrongs of others. </p>
