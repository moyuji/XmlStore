<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The patriarch <rs>Abraham</rs> was a model of all these qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>His reception of the strangers who visited his tent has been justly characterized as a &#x0022;specimen of a genuine gentleman; courtesy of external deportment; courtesy of polite language; courtesy of substantial hospitality; and all this the offspring of a truly benevolent heart.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The patriarch <rs>Abraham</rs> did not get other men to do his fighting for him. When he heard that war was made upon his brother, and that he was taken prisoner and his goods captured, the patriarch armed his own servants, and himself went after the enemy, fought them gallantly like the fine old hero that he was, routed them completely, and rescued his brother and his goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He considers slavery a great sin, and slaveholders children of the devil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The patriarch <rs>Abraham</rs>, on the contrary, was himself a slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The Scriptures inform us that he had slaves, bought with his own money and born in his own house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Others he received as presents from the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>His whole encampment was made up of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We may judge of the number when he could arm &#x0022;<num value="318">three hundred and eighteen</num> trained servants, born in his house,&#x0022; for the purposes of war.
