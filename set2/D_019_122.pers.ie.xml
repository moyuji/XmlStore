<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>This will soon remove the blockade from our ports, and the increase of price will amply reward you for the loss you may sustain while you keep your cotton on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>I appeal to our capitalists to go to work vigorously and prepare to manufacture such artistes as we most need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>I also appeal to our planters to redouble their energies for the production of all the supplies <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> of provisions necessary to support our people at home and our armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>We presume that Congress was, of course, influenced by no other consideration than that of the public good in the action thus had, though we are unable to appreciate fully the reasons that prompted it. We hope, however, that the removal may not prove detrimental in the least to the public interests; and that, being nearer the border which promises to be the seat of war. <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the border States of the <rs>Union</rs> may derive fresh encouragement and renewed determination from the presence and proceedings of the <rs>President</rs> and Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> We understand that the act authorizing the removal appropriates <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">$10,000</measure> to defray the expense, and provides for selling the unexpired lease of the <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>&#x0022;</q> and Department buildings at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>This would seem to indicate that the question of removal will not be agitated again until the <rs>Capital</rs> is located permanently, which, we suppose, will be referred to the next Congress to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Whether these predictions were given from calculations made by themselves, or whether they acquired their knowledge elsewhere, I forget, but the time at which the eclipse was to take place was always presented from some source or other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>These Brahmins, from the influence they had acquired over the king a mind by their proficiency in his favorite study, had become objects of general envy, and it broke out fiercely at this time, the malcontents taking their stand incantational on very slippery ground.--They aspired to a short-lived victory by denying the correctness of their opponents' prediction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Many of the chief courtiers joined the cabal from mere hatred to the <name>Brahmins</name>, without the slightest knowledge of the question, or dread of the consequences.
