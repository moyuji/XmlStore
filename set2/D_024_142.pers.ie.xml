<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The war should cease because it should never have commenced, in as much as there is no coercive military power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs> as against the <name>States</name>, which are sovereign, and in possession of all power not delegated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>If power of coercion exist at all, it is legal, not military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2">2</num>. Because there was no necessity for it. An amicable adjustment of the questions in dispute could have been, and can be still, procured on terms of fairness and equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3">3</num>. Because, however legal and just at the commencement, it has been diverted from its ostensible original purpose, and made a war for the abolition of slavery and the extinguishment of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, as such, which, of course as a consequence, subverts the <rs>Government</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/></item> 
<item n="4"> <num value="4">4</num>. Because it is made a pretext for the most outrageous and damnable crimes against the liberty of the citizen, the rights of property, and even against the form of Government under which we have lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/></item> 
<item n="5"> <num value="5">5</num>. Because it is creating a stupendous public money debt, which must bear down labor, destroy capital, and finally cause national bankruptcy and dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/></item> 
<item n="6"> <num value="6">6</num>. Because in the military it is establishing a new and dangerous power, which already overrides the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and which history teaches when once firmly established becomes permanent, despotic, and tyrannical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>When military law subverts the civil law, liberty departs forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/></item> 
<item n="7"> <num value="7">7</num>. Because there is neither in the civil nor in the military departments of Government any man or men of sufficient mental power to successfully prosecute the war against the vastly superior statesmen and <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/></item> 
<item n="8"> <num value="8">8</num>. Because the commercial wealth of the country, derived from foreign trade, and largely enhanced by Southern products, must gradually disappear if this war continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>As yet artificial stimulants have supplied the defection of sound mercantile resources, but time must dissipate them, and then will follow a reaction terrible &mdash; overwhelming and annihilating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/></item> 
<item n="9"> <num value="9">9</num>. Because the popular enthusiasm necessary to conduct the war and supply the failing armies has subsided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Force, by a draft, cannot supply the indispensable requisite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/><rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>; who have grown up with the idea of personal freedom, and right to political opinions and action, cannot be so suddenly changed as to become willing instruments of power, and be used effectually against their own convictions of policy and right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/></item> 
<item n="10"> <num value="10">10</num>. And, finally, because experience should admonish us. that the over-ruling power of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is against us. We cannot succeed in what we have undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Hence every dollar expended is thrown away &mdash; every life lost is little less than murder &mdash; every acre of land laid waste is so much toward national impoverishment &mdash; and every day's continuance of war places an additional barrier between us and reunion, and drives another nail in the coffin of the <rs>Republic</rs>.
