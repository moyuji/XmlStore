<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Gentlemen, before an <orgName n="Virginia Assembly" type="assembly">Assembly of Virginia</orgName> gentlemen I will be pardoned for saying a word of <num value="1">one</num> of those men of history whom the present rarely comprehends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><num value="1">One</num> who is daily making or moulding events which shall never die. I refer to the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We know him now better than we did. He came into our midst personally a stranger to us. He was said to be <num value="1">one</num> who, stern, resolved and self-reliant, shunned counsel, and though true and honest in intent, was, perhaps, prejudiced and obstinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>He tolled steadily on in the duties of his high office, and into the shadows which surrounded him the popular eye could not penetrate Success, the test of administrative, ability, sometimes rewarded his tolls &mdash; disaster, the unpardonable sin of statesmanship, often confounded his councils, and brought the country to the verge of doubt and despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I confess, gentlemen, the profoundest sympathy with this historic man in his hidden tolls and cares and heavy responsibilities, laboring on thus night and day for his country's good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>And when an occasional lifting of the curtain has enable us to perceive &#x0022;the very pulse of the machine&#x0022;-- the heart, and will, and mind, and purpose &mdash; which animate the man traits of noble patriotism and heroic firmness, of lofty truthfulness and chivalry, and of unsullied purity and trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, have given joy to the popular heart and confidence to the mind of the country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Our people trust in him; our women revere and honor him; our armies every where would die for him; <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> esteems and appreciates him, and posterity will exalt him to the true position he is destined to fill as <num value="1">one</num> of the great men of this age. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> We have hope gentlemen in our public men, in our public measures in our army and in our cause &mdash; in such men as our <rs type="role2">President</rs> and the leaders of our gallant, armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I had intended gentlemen, to have spoken of the measures adopted by Congress and yourselves for the public good, but at this late hour, and wearied as we all are by protracted labors, I must forbear. </p>

He recommends a vigorous State policy on the questions of relief to soldiers' families, cotton planting, Illegal distillation, impressments of provisions, removal of slaves, and desertion from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The following is a synopses of his remarks on general subjects: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> He commences by saying that the late action of Congress has shaken the confidence of the people in their justice or competency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>In our financial affairs the compulsory funding of <num value="700000000">seven hundred million</num> in <measure n="40days" type="date">forty days</measure> at a loss rate of interest than that pledged on full notes, resembles repudiation and bad faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The discussion of important measures in secret sessions is declared a blighting curse, convenient for canvassing what will not bear the light.--He declares the new military bill unconstitutional, and says the conscription of citizens will not fill the army but they will stay at home on details, thus depriving the <rs>State</rs> of her active militia, and placing civil rights subordinate to the military power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Thesus pension of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> under pretended necessity, confers upon the <rs>President</rs> powers denied by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which limited the power of Congress to suspend the action of the writ only in an implied and limited way by expressed declarations in favor of personal liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The Congress cannot center judicial powers upon the <rs>Executive</rs>, and that warrants issued by the <rs>President</rs> are plain violations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and if this act is acquiesced in the <rs>President</rs> may imprison whom he chooses &mdash; It being only necessary to allege treasonable efforts &mdash; and no Court dare investigate the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The Legislature is earnestly recommended to take prompt action to stamp the act with the seal of their indignant rebuke. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The Governor reviews the causes of the war; expressed his opinion, as to who is responsible for it, and how peace should be sought; and occupies half the message in showing its unchristian character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The Northern <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs> and moderate <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> he exonerated from causing it, and says the responsibility rests exclusively with the wicked <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, who denied the compact of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, declared an antislavery Bible and an antislavery <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. --When these obtained possession of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> the <rs>South</rs> was compelled, in self-defence, to sever the compact of sovereign States, which wicked men promised to restore by the paradox &mdash; force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Under this pretence <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> was trampled under foot, the ballot box overawed, armies raised to hold the <rs>North</rs> and subject the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>A change of Administration in the <rs>North</rs> must come before we can have peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Revolution defends the right of State sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Self-government did not provoke war, and an amicable adjustment has been refused. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has declared that <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and other States are in rebellion to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, the creature of the <name>States</name>, which they could destroy as well as create.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>In authorizing war he did not seek to restore the <rs>Union</rs> under the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it was, by confining the <rs>Government</rs> to a sphere of limited powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They have taken <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> negroes, which cost half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of whites <num value="4000">four thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars, and now seek to repudiate self-government &mdash; subjugate Southern people and confiscate their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The statement of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, that we offer no terms of adjustment, is made an artful pretext that it is impossible to say when the war will terminate, but that negotiation, not the sword, will finally terminate it. We should keep before the <rs>Northern</rs> people the idea that we are ready to negotiate when they are ready and will recognize our right to self-government and the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>After each victory our Government should make a distinct offer of peace on these terms and should the course of any State be doubted let the armed force be withdrawn and the ballet box decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>If this is refused even a dozen times, renew it and keep before the <rs>North</rs> and the world that our ability to defend ourselves for many years has been proved.--Should <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> boast of his numerical superiority, let him be reminded of the reply of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName> to Benhadad--&#x0022;Let not him that girdeth on harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.&#x0022; </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> In reply to some questions put to him by the <rs>Earl</rs> of <persName n="Derby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Derby,nomatch:0"><surname>Derby</surname></persName>, in the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>, on the <date value="02-15">15th of February,</date> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> is reported to have said that, in the affair of the rams he acted from a sense of duty, and from no extraneous influence, <hi rend="italics">believing</hi> that the rams were intended to be used for the purpose of carrying on war with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>From this, it is evident that he considers it his duty to assist the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in every way short of a declaration of war, and to thwart the <rs>Confederates</rs> in every way short of actual hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>If he believes that the rams are designed to be used against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, he knows that the cannon, small arms, and munitions of war, which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> obtain in vast quantities from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, are designed to be used in making war upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>His idea of a strict neutrality, then, is to throw open at the resources of the <rs>British</rs> empire to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and to keep them closed against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> may be injured to the greatest extent possible by means furnished by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, for that is legitimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must suffer no damage from any permission given to the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It is perfectly legitimate for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to build ships at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> to capture the <rs>Alabama</rs>; but should the <rs>Confederates</rs> build ships to oppose these <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> vessels, that is a violation of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The law does not justify the detention of the rams; but as they are to be used against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, they must be detained <hi rend="italics">against</hi> law, and Parliament must pass an <hi rend="italics">ex-post facto</hi> law rendering the detention legal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The foreign enlistment act does not prevent <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> per annum from emigrating to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to be enrolled as soon as they land at New York, to fight against the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; but this emigration is so clearly contrary to the spirit of that act that <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName> would no doubt stop it, and &#x0022;go down to Parliament&#x0022; for a new act, were these men destined for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, instead of Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>As, however, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s friends would feel the want of them in the coming campaign, it would be clearly contrary to the law of neutrality to stop them on their way to their graves in the swamps and ditches of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. --The <rs>Tuscaloosa</rs> is a Confederate cruiser, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has recognized the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as a belligerent power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It is perfectly just, therefore, to seize her, on the same principle that it was just to seize the rams &mdash; that is to say, she was designed to make war on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, according to <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s idea, is the guardian of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but not of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.
