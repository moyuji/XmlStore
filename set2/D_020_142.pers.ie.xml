<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Tis the mob of the <rs>North</rs>, and its mouthpiece, the press of the <rs>North</rs>, that has urged on their armies to certain defeat.-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> This mob rules despotically among our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Shall we install it in supreme power at the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>So far, our <rs type="role2">President</rs> and all our officers have disregarded the senseless clamor of home-keeping people, who talk and write ignorantly, thoughtlessly, and recklessly, about the conduct of the war, which they comprehend about as well as they do the <name>Chaldaic</name> language, or the <rs>Egyptian</rs> hieroglyphics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Out of danger's way themselves, they do not feel or care for the useless danger to which they would expose our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Our officers, whether volunteers or regulars, have exhibited remarkable prudence, caution, skill, and sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>as conscientious men they have endeavored to gain victory with little loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In this they have succeeded, because they have fought the enemy at advantage, and never at disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>An army acting on the defensive, in its own territory, may by retreating, choose its own position for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The Invading army must either cease to advance, give up its project of conquest, or attack it at disadvantage, in the strong position which it has selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Where such retreat is conducted in good order, the retreating army gathers strength daily from the surrounding country, and has little difficulty in procuring provisions, because it is always among friends whose resources have not been exhausted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> On the other hand, the invading army rapidly diminishes in numbers, from having daily to detail forces to keep open its line of communication with its base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Besides, with it the difficulty of obtaining provisions increases with each advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It must procure them from home, from which it is hourly receding, for it the retreating army have not entirety exhausted the supplies of the country through which it has passed, the people are unfriendly, and will not bring into the camp of their enemies the little that is left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If they send out foraging parties this still further weakens them, and exposes them to decimation in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> set out for <placeName reg="Moscow, Fayette, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100492">Moscow</placeName> with half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, and if we mistake not, had little over a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num> when he arrived there.

The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> present greater natural obstacles to an invading army than any equal area of country on the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Armies cannot march down our <placeName reg="Atlantic coast">Atlantic coast</placeName>, because of the great number of bays, inlets, <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs>, and rivers; nor down the inferior, because of mountain ridges, impassable roads, sparse population, and scarcity of provisions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> <placeName reg="The Mississippi">The Mississippi</placeName> is narrow, long, tedious, and easily defended, and its valley is subject to overflow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No invading army will attempt a serious invasion in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is our true policy to decoy the enemy into the interior, and then to cut them off as were <persName n="Braddock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Braddock,nomatch:0"><surname>Braddock</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Burgoyne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burgoyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Burgoyne</surname></persName>, and <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>, and <persName n="Ross,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Ross,G.,,,:1"><surname>Ross</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Packenham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Packenham,nomatch:0"><surname>Packenham</surname></persName>, and our own troops in the everglades of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>When we have defeated and captured their armies, exhausted their treasury, and cowed their spirits by defensive warfare, it will be time for us to begin to act on the offensive, and to invade their territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The Northwest is as level a country as <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Northern Europe</placeName>, teems with provisions, and abounds with towns and villages Its population is a spiritless rabble, who have few arms and know little of their use, and who are endowed with no sense of personal or national honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The Northeast rules them with a rod of iron, and, by its protective tariff, robs them of half the proceeds of their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They should welcome us as deliverers from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> bondage, rather than as conquerors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> are both weak and tempting points, and when we have well whipped the enemy within our own territory, it will be time to turn our attention to those cities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> we need not fear that we shall not have abundant opportunities, if we will but be prudent and cautious, to fight them at advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They have undertaken to conquer the <rs>South</rs>, and must advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, we may bide our time and opportunity, select our positions, and fight them only when it is policy to do so. They propose too, to go to the relief of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The form of this new vessel is to be that of a large potato, or <q>&#x0022;more like a whale,&#x0022;</q> the large proportion to be in the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>The circular build of the upper of the steamer, or covering is to be on such an angle that no cannon ball can strike it square, but must fly off, doing but little damage to the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The covering is to be made of certain metal that can be electrified from heavy batteries located in magazines in the centre of the ship, so that, on any attempt to board the vessel, every person making the effort would instantly be thrown off by the shock into the sea. In her bow, under water, she will carry a steel screw, which, revolving with great rapidity, will bore into any steamer or ship that she can approach, and then by a heavy charge of electricity inducted by the screw, the vessel thus bored into will be shivered to atoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>This new electric or galvanic steamer is to be made of the best material, at a cost of <measure n="1500000dollars" type="currency">$1,500,000</measure>, and it is computed, with her full armament on board, will draw about <num value="5">five</num> fathoms of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>The port-holes are to be opened by a spring, and after the discharge of the gun immediately closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Her hud is to be constructed on an entirely new method, and is to be proof against sinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Many other new ideas in the construction of the steamer are given by the inventor, but the above is sufficient to give the general plan of the vessel.--The inventor says that with such a steamer he would defy fleets of the combined world, and could enter any foreign port and destroy their cities without hazarding any risk of being injured by the firing of guns or the boarding of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> Our people assembled in the greatest excitement, and in the largest multitudes on the river bank, straining their eves out to catch a sight of the flashes of musketry and bending their ears to hear the roar of fire arms and the shooting of the different parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Conjecture ran wild with the number of the warriors, with the intentions of the assailants, and the determination of the defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Parties took sides at once and bets were offered and taken upon the defence and the assault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/> As daylight broke upon the scene of conflict hundreds of our citizens sought the tops of houses, lined the banks of the river, and raised themselves to the tops of trees, to catch a glance of the exciting tragedy being played to the shouting actors in our neighboring city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>And to tell the truth, his force seemed interminable as it deployed through the by paths, into full view, on the river bank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> The Rojas (<persName n="Caravajal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00356" reg="nearbymention:Caravajal,Viva,,,"><surname>Caravajal</surname></persName>'s party,) commenced a forward movement at an early hour after daylight, and in a short time the force inside the city was completely surrounded, being hemmed in at the plaza.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Barricades erected for the defence of the town were taken at the corner known as <placeName reg="Albino Lopez's store">Albino Lopez's store</placeName>, and also in front of the new theatre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The contester approached so near the river that their death-dealing missiles fell upon our side of the stream, creating quite a stampede amongst the crowds assembled on the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>The sally was short-lived, however, for the lines soon closed up again, and the <name>Rojas</name> were left master of the situation, so far as the suburbs of the town were concerned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/> The discharges of musketry were incessant during the day, but with cessations in their rapidity at different intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Both parties seemed to be deficient in artillery, as there were but few reports of cannon heard during the day. </p> 
<p>
