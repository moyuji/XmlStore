<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> Since my appointment I have performed the heaviest part of the work in your office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>I will assert that I have done twice the amount of labor of any of the clerks in your employ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Since the <rs type="place">House</rs> commenced its night sessions, you have required my constant attendance, both day and night in the <rs type="place">House</rs>, thereby allowing me only the few hours before the meeting of the <rs type="place">House</rs> in the morning to get up the <name>Journals</name>, (unless I should sit up nearly the whole night, which, of course, after the heavy duties of the actual session of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, from <time value="11am">11 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>During the last <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> I have more than once appealed to you for assistance, stating to you that the work of writing up the <name>Journal</name> was becoming too great for <num value="1">one</num> man to do, unless you would relieve me from attendance in the <rs type="place">House</rs> at night, and give me an opportunity to write up the <name>Journal</name> for the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Your engrossing clerk, although not working except during the sessions of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, you allowed <num value="2">two</num> assistants; and you yourself divide the labors of reading clerk with <persName n="Lamer,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Lamer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Lamer</surname></persName>.

<head>The Prospect Ahead.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> The war has filled the country with prophets.--But since their prophecies are various and directly conflicting it is clear that they cannot be truthful scers of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Some of them will probably hit the truth; but it will be more an accident than any gift of presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Ordinarily, men reasoning from existing facts may anticipate certain effects or results with more or less accuracy, according to their wisdom or their sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>But this war involves such a world of interests, such a variety of passions and prejudices, that it is impossible for human wisdom and foretaste to form a conclusion that bears upon its face <num value="1">one</num> whit more of probability than many others deduced from the same promises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> The general proposition that the war would not be a long <num value="1">one</num>.--which appeared to be that most entertained at the beginning of the struggle.--seemed plausible, upon the simple ground that such was the magnitude and costliness of the modern enginery of war that no nation could long maintain <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>But this has been rendered somewhat less plausible by the progress of the struggle; and now many who entertained the opinion <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> since have abandoned it, or feel that there is less force in it than they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> accorded to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> Of <num value="1">one</num> thing, however, we may all feel satisfied, and that in, that the war must have an end. A witty gentleman has remarked that &#x0022;nations never go to war but to make peace&#x0022; Of course, to that complexion the most bitter antagonist expects to come in good time before he threws down the wager of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is the last man in the world to enter a contest upon any other expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>No kind of man would consent to enter upon a ceaseless war if he could help himself, and that man of all others who keenly sororities all speculations and enterprises to see whether they will &#x0022;<persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName>&#x0022; would be the farthest from embarking in a struggle which had no end to it. Such an <num value="1">one</num> would certainly not &#x0022;pay&#x0022; If, having entered upon a war, he found that it would have no end unless he at his own motion cut it short, or withdrew from it, he would most assuredly do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He is envious and malignant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>He is cruel and revengeful; but he is too selfish, too fond of his own comfort and his own accumulations, to abandon his pursuits altogether, and give himself up entirely to the hardships and horrors of war; above all, to its exhausting effects upon the <name>Treasury</name>, and to its accumulation of debt and taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Therefore, whatever be the course of events otherwise, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will not allow this war to assume a permanent character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/> What is to be the mode and manner of the termination of the war, no man can foretell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>It is very probable that it will come when least expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>We believe there are causes at work at the <rs>North</rs> that will assist in solving the problem.--How or when they will demonstrate themselves actively remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The Lincoln Government feared this, and the <rs>Congress</rs> put immense powers into its hands to frustrate any demonstration with this purpose.
