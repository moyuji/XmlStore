<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> Every <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> knows, by the experience of his own country, where the shoe would begin to pinch the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>In that country, as elsewhere, any number of men can be procured to fight, after some fashion, in any cause good or had, if they are only well paid, well fed, well clothed, well housed, and moderately well commanded, with some prospect, if not of booty, at least of a whole skin So it becomes a question of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>A confidence in money alone has always proved false; but money there must be, and there is no country in which it is more necessary than in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, where wages are high and work is abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>A war will cost there almost as much as it did here; for if the work is nearer home, and the area of the war somewhat less than the whole surface of this terraqueous globe, still, for that very reason, there is much interruption of the ordinary pursuits of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>In the first place, all the bonds of debtor and creditor, whether public or private, and all the relations of business in cotton and other cultivation, are at an end. The State Governments themselves set the example of repudiation by refusing to cash bonds, or coupons, which can be traced to the possession of the other party in the struggle.-- Searching interrogatories are put, and must be answered on oath, before a State will pay interest which may field its way to hostile hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Meanwhile commerce is interrupted by blockades and privateers, and immense works commenced in the depth of peace are stopped by the withdrawal of hands and resources, and not less by a general diminution of confidence in the prospects of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>At <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, flounce observes the old forms of Union, and supposes a tax to be levied on all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It is obliged, however, to condescend to fact, and calculate on the certainty that only half the <name>States</name> will respond to the call. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> So the <rs>Congress</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is looking the difficulty, as they say there, <q>&#x0022;square in the face;&#x0022;</q> not so <q>&#x0022;square,&#x0022;</q> however, as they will <num value="1">one</num> day have to look it. There appears to be no difficulty in the authorization of loans to any amount; indeed, at this moment Government has large powers for the issue of Treasury notes for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and has found the market, we presume, unfavorable for the exercise of its powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The real question is how to find a proper basis for loans in an augmented and well paid revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>This involves taxation, and, unfortunately, taxation appears to be a point on which the <rs>Eastern</rs> and Western States of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> are almost as much at variance as both are with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The Western States have a particular objection to taxes; and when we read the war budget which the <rs>Congress</rs> seems finally to have decided on, <num value="1">one</num> feels that such an objection may be expressed not only in good sentences on the floor of Congress but also in a not less formidable manner far <persName n="West,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:West,nomatch:0"><surname>West</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Besides a direct tax of <measure n="20000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000</measure> apportioned among the <name>States</name>, and expected from only half, the new budget proposes a tax upon carriages, varying from <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> to <num value="50">fifty</num>; a tax upon watches, an excise duty on spirituous liquors of <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> a gallon, and on fermented liquors of <measure n="60cents" type="currency">sixty cents</measure> a barrel; and a general tax upon incomes, the rate of which, as well as the incomes liable, is not yet decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Meanwhile, the <name>Morrill</name> tariff is untouched except by the imposition of additional duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Every item in this budget suggests a financial war, as difficult, if not so sanguinary, as the war in the open field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> But there is another question which presents itself to the capitalist before even the solvency of a State, or the yield of a tax, or the final success of a cause, and that is, the number and frequency of similar calls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>If we are to judge from the imme <unclear>se</unclear> figures on paper paraden by the <name>Northerners</name>, this is a war that may take rank with any of ours &mdash; with the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> war, which cost us from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of money, or the <rs>Russian</rs> war, which cost us a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> in <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. If the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is obliged to ask for a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> to-day, when and how soon will it have to repeat that demand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>and how many such demands will it have to make this year, and for how many years?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Every such demand will compete in the market with the bounds of the last, and our old folks can remember with what celerity a promise to pay &#x00A3;<num value="50">50</num>.--Prudent people do not like buying stock at its present price when they know that <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> more will soon be thrown on the market for what it will fetch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Nor is this the only apprehension to damp the courage of the len&#x0153;er.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Already, while this war is still in its very cradle, the bankers of the seaboard States are suggesting, in the form of Treasury bonds, a very large increase of the paper currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>How long would this be convertible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We may safely predict that it the war lasts as long as it now threatens to last, both sides will be driven to the same pitiable expedient of a deprecated paper currency as the mother country was in a similar extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>No doubt there are enthusiasts in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who will lend money and buy Treasury bonds for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, all the more freely because they feel deeply the social and religious aspects of the quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Thereby, too, for aught we know, be Abolitionists and philanthropists in this country who will buy <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> notes in a falling market, and prefer to give a good price for them rather than a bad <num value="1">one</num>, because they care more for the credit of the <rs>Federal</rs> cause than they do for the amount of their own fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> The commuted stock of cotton at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> on last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> was <measure n="989070barrels" type="mass">989,070 bales</measure>, against <num value="1203320">1,203,320</num> at the same period of last year, when the quantity was unusually large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>As regards the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> qualities the stock is equal to about <measure n="20weeks" type="date">twenty weeks</measure> consumption at the rate lately witnessed; at this time last year it was equal to <measure n="28weeks" type="date">twenty-eight weeks</measure> consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>There then remains the important difference, as determining the market price, that last year there was every prospect of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> supply coming forward as usual, whereas now that supply is ordered to be stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Another point to be weighed is that the draught upon our stock for exportation will probably be larger this year than usual, as continental, and, perhaps, even <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> consumers-will fall upon our market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>This renders it more requisite that we should diminish our own consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>As the home trade have of late possessed themselves of a considerable supply by buying at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, it is computed that the stock which they hold is of about the same amount as last year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We have adduced sufficient to convince the general reader of the serious, not to say critical, character of the present condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>At the same time, although the progress of apprehension is broadly indicated by the unprecedented extent of the business done in the <name>Liverpool</name> cotton market during the last <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>, it would be wrong to omit from the account a number of points favoring the presumption that we shall yet side quietly over a considerable period before we arrive at the much dreaded cotton soarchty, which seems to be gradually creeping nearer and nearer. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> There remains, then, only the anxious questions, never absent from the mind of the cotton speculator &mdash; Will any portion of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> supply come forward, and if so, what portion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>They now occupy several important strategical points, upon which they are throwing up fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/><num value="1">One</num> of the greatest sources of discontent to our soldiers to the tediousness of doing nothing but waiting the tardy movements of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>Though most of our men are endearing hardships, in way of camp life, to which they have never been accustomed, we hear of no mutinies, no disturbances, no murmuring, no lack of confidence in the skill or judgment of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>But not a few have been disappointed at the endurance of our Southern men, on the score of the fatigues and privations of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>We see among our soldiers men who have been always used to all the comforts and luxuries of their homes, always accustomed to command, now doing their own cooking, taking care of their own horses, and yielding a cheerful obedience to every military order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>Can such a people be subjugated? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/> There has been and still is considerable sickness among the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>This fact in part accounts for the absence of so many; no that all the absentees are sick, but that certain localities having proved sickly, the camps have been removed to a short distance interior, where there is less danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>Yet are they not so far off as to be out of call in case of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>Much of the prevailing sickness is owing to unnecessary, if not imprudent, exposure, on account of the men not being acquainted with the peculiarity of our climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>Most of the sick are Georgians and <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>These men are very apt to do here as they would do at home; sit out after night, without being conscious of the danger arising from the heavy dews of this region at this season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>Then, to avoid exercise in the sun, their morning drills have been practiced at daybreak, while the dews are falling, or the for dense and the grass very wet. Such practices, however trifling they may appear, are sure to result in chills, fevers, and other complaints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>At the suggestion of an intelligent citizen, long a resident of this vicinity, this practice of early drilling has been abandoned of late, and is post poped till after breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>This charge will doubtless prove beneficial though it has not been in vogue sufficiently long to test the result by experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>Let me here drop a hint to our soldiers generally, who are exposed to marches and guard duty at night, especially at this sickly season &mdash; Many of them think they cannot endure the fatigue of night duty without the aid of alcoholic stimulants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>The dram is supposed, and no doubt honesty supposed, to be a sovereign preventive of and remedy for the dangers of night exposure &mdash; This, doubtless imparts a momentary exhilaration which is mistaken for a permanent benefit, while the consequent reaction leaves the system more exposed than before to the dangers sought to be avoided I say this without any reference to the moral bearing of the habit dram-drinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>Now, my advice, based upon long experience and much chervation, is <hi rend="italics">to lay aside spirits entirely</hi> and instead of drinking whiskey, when exposed and fatigued, <hi rend="italics">eat a biscuit</hi> or <hi rend="italics">even <sic>a a</sic> press of cold hoe cake.</hi> <num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> biscuits, such as soldiers make and use every day in camp, eaten during a <rs n="night watch" type="product">night watch</rs> or a night march, will do more immediate and perianant good than all the spirit nations that can be supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>At any rate, my advice, even it taken, like some old ladies' remedies, <unclear></unclear> will do no harm, if it does no good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>Try it <hi rend="italics">It will do good.</hi> It has been found that, even in the midst of dangerous epidemics, a moderate supply of good wholesome food, and there is nothing better than common home made biscuit, is a great preventive of dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>The charge shall be made for infants under <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of age, in charge of another person.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/> That there is great extortion daily practiced by the drivers of hacks, especially on strangers visiting this city, and much insolence on the part of drivers, there is no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>To prevent this as far as possible, positive instructions have been given to the <name>Police</name> to summon every violator of the ordinance to this office, to answer for the offence in the most summary manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>Its penalties will be rigidly enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>But many offences must necessarily go unpunished, unless those upon whom imposition and extortion are practiced, will give information at this office of the offender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>This can be done by taking notice of and furnishing the No. of the hack; and, to this extent, I invoke the aid of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>The necessity of this is at once obvious, as it is idle to give information of an offence without some clue to the offender.--The No. (required to be on every hack) will certainly disclose the owner as well as driver.--That those concerned may take heed, it is repeated that the highest penalties of the ordinance will be enforced against all who shall violate its provisions <persName n="Mayo,,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00479" reg="default:Mayo,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Mayo</surname></persName>. </p>
