<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> &#x0022;The question had frequently been asked him, &#x0027;how will you govern the rebel States if you conquer them?&#x0027; He thought if they were whipped, the rebel States would give up, as many others had done before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The proper way to secure this result was by earnestly supporting the <rs>Government</rs> of the country, and lending it every aid to put down the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>We had failed thus far by the failure to recognize the black element in the <rs>South</rs> and the white loyal element as those to be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> consulted in establishing the policy of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>We should have consulted the wishes of these people, instead of listening to the soft blandishments of such men as <persName n="Wickliffe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Wickliffe,nomatch:0"><surname>Wickliffe</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, or <persName n="Stanley,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, who in his opinion, were just as ready as <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> to cut our throats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>[Applause.] If it be necessary to bury <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> slaveholders to save <num value="25000000">twenty-five millions</num> of men, let the slaveholders be buried by all means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>[Applause] A rebel has no right to his life, to his property, or to liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>That is the plain law. Let us, therefore, carry it out. If not, what is to become of the loyal men of the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It was nothing to him who was put in the place of the slaveholder &mdash; a black man or a white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>[Applause] There was nothing to prevent the operatives of <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> or the <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> from participating in this movement.--[Applause.] Those who in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are complaining that their operatives are unemployed should send their laborers here, and we will give them land in abundance and enough to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Long before this he had been so loud in his professions of attachment to the <rs>South</rs> and its institutions, that he was regarded by her as the warmest friend she had north of <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName>'s and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s. He had been much in the <rs>South</rs>--had been received and entertained with the greatest hospitality wherever he went &mdash; and had always expressed himself delighted to the point of ecstasy with his entertainers, their country, and their institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>He had held office under <num value="1">one</num> Southern <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and been made a General in the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war by another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>He now acts according to his instinct &mdash; as a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and it would be as unreasonable to blame a rattle make for biting as him for turning upon his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>He cannot help it. It is his nature as a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, to be governed by expediency in all the transactions of life, and to take thought of principle only so far as it may be consistent with interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>That interest, just now, can he best subserved by supporting the wise and humane policy of his Government, which consists in exciting Southern slaves to insurrection against their masters.
