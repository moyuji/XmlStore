<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> General: I have the honor to offer the following reasons for moving the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> sooner than was anticipated by the <rs>President</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, or yourself, and for crossing at a point different from the <num value="1">one</num> indicated to you at our last meeting at the <rs>President</rs>'s: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> During my preparations for crossing at the place I had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> selected I discovered that the enemy had thrown a large portion of his force down the river and elsewhere, thus weakening his defences in front, and also thought I discovered that he did not anticipate the crossing of our whole force at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>; and I hoped, by rapidly throwing the whole command over at that place, to separate, by a vigorous attack, the forces of the enemy on the river below from the forces behind and on the crest, in the rear of the town, in which case we could fight him with great advantage in our favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> To do this we had to gain a height on the extreme right of the create which height commanded a new road lately made by the enemy for purposes of more rapid communication along his lines, which point gamed, his position along the crest would have been scarcely tenable and he could have been driven from them easily by an attack on his front in connection with a movement in the rear of the crest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> How near we came to accomplishing our object future reports will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>But for the fog and unexpected and unavoidable delay in building the bridges, which gave the enemy <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> more to concentrate his forces in his strong positions, we would almost certainly have succeeded, in which case the battle would have been, in my opinion, far more decisive than if we had crossed at the places <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>As it was, we came very near success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> Falling in accomplishing the main object, we remained in order of battle <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>--long enough to decide that the enemy would not come out of his strongholds to fight us with his infantry &mdash; after which we recrossed to this side of the river unmolested, without the loss of men or property. </p>
