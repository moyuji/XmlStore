<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The rumor that <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> had made a demand upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs> for the release of our Commissioners, <rs type="role" n="Mister">Messrs</rs>, <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Mason,George,,,:1"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, is probably untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Late <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> papers have been received at headquarters, but they make no mention of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It was reported, however, that the <rs>British Ambassador</rs> had remarked in private conversation that he would be obliged to make such a demand, and if his propositions were declined, should call for his passports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The rumor mentioned in the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> as coming from this post was founded upon a remark made by a distinguished politician, now a General in the army, who said there was no other course for <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>All the remarks I have seen upon the subject do not seem to get at the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In my opinion, formed by a slight reading of Vattel some time ago, I should think the whole matter hinged upon the knowledge from which port the vessel sailed. --Neutral ships sailing from blockaded ports, or ports in a country at war not declared blockaded, are forbidden to carry articles contraband of war. Arms, ammunition, dispatches, and Ambassadors would come under the head of contraband articles, and would be liable to seizure upon the ships of neutral nations provided they sailed from any of the above-mentioned ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi>--Since much has been said and written about the management and managers of the hospital at <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName>, Va, we, through a sense of justice due the <rs>Surgeon</rs> in charge of said hospital and his subordinates, have concluded to give you, for the benefit of those having friends and relations there, as graphic and as correct a statement of unpublished facts as we can. It has been our fortune to have as good opportunity of knowing of its management as any who have hitherto visited it. While some, through your columns, have reported favorably of its managers, others have been pleased to report most unfavorably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>We know not what their motives may have been, but to us such misrepresentations have the appearance of an under ground and a malicious work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>But, let that be as it may, the sin must fall upon their own heads; and the chief of that hospital will stand a living monument against all such fabrications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> The hospital buildings are <num value="8">eight</num> in number, <num value="6">six</num> of which are <measure n="200feet" type="distance">two hundred feet</measure> long, weatherboard and celled; each having in its centre a chimney with <num value="2">two</num> large fire-places, and each end supplied with a large stove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The <num value="2">two</num> other buildings are <measure n="150feet" type="distance">one hundred and fifty feet</measure> long and equally as comfortably warmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>All are sufficiently ventilated from the top by means of well-constructed ventilators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>These are each capacity to comfortably bed from <num value="60">60</num> to <num value="75">75</num> men, and the former <num value="6">six</num> <num value="100">one hundred</num> each, making an aggregate of <num value="750">750</num> to <num value="800">800</num> men nearly and comfortably bedded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> The strictest imaginable attention is paid to cleanliness, both in and outside of the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Every necessary means have been provided to keep the ground and wards clean and placed under the control of a general steward, <persName n="Taylor,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, who is untiring in his efforts to make himself equal to the duties that devolve upon him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> The hospital is laid off in divisions <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>; and each division subdivided into wards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>A surgeon is assigned to each division and an assistant to each ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>And to each ward, a ward master, nurse, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> servants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> So the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> has been assigned to <persName n="Kemper,Surgeon,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="default:Kemper,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Kemper</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Woodville, Rappahannock, Virginia" key="tgn,2115142">Woodville, Rappahannock county, Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>As a surgeon and physician he is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, and for his untiring and unceasing efforts in giving aid and comfort to the sick and wounded, he has merited an undying name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>He asks no higher honor than to comfort and apply a balm to a sick or wounded soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>As a man, he is <num value="1">one</num> of the most unpretending, unobtrusive, and unflinching gentlemen in our midst &mdash; kind, feeling, and attentive, with an ear ever open to hear the wants of the afflicted, and a hand ever outstretched to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>His assistants are attentive and prompt in performing the duties their position requires, each having his apportioned work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>They are temperate, kind, and feeling, and at all times ready and willing to administer to the wants and necessities of the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>In fact, he has an able and efficient corps of assistants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> To the <orgName type="division" n="division 2">second division</orgName> is assigned a Surgeon from <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>, whose name is <persName n="Houston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Houston,nomatch:0"><surname>Houston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The corps of assistants belonging to the <orgName type="division" n="division 2">second division</orgName> are equally as efficient, kind, feeling, temperate, and as much suited to the position they hold as those of the <orgName type="division" n="division 1">first division</orgName>. <num value="1">One</num> of them has had the experience of hospital practice in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He is a man of fine medical attainments, and just the man for the <orgName type="division" n="division 2">second division</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> The sick are well fed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>They not only have such &#x0022;diet&#x0022; as is allowed or provided for them, by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, in the military and medical regulations, but many of the delicacies the county and town of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> can furnish; and at no distant period, from the fund which is rapidly increasing, the sick and convalescent can be supplied with such diet as the <rs>Surgeons</rs> may require, and in such quantities as will serve the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/><num value="10">Ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> ladies are continually engaged in waiting upon the very sick, and preparing jellies, broths, soups, teas, and many other little articles of diet suited to the different stages of diseases. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>He is a native of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002155">Culpeper county</placeName>, and as near as we can judge is from <num value="55">55</num> to <measure n="60years" type="date">60 years</measure> old. In early life he received the appointment of <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> in the old Federal Navy, but when it become necessary for the <rs>South</rs> to dissolve her connection with the <rs>North</rs>, he too disclaimed loyalty to the hellish oligarchy, and came to the defence of his mother land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But when it was known he had resigned his position in the <rs>Federal Navy</rs>, he was at once commissioned <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Navy, and ordered to take charge of the <rs type="place">Culpeper hospital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>A better and more judicious selection could not have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>As <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> and Physician, he is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>As a man, he is a perfect gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>All know him but to respect and admire him. He, in managing the hospital, has systematized the whole, so that now all seems to work harmoniously together; and to the advantage of not only those concerned in its government, but to all who feel interested, directly or indirectly, in the comfort of the sick, as well as to those for whose comfort and aid it was established. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> Those having friends and relations in the <rs type="place">Culpeper Hospital</rs>, we think should console themselves with the knowledge that in <persName n="Green,Surgeon,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="nearbymention:Green,D.,S.,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">surgeon</roleName> <surname>Green</surname></persName> their children, brothers, fathers, and friends, have a friend, protector, and <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>He is ever ready and willing to contribute to the necessities of the sick or wounded &mdash; kind, feeling, and exceedingly attentive; and at no time does he fail to give friends and relations any information they may ask, either by letter or otherwise, concerning the sick in his charge. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Md. The following article, extracted from its columns, will show that there are some gallant representatives of the press in that down trodden and persecuted old States who cannot be silenced or driven to stultification by all the <rs>Federal</rs> bayonets which is in the power of that king of tyrants, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, to distribute throughout its dominions, in order to overawe all the citizens of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> into submission to his unholy crashed against the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> Notwithstanding the fact, that the late election in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> fully evidenced the inability <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> of the <rs>Peace Party</rs> in the <rs>State</rs> to frustrate or thwart the designs of the <rs>Washington Government</rs>, and the further fact, that the people of this State have adopted the policy of that Government by a majority of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> votes, we find, as we heretofore predicted, that there has been no relaxation of vigilance, on the part of the autocrat or his premier, towards the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Nor does it matter whether or not the result of the late election is a fair indication of the popular will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> We may and do think the contrary, but the <rs>Government</rs> has accepted it as such, and should have so based its subsequent action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It claims that the election was perfectly fair, you it reposes no confidence in the loyalty of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The Federal force in <placeName reg="Baltimore Independent City, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,7021987">Baltimore city</placeName> and else where in the <rs>State</rs>, has not been diminished, nor have arrests for opinion's sake been less frequent or of a less aggravated and unscrupulous character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The soil of St. Mary's, heretofore unpolluted by the tread of the mercenary and the detective &mdash; except in instances where charges have been trumped up of a treasonable character &mdash; has of late been invaded, and her citizens dragged from their homes, without a moment's warning, or even the mere formula of a trial, that they may answer at the bar of Federal opinion for such imaginary crimes as spies may think fit to charge them with, or the <rs>Government</rs> may suspect them of having committed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> Is it not sufficient for the <rs>Government</rs> to know that the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs>, through the potency of its influence, hold the rains of power, and will rule this State just as it may please to direct them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Is it not enough for it to know that the gallant and undaunted few who still cling to their opinions, and maintain at the ballot box their rights, regard <unclear></unclear> of the consequences which a despotism may inflict, are, in this State, in a hopeless and powerless minority?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Are vengeance and love of oppression so sweet, or the desire for a field of conquest &mdash; which it seems is not else where so easily found &mdash; so strong, as to demand this persecuting policy at the hands of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> Of the several arrests recently made in this county we have, in <num value="1">one</num> instance, the full particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>A portion of the <rs>Federal</rs> command &mdash; either of the soldiery or police &mdash; visited the house of the party, represented themselves as friendly to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and asked for supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The supper was prepared and partaken of a free and unreserved conversation ensued, the host unbosomed himself to the supposed refugees and freely expressed his opinions and sympathies in connection with the unfortunate struggle in which the country is engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>His opinions &mdash; like these of <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of the people of this county &mdash; were in opposition to the war, and in favor of peaceable secession rather than reunion by force, and he so expressed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Ere the next sun arose he was arrested, and is now a Federal prisoner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> If the mere expression of an adverse opinion is sufficient cause for arrest, let the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> prepare other for tresses and build new Bastiles, for they can readily find plenty of occupant is for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Nor need they reflect such damning infamy upon the character of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> soldiery and <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> institutions by resulting to such means as above narrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The ballot box, it the late election, closely as it was guarded by Federal bayonets, still unfolds a tale that renders, for similar cause, the arrest of many <num value="1000">thousands</num> necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>These are the reasons that have reached us for the arrest of a citizen of this county, and, if there are other cause, they are unknown to ourselves or the friends of the party. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> Such an arrest, made under such circumstances, would certainly reflect, disgrace and dishonor upon any Government but this; and, if this course is to be persisted in towards the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, it would have been far better had they reserved their evidence of loyalty until better terms of protection had been procured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>To what end this course of policy will lead we shall not attempt to predict, but we can readily imagine a condition of things under which submission, like prudence, would cease to be a virtue. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> On the morning of the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="25">25th instant</day></dateStruct> a large body of Federal cavalry, numbering over <num value="100">100</num>, dashed down upon our pickets, stationed along, or near, a stream known as &#x0022;<placeName reg="Difficult Creek, Bedford, Virginia" key="tgn,2287519">Difficult Run</placeName>, &#x0022; about <num value="8">eight</num> or <placeName><distance reg="9miles">nine miles</distance> from our camp</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>A few shots were fired--<num value="1">one</num> of which, we have since learned, took effect, breaking the leg of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and wounding his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>They immediately wheeled and fled &mdash; that is, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--and made sundry extravagant reports along their route returning to their camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> As it was evident that large bodies of them had been prowling along our lines for several days with mischievous purposes, our commander, <persName n="Ransom,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00508" reg="mostcommon:Ransom,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Ransom</surname></persName>, determined yesterday (<num value="26" type="ordinal">26th</num>) to take a sufficient force with him, and see if he could not succeed in capturing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Accordingly on yesterday morning, a detail of <num value="120">120</num> men was made for the purpose, who proceeded about <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> to our line of pickets; relieving the <num value="2">two</num> companies who had been out the night and day past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The companies thus relieved constituted also a portion of the scouting party, they having been ordered to the rear as a reserve or <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We passed on for several miles without our lines, and in a westwards direction; turning our course towards <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName> we learned that a large body of the enemy's cavalry was only about half an hour in advance, and ascertaining that there were fine prospects for a fight the countenances of the men brightened up with lively expectations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>It soon became very evident that we were near upon them, and our <rs type="role">Col.</rs> ordered a halt, immediately west of <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>; and riding along our column, already formed into fours, with his face beaming with joyous emotions, he told us that we were on them; &#x0022;and now, boys,&#x0022; he says, &#x0022;I want you to show them the stuff you are made of. They are between us and our camp, and we must put them through, no difference what their numbers are! &#x0022; &#x0022;We are ready,&#x0022; was the spontaneous expression of nearly every man; and on we went, through town and out in the direction of our camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> We had not reached the summit of the hill immediately South of the deserted village, before our scout reported them just at the foot, on the other side, in unknown numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Rising the hill, our front ranks poured a sharp fire into their column, front their rifles and carbines, and instantly the clear, loud tones of our <persName n="Ransom,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00509" reg="mostcommon:Ransom,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Ransom</surname></persName> rings along the on tire line, heard above the shouts and rattle in front, &#x0022;Charge, boys ! charge ! I know you wont disgrace yourselves !&#x0022; And then, such a wild, keen shout as rent the air, never yet has fallen upon my ears, and our column commenced pouring down the hilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>On, on they flew, and louder, rose the shouts; and as I sped down the road, on my gallant charger, rapidly passing man after man, I soon found myself gazing upon the splendid bodies of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, their beautiful blue overcoats spreading on the evening air, as they had wheeled after firing <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> perfectly harmless rounds at us. <persName n="Gordon,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00510" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> fed on the column, and very soon was far ahead of any of his men. We all knew now that their entire force was flying rapidly before us, and every man of us strove the harder to overtake and capture his prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>We had chased them a bout a mile, capturing and killing several, when they made a sudden wheel to the right, and made out in direction of their camp with all the speed of hard-spurred horses; but gaming an eminence about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">600 yards</measure> from where they wheeled, they made an effort to rally their men and offer fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> It was now supposed that they were falling out upon a reenforcement of infantry, and some of our officers made an effort to arrest the progress of our men, in order to obtain the advantage of the situation, and give them another charge in better order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>But a few men rushed on needlessly &mdash; dashed out the lane, and made good time towards the blue coats, who again fired another harmless volley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>They were holy pursued, with a reckless prayers unparalleled, by as many of our men as could break ranks and pass the blockaded portion of the road; for, mean while, our men overtaking and capturing about <num value="20">twenty</num> in the road and fields before they had wheeled to the right, and the command having been is sued to rally, the road had become almost impassable, and no alternative was left but for our men to leap the fences and take through the fields, which several did quite successfully, pursuing the fugitives about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, to a point beyond the railroad, and so contiguous to their lines that they deemed it inadvisable to go farther. </p>
