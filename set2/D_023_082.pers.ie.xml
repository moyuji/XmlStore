<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> From our Northern files, of the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">2d instant</day></dateStruct>, we continue our extracts of current news: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York world</orgName> on <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s proclamation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">World</hi></orgName> has a long article on <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s emancipation proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It says that he has <q>&#x0022;swing loose from the constitutional <unclear> </unclear> of his inaugural address and his messages at the opening of the <num value="2">two</num> successive sessions of Congress under his administration, and is fully adrift on the current of radical fanaticism.&#x0022;</q> From the article we extract the following: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> He has been coerced by the insanity of the radicals, by the denunciation of their presses, by the threats of their Governor and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> that he should resign, into a proclamation which, on its face, violates the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is contrary to the general current of civilization in the conduct of war as it has run since the <name>Crusades</name>, is in opposition to the solemn declarations made by our Government that this was not to be a war of subjugation, and in manifest obstruction of the re-union of those States for which the nation has fought, and is ready to lavish its blood and treasure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> We demand to be informed whence the <rs>President</rs> derives his power to issue any such proclamation as he has now published!. Not from the <rs>Constitution</rs> surely, for it is in plain violation of some of its leading provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Not from the laws of war, for the laws of war tolerate <unclear></unclear> Not even from the <unclear></unclear> called confiscation act, which the <rs>President</rs> was at <num value="1">one</num> time on the point of vetoing, for the proclamation does not conform to its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This proclamation is made in pursuance of that higher law &mdash; that is to say, that open defiance of law &mdash; which has distinguished the tribe of pestilent abolition agitators from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Their moral notions are so sublimated and transcendental that they do not recognize the obligation of a compact, or the binding force of an oath, or the authority of a constitutional law duty enacted.--They acknowledge no law but their own unregulated impulses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Sectional hate, party spirit, political passions inflamed to diabolical fury &mdash; these are the &#x0022;higher-law&#x0022; of these wretched <unclear></unclear> in comparison with which the sacred obligations of the fundamental law of the land and the public law of nations are as light, in their estimation, as the feathers of a gossamer's wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In obedience to this higher law of unreasoning passion they undertook, many years ago, to annul <num value="1">one</num> distasteful but minor provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; now they give loose rains to their fanaticism and drive with a coach and <num value="6">six</num> through the very body of the instrument. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The Constitution confers on the <rs>Federal Government</rs> no power to change the domestic institutions of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This policy makes changes of the most violent and sweeping character, changes which even the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, in its National Conventions, disclaimed any intention of making and admitted to be unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The Constitution property of all citizens from forfeitures by civil penalty without trial and conviction; this policy inflicts heavy penalties without even the pretence of a trial &mdash; inflicts them on all the citizens of whole States, without even the pretence of any discrimination between the innocent and the guilty, blending them all into <num value="1">one</num> indistinguishable mars without any regard to whether they had <unclear> </unclear> against the <rs>Government</rs> or were non-combatants or whether they had gone into the rebellion voluntarily, of had been coerced into it by the terrorism which has prevailed at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The Constitution describes the crime of levying war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as treason, and makes certain broad regulations respecting its punishment; but the policy in question assumes to punish levying war in a different way from what the <rs>Constitution</rs> allows it to be punished, by punishing it under some other name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A men cannot be constitutionally punished as a traitor till he has been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tried; but the policy attempts to circumvent the <rs>Constitution</rs> by inflicting the punishment under some other form than as a penalty of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A universal confiscation of the private property of non-combatants, throughout whole States, without trial, without any attempt to distinguish between innocent and guilty, or between the property of full grown male citizens and that of minors and orphans, held by guardians of trustees, is alike contrary to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and to the laws of civilized war, which respect the private property of non-combatants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> If we descend from the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the confiscation act, we shall find this extraordinary proclamation indefensible even on the principles of that act. That law does not act on the gross population of areas of country, but on individual persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The forfeitures it denounces are confined to persons in rebellion against the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>What can be more preposterous, or a more monstrous perversion of justice, then to make the guilt <unclear></unclear> of an <unclear></unclear> depend on whether the <name>States</name> in which he happened to be born shall have representatives in Congress on the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It would be sufficiently monstrous to make a man's right to his property depend on his own exercise of the elective franchise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Never was there so degrading a entire on <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> institutions as the <unclear></unclear> voting required by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But when a man's property is made to dependant on whether he chooses to vote himself, but on whether his fellow-citizens choose to vote, and whether the number voting under this executive <unclear></unclear> happens to be a majority, we are lost in astonishment that a chief magistrate of a tree country should undertake to make citizens perform what ought to be their freest act under coercing, and to convert the ballot box into a criminal tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>What has the number of votes cast in a criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>What has the number of votes cast in a particular election to do with the question whether a particular citizen is guilty of treason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Why should women, minors, and orphans, be deprived of their property in consequence of the neglect of citizens to vote. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> This extraordinary proclamation will bring no advantages to the negro race at all proportionate of the obstructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It throws in the way of reunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is certain that the <rs>Union</rs> will never be restored till this ill advised action of the <rs>Government</rs> <unclear></unclear>. It converts every inhabitant of the <rs>South</rs> into a zealot whose all is embarked in the success of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The idea that they will <unclear></unclear> to threats, that they will vote on compulsion that they will feel terror or misgivings, or anything but increased indignation, at such a proclamation shows small knowledge either of human nature or of the temper of the <rs>Southern</rs> mind.--Such a proclamation cannot possibly be enforced, and its only effect will be to strengthen the determination of the rebels to fight to the very last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They are shut up to a lane which has no turning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When the military power of the rebels is broken we have laid before ourselves a still harder task to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>At the very crisis of the contest of arms the <rs>President</rs> has reinforced them as effectually as if he had doubled their squadrons in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We may learn from our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They will rejoice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Their leaders will make of this proclamation their chiefest moral weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is powerless in our hands for good in theirs, it will be potent for evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Our only <unclear> vation</unclear> now is in the ballot box. To that it yet remains possible for the people to resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>There the battle lost to-day may be won to- morrow &mdash; there alone the insulted majesty of the <rs>Constitution</rs> may be vindicated by the people against its faithless custodians. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York World"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>How far he succeeded in proving his theory, it is not important to know, since it is certain that, he convinced himself, and that is as much as most arguments ever succeed in accomplishing.--Perhaps the result is fairly stated in those well known lines of <persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName>: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> <persName n="Berkley,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Berkley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Berkley</surname></persName> was doubtless a great oracle; but, fortunately for mankind, when he died wisdom did not perish with him. His mantle seems to have fallen on successive philosophers, until, somehow, it has found its way to the shoulders of <persName n="Vinton,Reverend,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Vinton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev. Dr.</roleName> <surname>Vinton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>This sage has the advantage, in <num value="1">one</num> respect, over his illustrious predecessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>He is not only a distinguished warrior in the ranks of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> militant, but is also well acquainted with the use of the carnal weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>He is both soldier and theologian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>He is not only a graduate in divinity, but a pupil of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>He has been taught not only to administer consolation to the dying, but to put men in a way to need that sort of consolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>He is skillful not only in comforting the soul, but in divorcing it from the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>He has proved, beyond all question, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have never been defeated on any occasion since this war began; but that, on the contrary, they have always been victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>This announcement seems strange, but it must be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>A doctor of divinity says so, and doctors of divinity cannot lie. A graduate of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> says so, and students of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> know all about war. In order to be thoroughly convinced, the novice must surrender himself to the doctrine of <persName n="Berkley,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Berkley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Berkley</surname></persName>, and conclude that all appearances are delusions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> And yet, after all, it seems strange even to a convert, which we profess to be. We cannot forbear asking what upon earth the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> ran for if they were not beaten at <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2016605;tgn,2036878" n="0.130 000000.7809	placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.087 000000.5206	placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;0.043 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America">Bethel</placeName>. --Their conduct at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> was still more in comprehensible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>There they ran farther than soldiers ever were known to run before, and faster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>They threw away everything they had about them &mdash; arms, cartridge-boxes, knapsacks, haversacks, blankets, hats, and sometimes even shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>They left everything they could not carry on their persons behind them, such as cannon, baggage wagons, horses, military and medical stores, &#x0026;c. Again, in these battles around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> they ran from <num value="1">one</num> fortification to another until they pulled up under shelter of their gunboats, <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> from where they started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>To a man who has been in the habit of trusting to his senses, this looks very much like defeat; but the doctor evidently does not think the senses ought to be trusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>According to his theory, <q>&#x0022;seeing is not believing.&#x0022; </q> When, therefore, we saw <measure n="12000" type="prisoners">12,000 prisoners</measure>, <num value="51">51</num> guns, and <num value="47000">47,000</num> stand of arms brought to this city, we saw the best evidence in the world that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had been victorious, except that afforded by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s retreat from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> without ever having taken it. But for the light that <persName n="Vinton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Vinton,nomatch:0"><surname>Vinton</surname></persName> has thrown upon this intricate subject, we should have followed the vulgar old rule of trusting to eyesight, and should have believed that the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and not the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, were victorious at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> <num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>and <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, when we saw that <measure n="18000" type="prisoners">18,000 prisoners</measure>, and more than <num value="100">100</num> guns, were the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But we stand rebuked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> gained the victory. --The doctor of war and divinity says so. The doctor himself will admit, however, that it will take some time to conquer the country by victories like these. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> A late periodical writer (in the <name>Edinburgh</name> <hi rend="italics">Review,</hi>) says that he who overthrows a great military reputation renders an essential service to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>In this sense <persName n="Vinton,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Vinton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Vinton</surname></persName> is the greatest benefactor of whom humanity can boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>He has overthrown every military reputation that ever existed, in a single lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>He shows that when <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> piled the <placeName reg="field of Cann">field of <persName n="Cann,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Cann,nomatch:0"><surname>Cann</surname></persName></placeName>&#x00E6; with the bodies of <num value="80000">80,000</num> <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> he was ignominiously defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He shows that <persName><foreName>Pompey</foreName></persName>, and not C&#x00E6;sar, was victorious at Pharsalia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>He shows that the <name>Russians</name> and Austrians conquered at <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Lucas, Ohio" key="tgn,2140495">Austerlitz</placeName>, and that <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> was beaten at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We are afraid, however, that mankind is too stupid to understand the <rs>Doctor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>They can never be made, we very much apprehend, to believe that flight means victory, or that pursuit means defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>In spite of his unanswerable logic, they will obstinately persist in believing that the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Republic was nearly overthrown at <persName n="Cann,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Cann,nomatch:0"><surname>Cann</surname></persName>&#x00E6;, and that the <rs>French Empire</rs> was prostrated at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>As the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> wish to possess our country, and as they certainly will not get it by running, we see not what besides glory they are to derive from this new definition of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The stoic <rs>Zeno</rs> taught that pain was no evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>This must have been very consoling to a man in a fit of the gout &mdash; as much so as must be to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the annunciation that they conquered at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> If glory is the sweetest reward of the soldier, it must be some consolation to our brave troops to know that the whole world is ringing with praises of the heroism and fighting qualities of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>In the midst of their unparalleled privations and toils, and, in the face of their brutal and malignant foe, it must afford come satisfaction that the whole human race is looking upon them with wonder and admiration.--Like the warriors of Christianity, they are encompassed by a cloud of witnesses, who scan with eager eyes the records of their courage and self-denial, and repeat to the world with glowing lips the story of their fame. --These noble spirits, who pass us every day in such humble guise &mdash; these unpretending noblemen of Nature, who do not seem conscious that they are performing actions of any extra ordinary merit--(it is a literal truth that we have never heard since this war commenced a single Southern officer or soldier speak in a boastful tone of any battle in which he had been engaged,)--are making a history that will flash down the tide of time a lustre of glory and self-sacrifice that neither <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> nor <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> ever surpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>It is no ordinary heroism that draws from the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> and other sober <name>English</name> journals, who always measure their phrases carefully and never deal in extravagant compliment, such laudations as those we lately published.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> Such is the homage which Southern valor and patriotism have extorted from the most intelligent and influential organs of public opinion in the old world, from men well versed in the history of ancient and modern times, who, in enemy syllable that they have uttered, have anticipated, we are perfectly sure, the unanimous verdict of posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is no ordinary valor and virtue that have caused the Old Lion of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, whose roar has so often shaken the world, to look on in wonder and admiration. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> Even the rabid organ of <name>English</name> abolitionism, the <hi rend="italics">News,</hi> whilst it denounces the <rs>South</rs> as the most barbarous of mankind, exclaims repeatedly, <q>&#x0022;they will fight.&#x0022;</q> We should esteem that, however, no compliment at all, if the allegation of the <hi rend="italics">News</hi> were true, that the <rs>South</rs> is <q>&#x0022;the most barbarous of mankind.&#x0022;</q>--How little the <hi rend="italics">News</hi> knows of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, or how reckless it is of truth when it speaks thus!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Its sources of knowledge as well as its inspirations of sentiment are purely Northern, or it could never speak thus of a people whose virtues in domestic life are equal to their prowess in the field, and whose generosity, unselfishness, and hospitality have long ago passed into a proverb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Even in the conduct of the present war, if they had not been the most civilized, instead of the most barbarous people of the world, they would have hoisted the black flag at the beginning of this abominable invasion, and demanded an eye for an eye and a life for a life, instead of continuing to adhere to the rules of regular warfare in the face of such proclamations as those of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> and such deeds as the hanging of <persName n="Mumford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Mumford,nomatch:0"><surname>Mumford</surname></persName>.--We hope and believe that the time will come when the moderation and humanity of the <rs>South</rs> will be as well understood as its chivalry and heroism. </p> </div3> </div2>
