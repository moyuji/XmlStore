<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> --Yesterday morning the <rs>Mayor</rs>, before commencing his docket, asked the attention of the reporters to a few remarks which he designed submitting relative to the new gaming law, and his enforcement of it. He said it had been stated that he had pronounced the new law unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>This he declared to be an error, for its provisions were precisely similar to an old act which the <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName>, in the case of <persName n="Wyatt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Wyatt,John,,,:1"><surname>Wyatt</surname></persName>, had pronounced constitutional. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> In the case of <persName n="Worsham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:Worsham,nomatch:0"><surname>Worsham</surname></persName>, which came before him last week under the new gaming law, the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> had failed to show that faro bank, or any like game, had been exhibited by him, or in his house, since its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>He had issued a warrant for the entry and search of that house, and besides arresting the parties at play there, and taking possession of the negroes, he had an inventory taken of all the property in the house, and had held it until the party charged was examined before him, and he had been satisfied that the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> could not prove the exhibition of faro bank, or a like game, from the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="16">16th inst.</day></dateStruct>, (the time at which the law was passed by the <name>Legislature</name>,) to that moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Without evidence to prove a violation of the law, he could do no less than release the property, which would have been subject to confiscation under the new law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> After releasing the property, the <rs>Mayor</rs> held <persName n="Worsham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Worsham,nomatch:0"><surname>Worsham</surname></persName> for further examination, taking the ground that the new law did not entirely repeal the old <num value="1">one</num>, and that the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, if she could prove that he had exhibited, or been interested in, faro bank at any time within the past <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, could yet punish him under the old law. If faro bank had been exhibited anterior to the passage of the present gaming law, that law could not be retroactive in its provisions, and confiscate property, or inflict punishment, for crimes committed before its passage; for that would be an <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">expost facto</hi></foreign> law in its effect, and per consequence would be unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>He did not say, and did not design to be misunderstood as saying, that the &#x0022;gaming law passed by the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName> on the <date value="1863-10-16">16th October, 1863,</date>&#x0022; was <hi rend="italics">unconstitutional</hi> in all or any of its provisions.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> As a magistrate, he had given his individual opinion of the law and the facts, and he hoped ever to have the independence to express his opinion on all matters that may come before him, regardless of what may be said by newspapers or individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>He wanted what he said to be fairly represented, and asked for nothing more. </p> </div3>

<head>The currency.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> Schemes for mending the currency are as plentiful as blackberries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>None of them seem to command universal assent, although all of them are worthy of consideration.--The <num value="1">one</num> reported to the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> by <persName n="Buford,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Buford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buford</surname></persName>, proposes to raise <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure> by joint subscription of the <name>States</name>, and of individuals and corporations, the debt to be funded, and not subject to taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>This is objected to on the score of its creating in our midst a species of privileged property, the holders of which must, of necessity, become privileged persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>This, it is alleged, is contrary to the spirit of our institutions, and is calculated to excite the hatred of our people and by consequence to bring on the risk of repudiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Another objection to it is insisted on, viz: that it requires the assent of all the <name>States</name>, which it is not likely to get, or to get at so late a period as to render it of no value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/><persName n="Marshall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Marshall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 18" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName>, has a scheme before the <name>Senate</name>, the features of which we do not understand well enough to attempt an explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>A writer in the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer,</hi> who hails from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, proposes a forced loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>We ourselves have long since proposed a Confederate loan, based upon the principle of the <rs>National Loan</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, but it seems to have met with little attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We very much fear, from what we have seen and heard within the last few weeks, that any plan, to be successful, must be compulsory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> In the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>,</hi> of yesterday, <persName n="Stuart,Mister,Alexander,H.,H.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="default:Stuart,Alexander,H.,H.,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> comes forward with a plan of his own. He supposes the whole property of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, within the reach of Confederate taxation, to be worth <measure n="4500000000dollars" type="currency">$4,500,000,000</measure>, specie valuation, or about <measure n="20000000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000,000</measure> in Confederate currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>He proposes to lay an assessment upon this property of <num value="0.12">twelve per cent.</num>, specie valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>This would yield <measure n="540000000dollars" type="currency">$540,000,000</measure>. Of this <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num>, or <measure n="90000000dollars" type="currency">$90,000,000</measure>, is to be considered a tax, and the other <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num>, or <measure n="450000000dollars" type="currency">$450,000,000</measure>, is to be considered a loan, and funded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The loan will extinguish enough of the currency to leave <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure>, all we have need of, in circulation, while the surplus of <measure n="90000000dollars" type="currency">$90,000,000</measure> will be left for other purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>All these plans concur in insisting upon the absolute necessity of stopping the issue of Treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>That is regarded as absolutely indispensable by everybody. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> There is <num value="1">one</num> plan better than any of these, were we blessed with a Congress that had the nerve to pass it. It is to lay a tax which shall bring into the treasury at once enough money to retire all the treasury notes now afloat, or afloat at the time of the passage, with the exception of only so much as is necessary for the business of the country &mdash; that is, according to the estimate of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>, about <measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">$150,000,000</measure>. When this money shall have been brought in, let it be destroyed and not funded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The system of funding is a radical defect in every plan yet proposed &mdash; our own among them &mdash; and was only adopted, we are persuaded, because Congressmen were afraid to levy the necessary taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It enhances more than anything else the distrust in Confederate securities which begins to be prevalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>We do not believe that a debt accumulated in this way will ever be repudiated; but men of capital are proverbially the most timid of all <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> creatures,--they not only have their doubts, but communicate them to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Besides, we should like to see the <rs>Confederacy</rs> start upon the great career, to which undoubtedly it is destined, untrammeled in any respect whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>A tax of <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> on the value of the property of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, estimated in our currency at <measure n="20000000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000,000</measure>, will yield <measure n="600000000dollars" type="currency">$600,000,000</measure>. This is more than enough to retire all that we wish to retire (about <measure n="450000000dollars" type="currency">$450,000,000</measure>) and leave <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> in circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>As the present condition of the currency arose from the ignoble fears of Congress &mdash; their fears for their popularity &mdash; they could make atonement for their former sins in no manner so appropriate and at the same time so effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The disease is alarming; but it is far from being beyond reach of remedy, and no man will deny that this is the remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>We are confident that members mistake the character of their constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They prefer a tax for the purpose of redeeming the currency to burdens laid on for paying the interest of a huge national debt. </p> </div3>
