<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> It is a common boast of the <rs>North</rs>, and religiously believed by most of its people, that cold climates beget and keep alive self-reliance, energy, enterprise, skill and inventiveness; and that warm climates produce indolence, carelessness, ignorance and improvidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If that be the fact, we wonder that they do not stick to their cold climates instead of seeking to settle in latitudes where the enervating influences of the sun may cause them to degenerate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> But there are certain facts in the history of mankind which conflict seriously with this favorite Northern theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We do not mention these in a spirit of self-complacency, but simply in self-defence, and in defence of the <rs>Sun</rs>, which performs some important offices in the economy of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This much, at least, must be conceded: No Northern man will contend that the sun diminishes the energy of vegetation, or begets weakness and effeminacy in the animal life. --No <num value="1">one</num> will pretend that the gigantic growth of Southern vegetation is surpassed in Northern latitudes, or that the lion, the tiger, the elephant, the <name>Arab</name> horse, are inferior in strength, courage and speed to the animals of cold countries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> If man is an exception to this rule; if the sun, which develops and energizes all the rest of creation, which stimulates, fosters and perfects all plants and all animals, renders humanity effeminate and indolent, we should like to see some evidences of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>We do not find that evidence in the condition of the aboriginal races of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered by <rs n="European" type="group">Europeans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>In the high latitudes, the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> were rude, improvident and savage; in all the tropical parts of the continent, in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, <placeName reg="Central America" key="tgn,7016739">Central America</placeName> and <placeName reg="Peru" key="tgn,1000056">Peru</placeName>, they exhibited forecast, skill, inventiveness, and were surrounded by vast architectural remains, that proved the existence of an immemorial civilization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> If we go to the Old World, we look in vain for any illustration of the self-complacent Northern proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We find that man was created about the centre of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName>, and we should thence infer that region was the most favorable locality for his full growth and development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We are no bigots on this subject; not extreme, by any means, in our vindication of the <rs>Sun</rs>. The Sun, no doubt, has his faults, a spot or <num value="2">two</num> here and there; but, on the whole, is a benignant luminary, not unfavorable to human progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We are disposed to concur with a theory, that as we recede from the isothermal latitude of creation, and go too far north, or too far south, man and all other created things deteriorate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Nevertheless, it is better to have too much sun than too little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>In the equatorial and tropical regions of the Old World there is abundant monumental and architectural evidence that, before <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> existed, those regions were always inhabited by energetic and civilized races, while in the <rs>Northern</rs> latitudes there was only a dreary waste of ignorance and barbarism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> It was under a glowing sun that the patriarchs, prophets and apostles of Divine Revelation were called to the great mission of reclaiming the human race from the ruins of the fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It was under such a sun that <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Joshua</foreName></persName>, <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Solomon</foreName></persName> were matured to the most vigorous manhood and the loftiest wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It was there that the <rs>Sun</rs> of Righteousness <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arose, and blended its fructifying rays with that luminary, which is spoken of in Scripture as a type of the spiritual energy and life-giving power of the <rs type="role" reg="IsFather">Son of</rs> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Why has <placeName reg="Asia" key="tgn,1000004">Northern Asia</placeName> been always <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> barbarous, and <placeName reg="Asia" key="tgn,1000004">Southern Asia</placeName> been always civilized ?
