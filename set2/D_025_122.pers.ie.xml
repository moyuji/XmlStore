<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is not considered improbable, however, in official circles, that the enemy will make a movement of some kind in the next few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>What that work is &mdash; whether an attack upon Lookout, or a movement upon our left in the direction of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> &mdash; we shall probably know by the end of the month &mdash; possibly by the end of the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>If neither the <num value="1">one</num> nor the other, then the only alternative left him will be to go into winter quarters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> In my letters of the <dateStruct value="--09"><day reg="9">9th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th inst.</day></dateStruct> attention was called to the condition of the horses in this army, the limited supply of animals, the consequent necessity of taking proper care of those employed in the public service, and the propriety of exempting brood mares from impressment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It was stated also that the matter of the supply of horses was then engaging the attention of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I have since learned that he has issued a most excellent order upon the subject, the object of which is to correct some of the abuses now existing in the army in regard to horses and forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The order announces that officers and soldiers with be allowed to keep the number of horses for which they are allowed forage, and no more; and no person not allowed forage, will be permitted to keep a horse or a mule, without a special order from army headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The following is the allowance of mounted men to different headquarters and staff officers: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Corps headquarters, <num value="1">one</num> company of cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Division headquarters, <num value="1">one</num> company of cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Brigade headquarters, <num value="3">three</num> couriers, to be furnished from the company at division headquarters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Corps and division quartermasters and commissaries, <num value="2">two</num> mounted messengers each; brigade quartermasters and commissaries, <num value="1">one</num> messenger each; and regimental headquarters, <num value="1">one</num> mounted orderly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> No others are allowed, and all public horses and mules now in possession of forage masters, and all, whether public or private, in possession of quartermaster, <rs type="role" n="Commissary">commissary</rs>, and ordnance sergeants, and clerks and other persons not allowed by the order, are to be turned into the <rs>Quartermasters Department</rs>, under penalty of impressment of the animal and charges against the offender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> There are many officers in the army who keep more horses than the regulations allow, and many persons who keep horses at the public expense who are not entitled to have any. Indeed, the necessity of the order will be apparent upon the statement of a single fact within my own knowledge, viz: That a detailed man in <num value="1">one</num> of the departments mentioned above keeps <num value="3">three</num> horses, and yet is not entitled to keep <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If the order had gone further, and cut down the allowance of mounted men at division headquarters to half a dozen couriers, it would have been all the better. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Since the subject has been alluded to in the public prints there can be no impropriety in stating that <persName n="Cheatham,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-Generals</roleName> <surname>Cheatham</surname></persName> and <persName n="Buckner,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General"></roleName><surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Forrest,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, have been relieved of their commands in this army at their own request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is said that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> had recommended an extension of the command of <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> at a time when the latter was promoting a movement to have him removed from the command of this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is not improbable that <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> will reconsider his application and return to his former command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In the meantime <persName n="Wharton,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Wharton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-Generals</roleName> <surname>Wharton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Martin,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Martin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General"></roleName><surname>Martin</surname></persName>, who were content to remain at their posts and discharge their duty in the positions in which the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> thought they could be most useful, have been promoted and made <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major Generals</rs> of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName n="Hill,General,D.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, I understand, was ordered to report at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> at the <name>Instance</name> of the <rs>President</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> These are all meritorious officers; and yet I must be permitted to express the hope, without reference to particular individuals, however, that all our officers will yet discover that they will best subserve their own interest, and the good of the country, the less they think about themselves and the more faithfully they labor, in whatsoever position they may be placed, to carry forward the great cause which engages all our efforts and affections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> It may not be improper to add here, in correction of a prevalent error, that only <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs> out of <num value="11">eleven</num> in this army united in the written application for a change in the command of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, and that <num value="1">one</num> of these, upon fuller information, expressed his regret that he had done so. The application was never presented to the <rs>President</rs>, but was suppressed as soon as it was discovered that only a few officers regarded it with favor. </p> 
<p>

<head>Chivalry and <orgName n="Common Sense" type="newspaper">Common Sense</orgName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> A great deal has been said about the chivalry of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and it has been nobly illustrated in the defence of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But there is another quality of the people of that State for which they have not so much credit, and which nevertheless they have exhibited prominently in the manner in which <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> has been defended, and that is their common sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We have remarked before that it is a general mistake to consider the <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> an impulsive people, who wear their hearts upon their sleeves, and rush headlong into difficulties without looking at the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>On the contrary, they are eminently sagacious and practical, not often taking strangers upon trust, adapting the means wisely to the end, and steady and persistent in the pursuit of their purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> assert that they have been bent upon disunion for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. We think it highly probable, and no other fact is needed to establish their wisdom and sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They have understood the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from the beginning, and, whilst other States have comforted themselves with the velvet softness of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> contact, they have always maintained that there was the claw of a tiger beneath.--They have never failed, whilst obeying the injunction to be &#x0022;harmless as doves,&#x0022; to be &#x0022;wise as serpents,&#x0022; and have therefore long foreseen the present state of things, and prepared themselves as far as possible for the inevitable catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>And when at last it came, the precautions for the security of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> were just what the occasion demanded, and placed that city in a better condition for the collision than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with all its power, was for assault.--They did not leave a good cause to take care of itself; they did not expect that the angels would descend from above and drive the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from the harbor; but they acted upon the maxim of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, to &#x0022;trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and keep your powder dry. &#x0022; They acted upon the principle that &#x0022;faith without works is dead,&#x0022; and that the <name>Gods</name> help them who help themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The consequence was that they shelled <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> out of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, and that, when they had him out, they have placed the same fortress in such a condition that it has resisted a siege of more than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> by the most powerful armaments under the sun. And yet <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is only <num value="1">one</num> of a mighty cordon of defences which encircles the <rs type="place">Palmetto city</rs>, and each of which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will have to pummel to powder before the coveted jewel falls into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Nothing has been left in the measures for the defence of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> to chance or accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>They might have relied in a measure upon their natural allies &mdash; the burning sun and the yellow fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>But they did not, and events have proved it well that they did not. If the sun roasted the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> out, or if the plague decimated them, well and good; but they went on fortifying and placing guns in position and defending every vulnerable point, just as if their sun was always temperate and comfortable, and the pestilence a thing unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We hear of no surprises in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The Confederate soldiers in that neighborhood sleep with both eyes open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>They always suspect <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>They always remember that if the good man of the house had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched; and not knowing at what hour the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> come, they watch all hours, knowing them to be the most sly, and subtle, and devilish of all created animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The consequence is, that when <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>, in his profound secretiveness, creeps up some dark midnight to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, thinking our &#x0022;impulsive Southern brethren,&#x0022; in the generous confidence of their ardent natures, are taking a sweet snooze, he suddenly receives such a buffet between the eyes as makes him see more stars than glitter on his beloved gridiron, and he goes back to his ships a sadder and a wiser man. These people are profoundly in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondent complains that in some business intercourse, under a flag of truce, between the <rs>Southern</rs> and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers in the harbor, the <rs>Confederates</rs> were cold and haughty in their manners, never responding beyond the most frigid civility to the fine social overtures which <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> is pleased to make when not engaged in choking and stabbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>We are glad to hear it.--We are not engaged in child's play with these invaders of their homes, and murderers of their children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>They appreciate the profound reality and solemnity of this struggle, and they hate the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> with the hate of the heart as well as the lips and understanding. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> Nothing could have been more appropriate, as well as judicious, than that <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> should have, the chieftainship of the defenders of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He was their deliverer at the beginning of the war; he will continue, we trust, their deliverer to its close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>He is a man very much like themselves; warm of heart, but cool of head, strong of hand and always suspicious of their peculiar enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>He is not a man noisy and abusive of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but he has made them the study of his life; he appreciates their energy, perseverance, and fertility of resources, and comprehends quite as thoroughly their deplorable lack of principle, conscience, and honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>He never trusts them; never goes to sleep while there are <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> about; never trusts his lambs to a sudden incursion of these wolves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Some time ago the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, in the exuberance of their idiot joy upon getting <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName> &mdash; an event which they hailed as the immediate precursor of the downfall of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> &mdash; pronounced <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> a humbug.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Perhaps they intended that as a compliment, but they must acknowledge by this time that he did not deserve it. Their occupation of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName> he had not the means of preventing without leaving unguarded a more direct avenue to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>He chose the less of <num value="2">two</num> evils, and the result has vindicated the wisdom of his judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Even if they lay <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> in ashes they can never plant their banner in triumph upon its soil.
