<head>The crisis and its demands upon us.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> The next fortnight will in all probability witness a series of important battles in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and along the line of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.--The fortunes of war are proverbially uncertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>A more accident may convert victory into Defant; the loss of a single man may loss a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Much depends upon the courage and steadiness of troops, much upon the forethought and address of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>; but after all a great deal depends upon accident and chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The leading feature of the war in which we are engaged is the fact that the troops on both sides are raw and inexperienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Few on either side have been under fire, and a defeat is more than apt to prove a disaster to <num value="1">one</num> or the other side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> There is no doubt of the fact, too, that the enemy outnumbers us in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and they have a great advantage over us in the quality of their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Unless we can get at them with the bayonet, this disparity in arms is greater than we have any conception of. We believe that the superior prowess and endurance of our soldiers more than compensate these disadvantages; but an untoward accident or unlucky chance may happen to the most brave and resolute, and throw them into panic. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> It becomes us, therefore, to be prepared for unfavorable news, as well as good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We can not expect to fight through a war, of the proportions of this <num value="1">one</num>, with uninterrupted success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It is well to cherish confidence in our star, but not to an extent to incapacitate us for enduring reverse and discomfiture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>An occasional defeat even conduces to our permanent triumph, by nerving us to duty and teaching that reliance upon exertion, which we are too apt to lose amid continued success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> We do not anticipate misfortune in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>; but inasmuch as reverses may happen to all, it is meet that we should contemplate the possibility of their occurrence in our case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>War is at best a lottery, in which there are many blanks and few prizes; and it would be as unphilosophical as unmanly to so exalt our imagination with expectations of fortune as to be unable to encounter disappointment with composure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The safest sentiment in times of war is that of constant wariness and apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The most fatal blunder into which a combatant can fall is that of depreciating an adversary, and treating lightly and with in difference a serious crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>If the <rs>South</rs> were but thoroughly alarmed for her safety, she would be absolutely unconquerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>We spoke the other day of the wholesome effect upon the enemy of the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>; the effect upon ourselves has been as injurious to our cause as upon the enemy it was beneficial, by relieving us of that salutary alarm which in fact provided the victorious army and gave us the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>If the enemy should succeed in gaining advantages in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, unless they put him in positions permanently hurtful to us and impregnable, the result in the end would be favorable to us. We should be roused from the lethargy that has come over us; and we should be startled from the game of busy self-seeking in which we are enlisted into a sense of the necessity of sacrificing more to the common cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> That it is the interest of the <rs>South</rs> to fight this war through to the bitter end admits of no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The enormous war debt of the <rs>North</rs> would crush us entirely if any portion of the taxation it will entail should fall upon the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The great object of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> now is to get possession of the <rs>South</rs>, and by wholesale confiscations build up a fund to discharge their debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>They have shown in the past history of this war that in this work of plunder they will pay little regard to the distinctions between Union men and Secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Their object is plunder, and it is property they are after without regard to ownership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Those regions of the <rs>South</rs> have suffered most severely which have by divisions among their populations invited the enemy in. The fact is that we are all embarked in <num value="1">one</num> adventure upon <num value="1">one</num> bottom, and, whether <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> or Secessionists, are all to share alike the advantages of success or the woes of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We are fighting against the tax gatherer and the courts of confiscation; we are fighting for property, independence, and honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> A few reverses under these circumstances would prove of infinite service to us. They would nerve us to exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>They would reawaken the fires of patriotism which brought out so many volunteers and so many noble popular contributions last summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Let us all awaken to a new sense of the necessity for activity and of the duties required of us by the crisis. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> There is no doubt that the present blockade has its inconveniences, and, in some respects, serious disadvantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We are by means disposed to close our eyes to them, nor to underrate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It is no consolation that foreign nations, by permitting this obstruction to a commerce in which so many <num value="1000000">millions</num> of the Old World are interested, are inflicting an injury and loss upon their own subjects greater than that which we ourselves suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>We all know and feel that if the blockade were opened, the war might last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> without exhausting the resources or endangering any vital part of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>But, conceding the value of open ports in some most important respects to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, there are advantages flowing from the present state of things which are equally undeniable, and which must prove of more value in the end than any <num value="1">one</num> could gain by immediate and unobstructed commerce with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> The South has been reduced to a state of dependence and <unclear>varsalage</unclear> as much by what it has not done, as by what has been done by its enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It has been endowed by nature with a soil, eliminate, and productions unrivalled in any other part of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Agriculture has been its only vocation, and agriculture, by means of its domestic institutions, guided by its own superior intelligence and experience, has yielded with ease returns such as have rarely flowed from the cultivation of the soil in any other portion of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It is true that the great bulk of the wealth flowing from its products has gone to enrich Northern capitalists and commerce; built upon not only <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> but <name>English</name> towns, and covered every seas with sailing vessels and steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>But enough has been left to enable the proprietors of the soil to live in ease with little exertion, and have abundant leisure for intellectual cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>There has been no pressing and palpable motive to that diversified industry which is, after all, the life-blood of national growth and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>That the <rs>South</rs> has the essential genius and energy for the development in every form of activity of her vesture, sources, and for encase in every department of enterprise, is shown by the brilliant triumphs she has achieved upon a national theatre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>When the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> reproach the people of the <rs>South</rs> with indolence and self-indulgence, they showed their own shallowness of observation and inability to comprehend the true philosophy of the <rs>Southern</rs> character.--If a little of the energy which the <rs>South</rs> has devoted to the politics and arms of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has been employed in commercial and <unclear></unclear> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> We have some further particulars this morning relative to our disaster in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>They remove all doubt of the death of <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00307" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>The battle was brought on by our forces, who attacked the enemy under the apprehension that his force was greatly less than it really was. Notwithstanding the mistake, our men evidently fought bravely; for besides losing their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is command, their <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>, <num value="4">four</num> of their <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>, <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Majors</rs>, and <num value="3">three</num> Surgeons were wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/> The retreat, which it appears was well defended, was commanded by <persName n="Carroll,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00308" reg="mostcommon:Carroll,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Carroll</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>It will be seen that the loss on our side is not so large as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> account on our side represented it to be. The Northern statement and that last received come more nearly agreeing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/> The error made by our Commanders is a strange <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>To attack a fortified army under the impression that it numbered only <num value="1500">1,500</num>, when it was <num value="14000">14,000</num> strong, is a remarkable error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>To underrate the enemy in this manner is singular enough, and to fight under such a misapprehension could not but last to disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The sharp winds of a stormy interval of weather on a very dangerous coast must have occasioned some peril, if not some disasters, for it.--There would be no tears shed in this part of the world if the disasters were the greatest that ever befell such an armed force upon the seas. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>But it is so far from being certain that point was selected by the enemy, that it may now be rather believed that a more southern field is that chosen for the threatened demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/><placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> has been suggested, with much plausibility, as the point for which it took its departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The entrance into <placeName reg="Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, United States" key="tgn,1115016">Pamlico</placeName>, in that case, was merely to escape the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>If <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> is the object of the grand naval preparation, employment will be given to a very able and gallant officer and a well disciplined and brave army under him, that have been a long time waiting anxiously for the appearance of the enemy some way or other.
