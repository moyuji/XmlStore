<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>probable collapse of the great rebellion at an early period thereafter, there was comparatively little danger of any such extraordinary panic in monetary circles as that which has occurred since our last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>But, with the retrograde movement of that army and its attendant disasters, it at once became evident that the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, if not problematical, was, at least, indefinitely put off, and rendered exceedingly improbable for some time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>These facts dispelled the fatal illusion under which the country had for so long a time been resting, and, combined with the fears of foreign interference in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs, which they have engendered, resulted in the extraordinary excitement in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> and environs, above referred to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> But the great advance in <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> and foreign exchange &mdash; or rather the depreciation in paper money &mdash; is more directly traceable to the recent enactment of the <rs>Treasury Note Bill</rs>, against the remonstrances of a united public, proclaimed through the columns of an almost undivided press; for seldom, if ever, has the press been so unanimous against any public measure as it was against the passage of the bill conferring such great powers upon the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>We learn that it is by many considered exceedingly doubtful if <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> will use his power by issuing any more demand notes; but, if this be true, in view of the extraordinary and deplorable condition of affairs now existing, and the still more unfavorable prospects, we conceive it to be the duty of the <rs>Secretary</rs> to inform the public in regard to his determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>If, however, he shall conclude to issue more demand notes, the circulation of bank notes should be reduced in like ratio, as this alone would probably save the country from the evils which it is beginning to experience, and which are attributable directly to the passage of the demand note bill, the crisis having only been deferred for a brief season by the general belief that the war was about to be brought to a close by a splendid <hi rend="italics">coup</hi> of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>There is a limit in the issue of paper, beyond which it is dangerous to advance, and it is now evident that this limit has already been reached, if not passed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> Rarely has the spirit of speculation run so high in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> as during the past <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, and though the belief that there is a scarcity of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> is simply chimerical, yet it exists in a great degree, nevertheless, and the enormous premiums which have been paid for specie and its equivalent by speculators, has gone far towards confirming it. So great has the evil already become, that it is impossible to obtain change anywhere except by patronizing the brokers and paying the enormous premiums which they demand.--Various are the attributed causes for these evils, but the true and only cause is to be found in the past and prospective excessive issues of paper currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Were it not for this, it is undoubted that <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> would to-day have been quoted at par, and with no prospect of being any higher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>This is certainly a fit subject for <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s thoughtful contemplation, and we trust that he will hesitate long before taking so evidently fatal a step as the further issuing of any considerable amount of demand notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The public mind has become completely unsettled, and it is the firm conviction of many people, who make finance their chief study, that the country is fast drifting into a state as much worse than that it is now experiencing as the existing state of affairs is worse than that which prevailed previous to the enactment of the last Demand Note law. </p> </div4>
