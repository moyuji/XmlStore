<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They accordingly evacuated the cars, and rapidly gathering on the street north of the depot, formed in line and prepared to make the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Just before the movement was made from the cars, a large crowd of persons went down <address><street n="President street">President street</street></address> with a Southern flag, and met the troops as they emerged from the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>The soles of the feet, even in their thickest and most sensitive parts, have been studded with those ungainly annoyances; but the little toe is generally found to be their favorite position &mdash; a large portion of it is frequently diseased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The outer joint of the great toe appears, also, to be frequently infested with these excrescences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>These are the more ordinary cases which present themselves to the practitioner, and are those which give great annoyance without probably exciting that excruciating agony which is felt when they appear in other places.--They are found under the nail of the great toe and these are the sources of much irritation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>But there are other positions which they assume, and which are the source of extreme misery to those who have the misfortune to suffer from them.--For instance, the inner portion of the little toe, close to the nail, has been the fruitful cause of such a morbid condition that the whole frame has partaken of it, and I have had occasion to relieve an apparently broken down constitution by means so simple, yet so efficacious as to be looked upon rather as a ministering angel than as an ordinary observer of the effect which may spring from the humblest means. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/> The roots of the nails have been occasionally the seats of corns, which have produced a high degree of inflammation and tumefication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>These have been ascribed to accidents &mdash; nay, to gouty diathesis, while the original cause has been overlooked, because little or no pain has attended their development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The <num value="3">three</num> small toes are indiscriminately diseased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Some persons exhibit a peculiar idiosyncrasy in this respect, and in families there will be found a striking predisposition to an unhealthy state in this portion of the integuments of the foot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> The soles of the feet and the heels often exhibit excrescences, varying in the intensity of the symptoms they display &mdash; sometimes only those of annoyance, in others of actual pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>I will not enter minutely into the appearances which have been presented to me during my extensive practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea which naturally suggests itself to those who are suffering from any kind of pain, is instantaneous relief, and many are most willing to allow the <q> &#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">lous et origo mali</hi></foreign>&#x0022;</q> to remain, and again to become the fruitful offspring of pain, rather than apply to a skillful operator, even though he can permanently eradicate the dangerous nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>In the cure of a disordered state of the feet, we must oftentimes devote as much attention to the means of palliation as to those of cure, and we shall find that we often gain as much reputation from the public, and estimation in the eyes of our patients by affording them momentary ease, as by the ultimate cure of the disease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/> On the other hand, the confidence of the public is so much abused by a class of self-educated and self-extolling practitioners, who pretend to have discovered infallible means of preventing diseases such as we have described, that innumerable difficulties surround the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Specifics for all the ills of life are discovered daily and hourly, if the public press is to be taken as our guide; but among the advertisements will be found the bold assertions of some loud proclaimer of his power, and especially in the department to which I have devoted my time and attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Plasters, ointments, liniments, and lotions, are all brought before the astonished world as possessing powers infallible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The maker of these nostrums wraps in becoming mystery his discovery; he obtains a patent for it, signs his own autograph on the stamps; there is necromancy, <sic>withcraft</sic> and marvellous power in everything he propounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>According to his own assertions he has never been known to fail; and what chance has he who has devoted his whole life to inquiry, but honestly to confess that the deviations of nature surpass his expectations, that her ways are too often inscrutable, and all that he can do is to study, to learn and to try to cure, without professing that every malady is subject to his superior skill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/> Most urgently do I recommend those who are afflicted with corns &mdash; however harmless they may appear &mdash; however easily removed &mdash; never to have recourse to the knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>They may be assured that, though there may be a vast number of instances in which no bad consequence has attended upon this operation--(a man may jump into the water and not be drowned,) --yet there are so many, and such serious evils which have arisen from it, that no <num value="1">one</num> who has regard for his own comfort and safety should venture upon it. <num value="1">One</num> sad termination outweighs a whole catalogue of fortunate extirpations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>I strenuously recommend those who, suffering from corns, are anxious for relief, never to have recourse to the pen knife, to the razer, or to the scissors, but to place themselves as soon as possible under the management of some <num value="1">one</num> who has been long skilled in their cure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> They will find temporary and sometimes permanent relief, if the affection be but commencing, from plunging the foot into a hot pediluvium, pouring in from time to time hot water, and keeping the diseased part steadily immersed for at least an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The foot should then be assiduously rubbed for a considerable length of time with a dry, rough towel; the friction need not be confined to the immediate surface of the corn, but rather on the integument immediately in contact with it. In the greater number of instances this process will be followed by the loosening of the callous substance; there will be neither pain nor uneasiness left; sleep will be uninterrupted by any disagreeable sensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Although the corn will remain, still relief is obtained, without the danger which cutting may produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>It is impossible to be completely rid of a corn, unless extirpated by a skillful and experienced operator. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/> I have before observed, never should the apparently simple appearance of a hard corn, or <q> &#x0022;clavus durus,&#x0022;</q> lead to the use of a knife by a patient, for, although there may be nothing from which a result could be anticipated &mdash; no external characteristics which give the least indications that evil will be the consequence of a meddle-some practice &mdash; yet the most serious consequences may result therefrom; and when too late there will be cause for the deepest regret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>If I appear somewhat tedious in this matter &mdash; if I have been guilty of repetitions &mdash; I trust that I may be excused for my earnestness, and an anxiety on a subject of which I conceive of more importance, almost, than any rules I could lay down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>It is a maxim I would have a starting taught to repeat &mdash; it is a sentence which should be repeated in the ear of every sufferer from corns &mdash; it is a voice which should be echoed back on every occasion--<q>&#x0022;do not use A knife.&#x0022;</q> if, after such a warning, there should be any sufficiently venturesome to neglect it, the danger be on his own head, but the repentance will come too late. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> The most appalling spasms, convulsions terrible to behold, and lockjaw, have attended on the wounding a branch of a nerve by a common pen knife, as also hemorrhage, scarcely to be arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>I am not fond of giving cases, for I am sorry to find that every empyric who practices any branch of the medical profession fancies that the true avenue to employment is to narrate extraordinary cases, whether founded on fact or not, because he fancies that people will see something in what they read which may remind them of their own suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>I will only allude to the death of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Daruly</foreName></persName> by wounding a nerve on his great toe, and also to the case referred to in the memoirs of the <rs>Duchess</rs> d' abrantes; it will be seen at the end of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>I could refer to a vast number of examples which I have encountered during my short stay here, if I thought it necessary to add to the testimony which I here bear to the sad result of using the knife. </p>
