<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> <date value="12-02">The 2d of December</date> is a famous day in <name>French</name> history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>On this day, exactly <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> ago, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> was crowned <rs type="role2">Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> by the <rs>Pope</rs>, who had come all the way from <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> to perform that office; a thing that the world, so far as we know, had not witnessed since the coronation of Chestermagne, whose iron crown <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> <unclear></unclear>, as he said, in a gutter, and put upon his own head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is remarkable that after all, the <rs>Holy Father</rs> did not <unclear></unclear> the crown on his head; for, with the natural impatience of his temper, he became tired of the preliminary ceremony, and, snatching the crown from the hand of the <rs>Pope</rs>, clapped it on his head, exclaiming. &#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> gives it to me; woe to him that touches it!&#x0022; This was the day that <persName><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>selected for the <unclear></unclear> which made him <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>So that the <date value="12-02">2d of December</date> was already memorable enough, when in <unclear></unclear> rendered still more so by the mention of <persName n="Brown,,Old John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="default:Brown,Old John,,,"><foreName>Old John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> We remember that day well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Though not present at the execution, we were at <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>, with <num value="1000">thousands</num> of others; and the events of that day, and of the week that had preceded it, will never fade from our memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We shall not forget that we <hi rend="italics">must</hi> then have seen <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, for the <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName> to which we were attached had the building in which were the headquarters of the <name>Cadets</name> for a guard-room, and we saw all the officers, of whom he was <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>But he was then unknown to fame, or at least not so well known as to make him an object of especial curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>We may even have conversed with him, for we believe we had something to say to all the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>But if we saw him and conversed with him, we did not know his name, and took no more notice of him than we should have taken of any casual acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Could we have lifted up the cover of the very near future and taken a peep at the man through its medium, how different would it have been!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>There we saw old <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> martyr &mdash; the horse-thief and murderer, as we regarded him &mdash; a low, snuffling <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vagabond as ever we saw &mdash; with no more of the hero or the martyr about him than any <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pedlar you may pick up in a summer's day. The zeal which all Yankeedom manifested in favor of this ruffianly scoundrel, and the eagerness with which they sought to sanctify his crime &mdash; that of willful and deliberate murder &mdash; is eminently characteristic of that amiable nation, betraying an entire destitution of what <persName n="Locke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Locke,nomatch:0"><surname>Locke</surname></persName> calls the &#x0022;Moral Sense&#x0022;--that is, the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>They instated upon it that he was guilty of no crime, inasmuch as he only slew a few slaveholders, under the conviction that he was doing right, and argued to prove that <hi rend="italics">it could not</hi> be wrong to slay a slaveholder, addressing their arguments to the <rs>Governor</rs> of a State in which there were <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> slaves.--They said, in effect, &#x0022;<persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>, you and your slaveholding constituents are a pack of scoundrels, who deserve to be put to death every day of your lives, and you ought not to hang this saint, who merely did what you know it was his duty to do.&#x0022; Unfortunately for <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>, the <rs>Governor</rs> did not allow the force of this reasoning, and so <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> was hung; and that was the beginning of this war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> We say we shall never forget the day that <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> was hung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the most lovely days that ever came from heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It was as mild as though it were the middle of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>; and it might well have passed for such, had it not been that the trees were bare of foliage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>But <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, as time is counted, have passed since that memorable day. And yet the events of a whole century have been compressed into that little space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>When we look back upon that day, over the <num value="5">five</num> intervening years, we can scarcely realize the fact that we are the same person, that this is the same country, and that the objects most familiar to us are, in reality, the same objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>It all seems &#x0022;like a phantasma or a hideous dream.&#x0022; We had all, then, read of war, and had heard of war; but how few of us had any conception of what it really was!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>We had heard old people talk of the trials and troubles of the old Revolution, and their juniors eloquent on the subject of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war. But the most lively imagination had never formed a conception of the gigantic struggle of which that day's work was the opening scene. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
