<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/><num value="1300000">1,300,000</num> of the flower of her manhood having been already brought into the field, this exhaustion of her resources in men available for military service is not to be wondered at even though considerations of industrial production had not already come in to establish the fact more forcibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Assuming, however, that the draft now spoken of by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s agents be carried out to the fullest extent, the experience of last year's conscription shows that it will not yield over <num value="144000">144,000</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> Industrial considerations appear to forbid the extension of the conscription now proposed to all the manhood fit for military duty within &#x0022;the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022; The deficit in last year's crop of wheat at the <rs>North</rs> amounted, it appears, to the enormous quantity of <num value="16000000">16,000,000</num> of bushels.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> This fact will increase desertion, and tend further to reduce the actual results of the &#x0022;draft&#x0022; by throwing many cases that take place under the head of &#x0022;substitutions,&#x0022; in the present returns of <persName n="Fry,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Fry</surname></persName>, under the head of &#x0022;commutations.&#x0022;--The fact that <num value="90000">90,000</num> men succeeded in cheating the last conscription of victims by refusing to &#x0022;report,&#x0022; shows a state of public opinion which, in a thinly settled country, with mountains, forests, and swamps, offers quite as safe a means as commutation or substitution for slipping through the meshes of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s net.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>In order to follow out the subject in connection with that officer's figures I will repeat here that those conscripts added nothing whatever to the <rs>Federal</rs> strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>They sat over their camp fires in sullen groups away from the older soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>They regarded the volunteers around them with the hate attaching to the instruments of an obnoxious compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>They were never allowed to go outside the rear camp pickets; and were in fact constantly under surveillance or guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>To prevent their desertion in the hour of battle they were placed in its very front.--Of all this there can be no doubt; and the conclusion is therefore irresistible that the conscription of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> added nothing in fact to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s strength in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> The dogged spirit of last years conscripts was, however, not merely passive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It took form, naturally, in desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Having been in the <rs>Federal</rs> rear for nearly <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, up to the end of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, I employed, during that time, frequent opportunities of mingling in the constant stream of conscripts returning without his consent from the <orgName>army of <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The breadth of my inquiries satiety me that those figures present a fair <unclear></unclear> of generalization touching <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> the working of the &#x0022;draft;&#x0022; and I therefore conclude that, of the <num value="50000">50,000</num> men which <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> says it contributed to the army, the number remaining in the field on the <date value="11-01">1st of November</date> last did not exceed <num value="8000">eight thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Fewer still may be reasonably supposed to remain there now.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> There is a bid before the <name>Senate</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to make <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>, which are worth at this moment about <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> in the dollar, a legal tender in payment of all debts incurred prior to the secession of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>We can hardly bring ourselves to believe the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Nevertheless, it is certainly so, monstrous as it may be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> Let us see how the thing will work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>A man in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> buys an estate of a <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure>, at <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> an acre, and gives his bond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Secession takes place, and the law prohibiting the collection of debts during present troubles sets him at ease with regard to his payments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>In the mean time, he happens to have in his possession <measure n="10barrels" type="mass">ten barrels</measure> of whiskey, which he can sell at <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> a barrel, Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>He sells this whiskey and with the proceeds pays for the estate.--The money which he pays being worth, at present, about <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> in the dollar, he gets the estate for <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>; that is to say, for half a dollar an acre, whereas he promised to pay <num value="15">fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The man who holds the estate has no option.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>He must take this money or nothing, for the proposed law makes it a legal tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Is it possible that a <orgName n="Virginia Senate" type="senate">Virginia Senate</orgName> can mean to encourage such a fraud as this by giving it the sanction of law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Yet this is the inevitable consequence of such a law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> The committee who reported this bill, we have no doubt acted with good intentions.--They believed that they were taking an important step in the right direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>They thought that to make the existing currency a legal tender was to arrest the progress of deprecation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The slightest recurrence to examples of world wide notoriety would have convinced them of their mistake.--Congress, itself, about <num value="1">one</num> year ago, passed a law equivalent in its operation to a legal tender law. It taxed, in the hands of the holder, all evidences of indebtedness in payment of which he refused to receive the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency, and that so exorbitantly that in a very few years the tax will consume principal and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>This most iniquitous law has inflicted vast injury on many creditors who had already been debarred the privilege of collecting their debts in the usual way, until after the war, and who certainly are as much entitled to the protection of the <name>Legislature</name> as other classes of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>But has it had the slightest effect in delaying, even for a moment, the downhill march of the <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Look at the actual facts of the ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>This time last year the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency was about <num value="7">7</num> or <num value="8">8</num> to <num value="1">one</num>. <measure n="3weeks" type="date">Three weeks</measure> ago it was <num value="20">20</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>This day it is <num value="30">30</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, and who can tell what it will be a month hence, if Congress do not arrest it in its precipitate career by stopping <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>'s machine, and passing stringent laws to compel the funding of outstanding notes? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> This was not a new question, even when Congress passed this law. It had been thoroughly tested <measure n="170years" type="date">170 years</measure> before in the then colony of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, which issued a number of bills of credit, and after securing, as they thought, their currency at <hi rend="italics">par,</hi> by heavy penalties upon those who refused to take them, proceeded to declare them legal tender by law. A great number of persons were swindled out of their just dues, but the law did not arrest the depreciation for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> colonies followed the example of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, with exactly the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/><placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> tried it; but, like the <rs>Northern States</rs>, they failed altogether to prevent depreciation by penal laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>In <num value="10">ten</num> different instances, therefore, it had been tried in the colonies, when the <name>Revolution</name> had the folly to try it once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>And there was the most signal failure of all. The Revolutionary Congress affixed to the refusal to take the continental paper at <hi rend="italics">par</hi> the most frightful penalties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The person so offending was declared to be guilty of treason, was made liable to the punishment of that crime, was declared to be out of the pale of the law. --Yet in a year after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> notes were issued they began to decline.
