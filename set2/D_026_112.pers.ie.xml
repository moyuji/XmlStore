<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> When I left with the crowd I got away by a blind passage to the river, and went back to <placeName reg="Westminster, Carroll, Maryland" key="tgn,2049138">Westminster</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It was a glorious day and a glorious sight that how greet, my eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The magnificent <rs>Westminster Hall</rs>, which borders on the river, lined up its superb towers; but now every lower and turret was alive with human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The bridge itself, the finest, doubtless in the world, was lined with human beings waiting for the same procession.--From this point up to Charring Cross was <num value="1">one</num> mass of human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>At Charring Cross the <rs>Nelson</rs> column rose into the air out of a pediment formed of human faces up to the smooth column itself.--The equestrian statue of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> I was similarly covered &mdash; a chimney sweep on top amusing the crowd by standing behind the statue and placing the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> colors now on the statue's head, now on his own, placing his dusty cap on the head of the poor <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The sweep received the plaudits accorded him with great solemnity, bowing graciously on each side, and waving his hand with the dignity of an opera singer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>From this point I looked in every direction, and saw a multitude that no man could number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Every <rs n="Gas Light" type="newspaper">gas light</rs>, signboard, balcony, house-top, door step, window, presented to the eye only a mighty efflorescence of human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>And not less remarkable was the good order preserved by these masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The last crowd I had seen was that which had assembled to witness the execution of the pirates of the <rs>Flowery Land</rs> at Newgate &mdash; a mass of bloated and sottish thieves and prostitutes.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> Slowly the procession crept by us, for the people miles off were blocking the way to cheer the hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>As the banners passed I interested myself in observing the immense number of Societies, Unions, Clubs, &#x0026;c., whose existence was indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Societies passed with all sorts and kinds of symbols &mdash; suns, moons, stars, ladders, fishes, implements, tools, birds, beasts, men, women, <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, <persName n="Peel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Peel,nomatch:0"><surname>Peel</surname></persName>, <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>, <rs type="role" n="Queen">Queens</rs>, all these, amid showers of symbols, passed by on flags whose age announced that they were societies of long standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>But, alas for the teetotalers, only <num value="1">one</num> poor little temperance flag passed, and that, I am bound to say, was greeted with loud and real laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If the total abstinence folks in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> wish to succeed, they will have to make friends with the poor man's beer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>However, I should add that during the whole day I saw neither drunken man or woman, except at <num value="1">one</num> point, a public house, where some low <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> had gathered and were swearing what they would do with <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> How long the procession was, and how slowly it had to move, may be judged by the fact that, though it started at about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> from <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms, not quite <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> from Charring</placeName> Cross, it was <time value="7:30">half-past 7</time> when the <rs>General</rs> passed this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The people climbed up <num value="1">one</num> upon the other to catch a glimpse of him, and as he passed through it was as if a great living sea piled up its waves in walls on each side of his chariot.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, so fertile in excuses for their outrages in this war, very readily invented the application of the term &#x0022;contrabands&#x0022; to Southern slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They determined to take the step of stealing these slaves from their owners, to whom the ancestors of these same <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> sold the slaves aforesaid; and in order that the stealing might have somewhat the semblance of order and authority, they declared the slaves &#x0022;contrabands,&#x0022; and it was further declared unlawful to return them to their owners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> It is remarkable, however, that even after they are taken from their homes and their masters &mdash; after they are enjoying association and such freedom as they have among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--they are still called &#x0022;contrabands.&#x0022; A cannon is &#x0022;contraband of war&#x0022; in its route to the enemy's ports; but if it is captured, and put in use by the captor, it is no longer contraband to him. The poor negro, however, has a different fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He is still a doomed &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; The name sticks to him as a term of derision, after he causes to be, under the authority of such law as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have for him, a &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; Yet this is not all; he continues in <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> and practice a &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; He is not allowed his promised equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>His <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> master denies him the privileges of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>He subjects him to indignities and menial service, and if he adorns him with a uniform, and puts a gun in his hand, it is only that he may become a breastwork to shield the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from Confederate bullets; or to be the minister of some barbarities, which his ignorance of the usages of war, and his rude instincts and passions, very well fit him for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> We have seen enough in this war to know what a cruel, selfish, and malignant spirit it is that controls the people of the <rs>North</rs>, in their measures relating to the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>They care nothing for him. They only use him to injure us, and thus gratify their malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They have no mercy for him, and will throw him off to seek his home and livelihood as he may.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Indeed, to subject him to rigors he had never known when under his lawful master's authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Every &#x0022;contraband&#x0022; (thus the order styles them,) is required immediately to hire himself or herself to a master, and to sojourn under that master's roof and nowhere else, the master or hirer being required to become responsible for the contraband he so employs.
