<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> We have always believed, and we have repeatedly expressed the belief, that the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, having swamped the <rs>Government</rs> in the consequences of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> policy, would ultimately conclude peace on the basis of a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, if the people should not seasonably interpose at the ballot box.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> These facts, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> corresponding ones, viewed in relation with the general fact that the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> leaders hate slavery more than they love the <rs>Union</rs>, and love power even more than they hate slavery, put the justness of the belief in question beyond a reasonable doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> leaders are ready to make peace on the basis of a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> just so soon as they come to believe that they cannot execute their schemes of arbitrary and irresponsible subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They propose to subjugate the <rs>Southern</rs> people not to the <rs>Constitution</rs> but to the will of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>; and whenever they become satisfied that this is impracticable they will have no further use and no room for the <rs>Southern</rs> people in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>They will at once acknowledge their independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> Some of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> leaders have already reached or well-night reached this point, and are training accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The views he presents concerning the nature and tendency of civil war surely deserves the very gravest consideration; we by no means would have them passed by lightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>They are indeed of tremendous moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>But they do not enforce the necessity of acknowledging the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, which in all human probability would render civil war the normal state of this continent, nor yet the necessity of abolishing slavery by a constitutional amendment; on the contrary, they enforce the necessity of restoring the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and to that end the necessity of requiring the people in rebellion to submit alone to the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it is, and of waging the war distinctly to compel such submission and for no other purpose what ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>This is the true lesson of the historical retrospect he takes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>But this is not the lesson he draws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>He reads in the retrospect a warrant only for the abolition of slavery by a Constitutional amendment, or for the acknowledgment of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, of which the former according to his own admissions, would necessitate the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> &#x0022;The rebels,&#x0022; he says, in a preceding part of his speech, &#x0022;declare that slavery cannot longer exist under our Government; that the <num value="2">two</num> things, slavery and the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> have become incompatible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>In this alleged belief was found the motive for secession, and in it to-day consists the strength of secession.&#x0022; This is undoubtedly true; whence it follows that to justify and fix the belief through the <name>Abolition</name> of slavery by a constitutional amendment would be to strengthen the strength of secession, and consequently to bring the case at once within the conditions which <persName n="Henderson,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Henderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Henderson</surname></persName> regards as warranting the acknowledgment of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>On the other hand, it follows as clearly that to remove the belief in question, by throwing open the doors of the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it is to the <rs>Southern</rs> people, would be to paralyze the strength of secession, and consequently to secure at an early day the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The truth is, however, that the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> do not want the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and they will not have it, if they can get rid of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The Federal accounts, which are most boastful, contain admissions fatal to their boasting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>For instance, <num value="1">one</num> of their latest telegrams claims a victory by <persName n="Smith,General,A.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="default:Smith,A.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, who came to the relief of <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, (who had been whipped on the <dateStruct value="--8"><day reg="2">8th</day></dateStruct>,) and falling upon the rebels on the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="2">9th</day></dateStruct>, badly whipped them, &#x0022;taking <measure n="2000" type="prisoners">two thousand prisoners</measure> and <num value="18">eighteen</num> guns.&#x0022; [They confess a loss of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> all they had in the fight of the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>.] Yet the same paragraph adds: &#x0022;The expedition is no doubt broken up, and our troops are falling back.&#x0022; All of the accounts, though claiming to have inflicted dreadful punishment on the rebels, yet admit heavy losses, and represent the battles to have been most bloody. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> There were several engagements no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It is clear that the enemy was worsted terribly in the long run, and is put upon the long run back to whence he came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He advanced with a force of <num value="40000">40,000</num> men and a formidable fleet, under the thundering <persName n="Porter,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Such forces and armaments were to sweep the much ridiculed <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> under <persName n="Smith,,Kirby,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> and his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> like cobwebs from their path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The confessed failure of the expedition settles the question &mdash; proves that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> met with a resistance too formidable to allow them to pursue the invasion even to <placeName key="tgn,7014504" n="1.000 68" reg="shreveport, caddo, louisiana">Shreveport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>We have the best reason, therefore, to conclude that our brethren beyond the <rs>Mississippi</rs> have won a brilliant triumph for Southern arms, and have re-echoed the shout of victory which was raised in the savannahs of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> at the beginning of the year, and has been responded to from the <rs>Ohio</rs>, the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> coast, and which will soon be again re-echoed from the <rs type="place">Rappahannock valley</rs> with such thunders as will agitate the continent &mdash; the <rs>South</rs> with joy, the <rs>North</rs> with despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The South now indeed is both cheerful and confident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>And though we look with such assurance of victory on the blood-stained soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> as permits us not to doubt, still we know that victory comes from Him who rules the destiny of nations, and who has for some wise purpose already inured us to calamity in this struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Should we once more be disappointed the <rs>Southern</rs> heart will not quail, but, renewing its vows to Heaven and to Country, will prepare again to meet the brutal and rapacious enemy in new fields, determined never to yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Nor will it ever yield, and this spirit it is which must finally give us independence and that greatest of earthly blessings &mdash; freedom from political association with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the most hateful people on <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> earth. </p> </div3>

<head>The <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> notes.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> It is a useless and unavailing effort, that of attempting to check a stampeded public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>It is plain that there is a panic touching the <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> notes, which are doomed to death, as it were, on the <date value="07-01">1st of July,</date> some <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> hence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>They already assume the ghostly reputation &mdash; they smell of the dark vault wherein they are to lie, in musty confinement, until submitted to the flames and their unburned ashes shall be scattered to the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>So people touch them reluctantly and suspiciously &mdash; nay, with something skin to superstition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Not even the rigid, austere face of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>, which adorns them, can redeem them to something like existent and frigid reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The common idea is that the notes are mere apparitions, and that their spirit has fled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> These <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> notes are the main circulating medium of the country, and, being thus regarded, the greatest difficulty is experienced in business generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The new currency being a <hi rend="italics">better currency</hi> now, is hoarded, or, in other and more common phrase, driven from circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Traders and buyers have been subjected to increasing embarrassment as the doomed fives have fallen in value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Now they have come down to <num value="0.25">25 per cent.</num> below the new currency, and, were there enough of the new afloat to answer the purposes of trade, would be banished from circulation before their day of doom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>But apart from the habit of hoarding the new, the <rs>Government</rs> is issuing it with a slowness that is at least to be temporarily retarded by the removal of the note signing department to <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>So we are yet to be smartly incommoded by the embarrassments occasioned by these notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> What is the remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Why, we suppose nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It is better to endure the evil for the advantage of its extirpation after a time with the ultimate disappearance of the notes, than by some measure to give them a respite, and bring upon us at some day more remote similar troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Some people say Congress ought to give them this respite this prolonged circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Congress will hardly do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>It would not be wise to stop backwards in the measure for retiring the currency, and improving the <rs>Government</rs> credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The law has its thumb on the fives, and we have no idea that it will let them go. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> Nevertheless, let not the people be too much stampeded by the depreciation of the fives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They are fundable in <num value="0.04">4 per cent</num> bonds until the <date value="07-01">1st July</date> at par and after that at <num value="33">thirty-three</num> and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> per cent discount; and the <num value="0.04">4 per cent.</num> bonds are receivable in taxes to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>There is really no good reason for their rapid depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They are like the new, but the promises to pay of the <rs>Government</rs>, and with as fair's chance of ultimate redemption as any of its issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Indeed their employment for a time is unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>There will be no trade without them, and the disposition should be to make the most of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We do not mean &#x0022;make the most <hi rend="italics">out of them,</hi>&#x0022; as too many people will be inclined to act upon this remark. </p> </div3>
