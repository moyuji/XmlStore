<head>Important from the seat of war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The information received from the seat of war since our last issue is so meagre in its details that it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at any direct conclusion as to the operations of the contending forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>From the remarkable reticence that is observed, and the astonishing success which attends the efforts of the <rs>Government</rs> to withhold all intelligence of the movements of our forces, it is inferred that some magnificent plans for the annihilation of the <rs>Federal</rs> army are on the eve of execution, and that a few days will demonstrate the wisdom with which these plans have been devised, and the spirit and vigor with which they have been carried out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It is asserted, on what ought to be regarded as reliable authority, that our forces, in large numbers, have gained the rear of the enemy, and that on <name>Saturday</name>, and perhaps yesterday, a bloody struggle was in progress on <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, in the immediate vicinity of the battle-field of the <date value="1861-07-21">21st July, 1861.</date> Coupled with this statement is another, to the effect that other divisions of our army were pressing the enemy from this side, and forcing him on in the direction of our forces that have already been thrown between him and <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These statements we believe to be entitled to fuller consideration than should be given to mere street rumors, but we do not claim for them the sanction of unquestionable authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We give them because we think them not at all improbable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> There are also reports of a heavy battle on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, near <orgName n="Bristow Station" type="station">Bristow's Station</orgName>, <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance>, <offset>south</offset> of  <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName></placeName>, between the <orgName>division of <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName></orgName> and the forces of the enemy, in which it is said that our forces were twice driven from their position, with severe loss, but receiving reinforcements, finally drove the enemy back, capturing several batteries and some <measure n="5000" type="prisoners">five thousand prisoners</measure>. Reports conflict as to the precise locality of this engagement, <num value="1">one</num> representing it at <orgName n="Bristow Station" type="station">Bristow's Station</orgName>, and the other near the <rs type="place">Plains</rs>, on the <placeName reg="Manassas Gap">Manassas Gap</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>If such a fight really took place, we think it more than likely the latter location is correct. --It is also stated by some that the <orgName>divisions of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName></orgName>, <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, were all in the battle, and others that it was fought by <orgName n="division"><persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> alone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Another report, which was brought to the city by passengers on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and again yesterday, represents that <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> has taken <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> and holds possession of the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> Bridge at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>No particulars of the capture of this place are furnished, but those familiar with <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s dashing exploits are generally ready to believe any report with reference to his daring feats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The latest information from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> placed the <rs>Federal</rs> forces there at <num value="4">four</num> regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This force may have been withdrawn, or it may have been increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The Federals have for some time boasted that the town was strongly fortified and prepared to resist the attack of a vastly superior force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>How much truth there was in these boosts will be shown by a confirmation or contradiction of the report of its capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If it has fallen into our hands, it has been captured by a cavalry force, unsupported by infantry or artillery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> A member of Congress, who came down on the <rs>Central</rs> train yesterday afternoon says that the <orgName n="Baltimore Sun" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi></orgName>, of <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, had been received in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, in which it was stated that our forces had captured at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <num value="5">five</num> trains of cars loaded with provisions, and that later on the same day <num value="5">five</num> other trains, on board of which were some <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>This affair was commented upon by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press as very discreditable to their commander, and some harsh reflections as to his fitness for his position indulged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Our own account of this affair reports that a portion of our cavalry had advanced on the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria railroad</orgName> to <placeName reg="Bull Run bridge">Bull Run bridge</placeName>, about <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> beyond <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName></placeName>, and having burned the bridge continued their advance to <placeName reg="Dye's Station">Dye's Station</placeName>, where they concealed themselves, and arrested the approach of a number of trains of which they had previously received information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>After the trains passed the concealed position of the cavalry the track was torn up behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>When they reached the bridge, the officers on board finding that something was wrong, determined to return to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, but before backing far they found the track torn up, and their retreat effectually intercepted.--The cavalry then approached in superior numbers, and the enemy surrendered without firing a gun. The number of prisoners reported captured agrees with the statement of the <hi rend="italics">Sun,</hi> being estimated at <num value="2000">2,000</num>, together with all the officers, regimental and company, and a quantity of arms and ammunition which were being conveyed to <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>After this brilliant affair the cavalry returned to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, without sustaining the loss of a single man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Some <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> to <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners were yesterday between <placeName reg="Rapidan Station">Rapidan Station</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, and may be expected in this city to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is supposed that these are the prisoners captured at <placeName reg="Dye's Station">Dye's Station</placeName> by our cavalry. </p> </div3>

<head>Armed intervention.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> Anything less than armed intervention by several of the leading powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will do our cause more harm than good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The recognition of our independence, the raising of the blockade, and alliance, offensive and defensive, with <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, would but exasperate and unite the <rs>North</rs>, and thus strengthen her and induce us to relax our exertions, and thereby weaken us. No <num value="1">one</num> power in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> can successfully invade the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>If her sea-coast be blockaded and her seaport cithers captured, she will have more soldiers for her armies and fewer idlers to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The necessaries of life and the munitions of war are or readily can be produced in the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>So far as these articles are concerned, the seaboard cities are non-producers and most expensive consumers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/><measure n="3.5centuries" type="date">Three centuries and a half</measure> ago, every nation of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> lived within itself, independent of foreign trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>No section of the globe produces with so little labor and in such abundance the necessaries of life as the <rs>Northwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Divested of her seaboard towns and of the artificial and acquired wants which those towns engender and maintain, and no country can sustain herself with so little labor as the <rs>North</rs>, and, therefore, no country can spare so large a proportion of her population for military purposes.--She raises an immense surplus of meat and bread and can dispense with tea, coffee and sugar, as did the nobility even of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> <measure n="3centuries" type="date">three centuries</measure> ago. For clothing, she can use wool and hemp and flax, as did our ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>In fine, she can be just as comfortable, and far more independent, without foreign trade than with it. Her intense hatred to the <rs>South</rs>, her pride, her exasperation, would induce her, in case of foreign intervention, to readily sacrifice all artificial and acquired wants, and live within herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Without a navy and without a mercantile marine, for <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers might divest her of them, several <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men would be disengaged from their accustomed pursuits, be without employment, and burning with indignation and thirst of revenge against the enemies who had thrown them helpless on the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>From choice as well as necessity they would join the invading armies of the <rs>North</rs> and constitute the most efficient soldiery in those armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Her foreign trade enfeebles the <rs>North</rs>, our want of such a trade and want of a navy, enables us to concentrate all our force and thus strengthens us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The currency question now disturbs the <rs>North</rs> because her foreign trade brings her paper currency in contact with metallic currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Blockade her ports, cut her off from all connection with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and her paper would, for all useful and necessary purposes, be as good as gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The whole of her industry and the whole of her power would be exerted for war purposes, if she were blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Now, <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of that industry, and <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of her effective force is occupied in producing needless luxuries for the rich, or in supplying the artificial wants of all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>A successful blockade would double the military power of the <rs>North</rs> in conducting a war against us. She might then as readily put <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of men in the field as she can now put <num value="1000000">one million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>No <num value="1">one</num> foreign enemy could capture her river marine, and with that she can reach the heart of our dominions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> It is chiefly because we have been blockaded that we have exhibited such wonderful power in this struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It has enable us to concentrate our forces and our energies, to dispense with foreign luxuries, and to produce more of the necessaries of life and the munitions of war; and it has moreover saved us from all difficulty and vexation on the currency subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Our cotton and tobacco, unsold, represent their value in <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, and serve as a basis for our present and future credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Had our ports been open, a large portion of our people would have been employed in sending these articles to market, selling them, and in selling the useless luxuries for which they had been exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Our foreign exports bring us in little that is useful, and scarce anything that is necessary, or if necessary, like salt and iron, nothing that we had not better produce at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Foreign intervention that shall merely raise the blockade from our cities, capture the <rs>Northern</rs> seaboard towns, and blockade her coast, would be ruinous to us; and if we were relieved from the blockade, we should expend <num value="9">nine</num> <num value=".1">tenths</num> of the proceeds of our cotton and tobacco in useless luxuries, destroy the basis of our credit, and divert a large portion, probably <num value="0.5">one-half</num> our population, from war, or from industrial pursuits necessary to the successful conduct of the war, and set them to trading and money making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Let us have no recognition of our independence, no raising of the blockade, no mediation, no intervention, unless it be efficient intervention &mdash; an intervention founded upon just, humane, and sensible reasons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> Cotton has become the chief article of clothing for the civilized, the barbarous, and half the savage world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The war now waged against the <rs>South</rs> is carried on for the purpose of enabling the <rs>North</rs> to monopolize a great part of the cotton trade and of the manufacture of cotton cloths, thus reaping an illicit profit from Southern labor, and enhancing the price of cotton clothing the world over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Already the poor in every region of the globe find the expenses of living increased by this rapacious war, by this war which purposes to monopolize the products of the <rs>South</rs>, in order to enrich the dishonest <rs>North</rs>, by filching iniquitous profits, not only from the <rs>South</rs>, but from all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Let the <rs>South</rs> be subjugated by the <rs>North</rs>, and she (the <rs>North</rs>) will so restrict the export of cotton and tobacco, or impose such heavy duties on foreign commodities exchanged for them as to give her a monopoly of the cotton manufacture, and to break down the manufacture in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and other <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>She will in the same way lessen greatly the immense revenue obtained by <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> from duties on tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The <rs>North</rs> is resolved that the whole world shall pay to her exorbitant profits from her proposed monopoly of Southern products, and, besides, determined to exclude all other nations from the <rs>Southern</rs> market, as a mart for the sale of their manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The South is so rich and so exclusively agricultural that no other country whatever would afford half so large a market for foreign manufactures as she, were she but free and independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>In such situation she would lighten the labor of every working man in the world, (outside Yankeedom,) by furnishing him cheap food and clothing, or by keeping down the price of food and clothing by her large supplies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> The world feels and sees that the <rs>North</rs> is, in the fullest and strictest sense of the term, &#x0022;the enemy of mankind;&#x0022; and the world should see that, if she subjugate the <rs>South</rs>, she will in part subjugate mankind, by levying a tax on their ordinary food and clothing, and by excluding them from the richest market for their products.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Pirates are termed &#x0022;the enemies of the human race.&#x0022; and treated as such by all civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The people of Christendom have long since combined to exterminate them, and have almost succeeded in doing so. Few pirates now disturb the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>All the pirates, from time immemorial, have not inflicted half the human suffering that the <rs>North</rs> has occasioned in the last <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. Why should the little rogues be hung and the great ones go unpunished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>is not this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> war quite as nefarious in its purposes, and <num value="10">ten</num> times more mischievous in its consequences, than any or all piratical raids?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>is it possible to conceive a better, a more humane, just, benevolent, and philanthropic cause than that of the <rs>South</rs>, or a more inhuman and diabolical <num value="1">one</num> than that of the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Were the world to rise up in arms to aid the <rs>South</rs> and to punish the <rs>North</rs>, would it not be right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Does not the occasion call for it, and are not all the <name>Governments</name> of Christendom grossly derelict in duty to their subjects in not at ones relieving them from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> dishonesty and rapacity, just as they have relieved them from other piratical expeditions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Does the history of nations percent <num value="1">one</num> single occasion on which making war was so justifiable, nay, so incumbent, as would be a war of the world now upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The laws of nations are worth nothing if offenders are to go unpunished, and therefore the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> should not only aid the <rs>South</rs>, but should inflict such punishment on the <rs>North</rs> for her roguish acts and purposes as would deter her and others from similar offences hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> If common sense, common morality, or <name>Christian</name> benevolence regulated the affairs of nations, mankind would rise up in arms against &#x0022;the enemies of mankind&#x0022; and assert and establish the independence of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> Foreign intervention, to be useful or efficient, should be of this character &mdash; a sort of uprising of the human race to assert, maintain, and vindicate the cause of world-wide equity, honesty, justice and humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> There will be no such intervention, no such uprising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Crooked policy, not justice, controls the affairs of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>We shall be left alone to achieve our independence, and after it is achieved, the peoples of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will greedily seek to participate in its advantages, by entering into favorable commercial treaties with us. We shall owe them neither a debt of gratitude nor a debt of money, and it will be our right and our duty so to conduct our foreign trade and relations as will most redound to the profit and advantage of our own citizens, regardless of the consequences to other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Our cotton, tobacco, and other agricultural products, are our own. We can burn them, or charge what prices we please, and none-will have a right to complain, for none have aided us in our hour of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Independence, actual, not nominal, we must have; and if, in order to secure it, we have to trammel or exclude foreign trade, we shall not hesitate to do so. Money making, selling in the dearest markets and buying in the cheapest, is not always the wisest, the safest, or the best policy of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Let the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> look to it, that they do not, by their ungenerous and selfish course, compel us to pursue an exclusive policy, in order to confirm independence, however great may be our pecuniary sacrifice, or their loss of a profitable market. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
