<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Since the adoption of our last Schedule, for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>At this juncture, large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was, in a few days thereafter, to be taxed <num value="33">thirty- three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedule of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing, in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Therefore we assess the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules impressed since the passage of the currency bill, of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure>.--This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing officers and agents should forthwith </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> call on all those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the fore going basis; but allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>- class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our <hi rend="italics">average</hi> appraisement of <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>, and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules and proportionately less for the inferior as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The county appraisement will be the guide in making these settlements, but within the limits of our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure> and our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>. This plan would perhaps be most satisfactory to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>For whatever price the county appraisers agreed upon should be deemed fair within the range of our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure> and our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>; payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issue of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should, in all such cases, themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.
