<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Permit a volunteer querist to ask, through your columns: Have our rulers and the public generally come to the conclusion that Soldiers' Aid Societies are, at beat, an exploded humbug, if not a positive nuisance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Do they with all the mothers and daughters of the land coolly to ignore the mighty struggle in which they, of all others, have most at stake?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>And do they really count their moral and material co-operation as worth nothing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Or do they not know that human sympathy must recoil when it can no longer minister; that energy, allowed no scope for action, must in time die out from sheer inertias?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Would they have us sink in hopeless apathy and imbecility, when all that is ennobling and endearing in life call upon us to awake to the sleepless energy of thought and deed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Or do they expect us to <q>&#x0022;make brick without mortar,&#x0022;</q> that they thus suffer our alien Shylocks and indigenous enemies to lay their fell gripe on every species of working material, and paralyze our efforts with impunity? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> For <num value="5">five</num> long months individuals and societies have silently borne all this, vainly watching and waiting for the welcome flat, that should say to the imprisoned essentials, <hi rend="italics">come forth;</hi> but we are not blind, nor deaf, nor dumb &mdash; our vitality is only dormant, not extinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><persName n="Wool,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Wool,nomatch:0"><surname>Wool</surname></persName>, we know, is months away &mdash; cards are not, and if these were <q>&#x0022;thick as leaves in Vallambrosa's shade,&#x0022;</q> where are the hands to convert raw cotton &mdash; if we had it &mdash; into ginghams, chambrays, and other fabrics for soldiers' summer shirts in time?--We <hi rend="italics">must have</hi> fine bale cotton for this; but does mortal man stultify himself to the extent of supposing that the majority of us could if we would, or would if we could, buy it at from <num value="2">two</num> to <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> per bale, because <hi rend="italics">the contractors</hi> will not let honest merchants get a pound?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Not we &mdash; see every thread of it contracted round the <hi rend="italics">contractives'</hi> necks <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>And what is the use of telling us--<q>&#x0022;Never mind,&#x0022;</q> the contractors are working it up themselves for the soldiers' benefit?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Soldiers' swindle more like, but who is fooled now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Don't we know better?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Don't we know it was a break-neck chase last year to rig out the volunteers in all sorts and odds and ends of calicoes, brown linen, and jeans?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>With the no stock on hand now, it will require every loom and spindle in the land, from the mammoth factory to the smallest cabin, to fit out in due time all the <num value="1000">thousands</num> now in, or soon to be in, the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But supposing they were abundantly supplied every man of them, are they the only things of human genus addicted to wearing clothes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>What are we to do for dresses, the hospitals and home folks for sheets?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Is the country so exceedingly rich in imported prints, domestics, and home-made, that it can afford to dispense with all but contractors' manufactures?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Must we, our children and servants, mope and pine in <q>&#x0022;nakedness and rage&#x0022;</q> before we are conquered, or are we to be coerced into complicity with those worst of traitors and Judas Iscariot, the smugglers and extortioners, who go into-convulsions at the mere mention of a recruiting office, and come out of them fast enough at sight of a dime to help on bravely to pass over the country, bound hand and foot, to the tender mercies of their accomplices?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Is it a light thing that their foul presence broods, like the nightmare, over every <orgName n="Labor Department" type="department">department of labor</orgName>; that is its fell choke damp, woman's patriotic effort and domestic thrift are already gasping for existence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The rats' and the moths devouring their filling for want of a little warp, and all because legislation is too lofty, too squeamish or too dignified, to waste a moment's thought on such trivial things as households and aid societies, or think the dead-lock in all feminine industry a matter of the slightest consequence &mdash; just now, especially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><q>&#x0022;Oh, if you will bother and hinder with your pitiful <hi rend="italics">aids,</hi> no Knit.&#x0022;</q> Certainly, wool without carding, where it grows, <persName><foreName>Hon</foreName></persName> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Micawber,Mister,Aggregate,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Micawber,Aggregate,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Aggregate</foreName> <surname>Micawber</surname></persName>;</hi> but do you happen to know that the wool-growing resources of this State, if not others, being slightly out off for the time, we shall have to put <num value="1">one</num> thread of <hi rend="smallcaps">cotton</hi> to <num value="2">two</num> of yarn to help out and make the socks last all the longer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>And, pray, what has become of that proposed chemical establishment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Dyes we can make, but copperas and other mordants we must have, and are willing to buy at reasonable war prices, but not to lay down their weight in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>And if you had not smoked out, and soaked out, in villainous <q>&#x0022;red-eye&#x0022;</q> all the common sense you were born with, or had half as much left as an experienced matron, you would come out of your sublime trance long enough to lay your official digits on Contract-Dyes of bale cotton at least, and force them to disgorge, on fair terms, to aid societies and others, who want it to use, not to sell; and instruct your <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-in-Chief">Quartermaster-in-Chief</rs> to order all old socks to be preserved and forwarded to order for repairs &mdash; it being just simply impossible to replace them all with new, and make the other necessary clothing, too, out of the crop of wool now prospective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> If some other powers that be &mdash; and the press is <num value="1">one</num> of them &mdash; would only galvanize you out of sublimity into utility long enough to accomplish this, it would atone for much waiting, for something better than panics, and wholesale drafts to <q>&#x0022;turn up;&#x0022;</q> and then, perhaps, you might be kind enough to explain why wives &mdash; with families of small children hanging to their skirts &mdash; are so much better able than widows to carry on a plantation without either husband or overseer?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> We are, to some extent, wrapped in the mantle of gloom and uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The serious reverses of fortune which we have recently sustained, has been the <name>Pandora</name> to the hopes of many of our people, and become a breaker of gigantic proportions in the great high way of their once firm and enthusiastic confidence in the ultimate triumphant and glorious success of our efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There are those among us, <q>&#x0022;living and having their existence in our midst,&#x0022;</q> whose timid, despondent and irresolutenesses have led them to believe our cause a hopeless <num value="1">one</num>; who can already paint in vivid and striking colors the mode of our complete subjugation, the deprivation of our freedom, the plunder of our property, and our doom to unconditional servitude and bondage.--They read already with fear and trembling the unsparing mandate of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Generalissimos,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, in his imperial authority measuring out death to the leaders of this <q>&#x0022;untimely rebellion,&#x0022;</q> and riveting the chains of vassalage upon the followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>With however much contempt we may regard all such respondents, and treat with derision their <q>&#x0022;infantile&#x0022;</q> philosophy, yet every atom has its weight.--The constant drop of water will wear away the stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We often, of late, hear the harrowing and unfounded expression fall from the lips of those of whom we have reason to expect better things, <q>&#x0022;I believe we will be whipped.&#x0022;</q> While such an expression may emanate from <num value="1">one</num> whose loyalty is unimpeachable, and whose confidence in our triumph is firm and unconquerable, on the other hand it may, and frequently does, come with <unclear>gen </unclear> sincerity of the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>These despondent must communicate their fears and anxieties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Though timid and backward at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the frequent escape of thoughtless expressions, in the character of a jest, from individuals of known standing and firmness, will impart tone and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> --A friend informs us that a shad was sold in the <rs>First Market</rs> yesterday morning for <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure>. Of course it was a large, fat specimen of the scaly genus, and if an epicure wanted it for his table, he could without reluctance pay the price in shinplasters, which perhaps he did and perhaps not; if he did, he made a good bargain, and would have done so if he had paid twice the sum. A turkey sold for <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> a day or <num value="2">two</num> since; a giant of its species, like the shad; but considering the fact that small ones sell for a sum not much less, it may be argued that the gentleman and his friends who gobbled up the big gobbler, were not excessively victimized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>When we see a big <placeName reg="Shanghai, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119940">Shanghai</placeName> fowl we say, that creature can make a thundering noise of a morning, but he ain't worth much for the table; but when we see a big turkey, visions of white and tender slices, smothered in rich gravies, or fat and juicy oysters, incontinently rise up, and if we had <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> we would as soon pay it for such a monarch of the poultry yard as <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure> for <num value="1">one</num> of the smaller subjects; but the question arises, ain't the market people rather tucking it on to the citizens in the matter of fish, flesh and fowl?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We think so. Butter is only <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>That's quite reasonable, considering that the spring grasses are appearing and cows have no longer to beg for a mouthful of fodder in the farm-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>It entirely lacks salt, else it would unquestionably cost the consumer <num value="0.5">fifty per cent</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>To change the scriptural quotation slightly, <q>&#x0022;Butter hath lost its saltness.&#x0022;</q> It is useless to prolong the catalogue of market supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Everything sells in proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We frequently hear sojourners in the city speak of extortions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>They are, perhaps, right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>But the chief grievance falls upon the poor men who reside in the city, who have to pay double for the necessaries of life, and in few instances get any increase of remuneration for their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Keepers of hotels and boarding-houses pay enormously for the provend with which they supply their tables, but have increased their own charges accordingly; and this is what our visitors from other States complain of, perhaps without reason, under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We see but <num value="1">one</num> prospect, however, for the relief of our citizens in moderate circumstances; and that is, the reduction that may follow the adjournment of Congress and the <name>Legislature</name>, and the general stampede of hangers on about the seat of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>We do not conceive that there is any danger of starvation, unless, indeed, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> should overrun us; and from such a consummation may the stout arms of our soldiers (with a firm reliance upon the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles) deliver us. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/> The news from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> is not near so encouraging as that published in our yesterday's issue, and in some degree loss hopeful for our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>We see nothing in the news received, however, to discourage us, or to cause a feeling of gloom to ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>That our army has been repulse!, from the information before us, we are disposed to believe, but the confidence we feel in <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00243" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and his gallant troops, leaves abundant room to hope that his withdrawal from the field of conflict on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, was as successful as his evacuation of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/> Our news is predicated upon a telegram received at the <rs>Governor</rs>'s office yesterday, from <persName n="Harman,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="mostcommon:Harman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Harman</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The dispatch state, that <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> engaged the enemy within a few miles of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, at <time value="4:30">half-past 4</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, and that the fighting continued till nightfall, when our troops fell back to Cedar <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, about <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Our less is thought to be about <num value="200">two hundred</num>, a heavy proportion of which is in company officers &mdash; Among the killed or missing, the names of <persName n="Antrim,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="mostcommon:Antrim,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Antrim</surname></persName>, <persName n="Dale,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="mostcommon:Dale,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Dale</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00248" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Williams,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="nearbymention:Williams,Thomas,W.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> are given. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/> It is difficult to understand the circumstances connected with this engagement, particularly as previous information seemed to leave little doubt of the evacuation of the town of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>This was doubtless the impression of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, or he would hardly have marched his men <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> to engage a largely superior force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>The withdrawal of their force was no doubt a way to entrap him, and has too nearly succeeded, not to admit the question of a want of caution somewhere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> The telegram also states that the enemy were in pursuit of our forces; and if so, it is not at all improbable that a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> engagement has taken place ere this. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/> <num value="1">One</num> ordinary iron pot, for boiling; <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> tubs, palls, or barrels, case off; <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> small troughs; some coarse bags, or a wheelbarrow, to bring the earth from the cave; and <num value="4">four</num> strong barrels, with <num value="1">one</num> head in each &mdash; empty vinegar, whiskey, or pork barrels, are very good &mdash; are about all the articles required for a small saltpetre manufactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>To these, however, must be added some ash barrels to make potash lye, at this better that this should be made at the same time and place, the ashes from the fire under the pet for boiling assisting in the production. </p> 
<div4 type="entry"> 
<head>How to proceed.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> bare a hole about the size of the finger through the head or end of each barrel, near <num value="1">one</num> side, and fit a wooden plug to each hole &mdash; then set the barrels on some pieces of timber, near each other, the hands down, and the hole of each projecting over the timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Put some twigs into the bottom of each barrel, and on these place straw or hay about half a foot thick when pressed down; then, having brought some of the earth from the cave, and broken up all the lumps, file each barrel full without pressing it down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Put the plugs into the holes tightly, and fill up each barrel with as much water (hot water is best in winter) as it will hold; allow the whole to remain until next day, then pull out the plugs, having placed a tub or pail under each, and pour all the water from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> barrel into the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> barrel, and all the water or liquor which drains from this barrel must be poured on top of the earth of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> barrel, and, finally, the liquor which drains from this last barrel must be poured into a tub or other vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Now, having previously made some strong lye from wood ashes, pour a small stream of it into the tub and stir it well; immediately the clear liquor will become muddy, and as long as the lye continues to curdle or cloud the liquor it must be poured in. Of course you will have to wait now and then for the liquor to settle to see if it requires more lye. No more must be used than is necessary, for it not only wastes the lye, but is an impurity which the refinery must afterwards get rid of. We will suppose that the proper quantity of lye has been used, and the liquor allowed to settle or drain through cloth until it becomes clear; it is then poured into the pot and boiled away until a drop taken up by the end of a stick becomes hard or solid, when let fall upon cold metal, or upon a plate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/> The liquor is now to be dipped out of the pot and poured into a cloth placed over a tub or barrel, and allowed to strain through into the tub below and become cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>As soon as the liquor begins to cool, crystals of saltpetre will commerce forming, and when cold the liquor left &mdash; called mother liquor &mdash; must be poured off from the saltpetre back into the pot with the fresh liquor for boiling, as it still has considerable saltpetre in it.--There will be found at the bottom of the pot after the liquor is dipped out, when the boiling is completed, some earthy salts, which, after draining, can be thrown away as impurities; if, however, some long needle-shaped crystals should be seen in it when cold, it contains saltpetre, and about a quart of hot water should be added, and then poured off after a time, when it will have dissolved all the saltpetre left among the earthy salts; this wash water can be put back into the pot after the impurities shall have been cleaned out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/> The saltpetre formed by the foregoing process, must be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> allowed to drain well, and then placed on cloths scratched before the fire or out in the sun to dry; when the drying is completed, it is to be put into boxes or barrels, and is ready for shipment to the nearest ordnance officer, who will pay for the same on receiving the bills of its shipment on the railroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/> Further, refinement is not required from the caves; that is done by Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>For all saltpetre made and delivered before <date value="1863-01-01">January 1st, 1863,</date> <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> per pound will be paid. </p> </div4> </div3>
