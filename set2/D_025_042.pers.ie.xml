<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> A report from a seemingly well authenticated source, prevailed yesterday, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Few gave it any credence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Later and official information states that they have all withdrawn to the other side of the river, leaving <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and his cavalry in undisputed possession and &#x0022;master of the situation,&#x0022; on the hither side. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>A correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Express" type="newspaper">N. Y. <hi rend="italics">Express</hi></orgName>, writing from New Orleans furnishes the following: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> The report in question gives a somewhat different version of the conduct of the negroes in the assault made on the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num> to that given by eye-witnesses of their heroism, determination and daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Of their possession of these qualities there appears to have been some doubt, and, to force them to maintain their position in front and prevent a sudden &#x0022;change of base, &#x0022; a Connecticut regiment was placed in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>From this it would seem that &#x0022;they made, during the day, <num value="3">three</num> charges upon the batteries of the enemy,&#x0022; more as a matter of necessity than of choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>They were sent forward as sappers and miners, without arms, but with the implements, and means of preparing for the advance of the white troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Before them was an unseen enemy; behind them glistening bayonets in the hands of their professed friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>That they became desperate under such circumstances is by no means surprising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>They rushed forward upon sudden destruction, as a horse is said to dash into the devouring flames. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> As to the batteries upon which the negroes charged, a word of explanation is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The enemy had placed <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>, perhaps more, guns as a decoy, in a position that was exposed not only to a front, but an enfilading fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>This decoy battery was the <num value="1">one</num> upon which the negro regiments made their desperate charges, to be repulsed with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>What was left of them were afterwards sent to bring off the wounded, when they were again exposed to a terrible fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The result was, as reported by eye-witnesses, that only <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="700">seven hundred</num> out of nearly <num value="2">two</num> full regiments of negroes escaped slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>But few of their wounded were rescued, and that few saved themselves, not being disabled in their lower limbs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the members of the <rs>Connecticut</rs> regiment stationed to protect the negroes in the rear, says he fired a number of times during the day, and on neither occasion did he aim at the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The fire in the rear may have had the effect of goading on the &#x0022;sable soldiers&#x0022; to such feats of desperate heroism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> Previous to the assault upon his works <persName n="Gardner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:Gardner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName> sent, under a flag of truce, to inquire whether the negroes were to be pitted against his forces?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The reply of <persName n="Banks,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> was that the negroes were <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> soldiers, and must be treated and respected accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>On the receipt of this answer, those who witnessed the assault report that it appeared as though every available gun on the works or within them was brought to bear upon the <num value="2">two</num> negro regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>This may have been what was expected of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>If so, <persName n="Banks,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> was justified in saying of the negroes, &#x0022;they answered every expectation.&#x0022; If there is any glory in being thus substituted for breastworks, and being sacrificed for the protection of others, the negroes have covered themselves all over with that dear-bought commodity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Since then this terrible slaughter of the negroes who were rushed forward at the point of the bayonet, unarmed, upon certain destruction, is used to excite the negroes to rush to arms and avenge the death of their comrades. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> The accounts of desperate hand-to-hand struggles between the furious rebels and savage negroes, in which the latter freely used, having no other weapons, their feet, hands, head, and teeth, are purely imaginary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>No such contests ever took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Why would the <rs>Confederates</rs> come from their breastworks, when they were mowing them down by the <num value="100">hundred</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Men of common sense would not be thus prodigal of their lives, and the correspondents who write such stuff must entertain a very mean opinion of the intelligence of their Northern readers.--<persName n="White,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><surname>White</surname></persName> men of the <rs>South</rs> would not even thus acknowledge the equality of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>They only kill them as a matter of necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> assault the negroes are reported to have suffered a loss of <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="800">eight hundred</num>; but as no account appears to have been kept of them, the public will never know how many of them are thus emancipated for all time to come upon the battlefield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The destruction of slavery appears to be the prime object of the war, and it would seem that the authorities have become tired <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> of the slow and somewhat uncertain process of emancipation, and have determined to adopt the more summary mode of putting the males &mdash; all that are able-bodied &mdash; in the front rank, and thus get them killed off, while the women and children were huddled together in unhealthy localities, and left to die of disease and want.
