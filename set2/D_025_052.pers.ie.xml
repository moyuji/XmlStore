<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They labor on the gorge of the work every night, and we can see that the results of their operations are very important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>They seem to have built up an immensely thick barricade of sand bags, and perhaps cotton bales between the sand bags and the wall, covering the wall of the gorge and protecting the magazines, which are located in that face of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>From appearances the outer slope of the barricade is nearly perpendicular, and therefore liable, if badly torn at the base, to give way and tumble down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Still, as long as it stands, it is a capital protection to the brick wall, and will prolong the defence of the work somewhat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>But with a certain class of projectiles that we have it is not doubted we shall be able to get it out of the way. The barricade on the left flank of the gorge is nearly up to the parapet, and is about finished; that on the right is about up to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> tier of casemates, and progressing rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>A large black steamer, of the high-pressure style, was seen coming down the harbor yesterday afternoon towing <num value="3">three</num> large barges deeply laden, evidently containing bags of sand for <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The entrance to the sally port on the gorge face has been covered by a traverse of sand bags, and the sally port itself protected by a large traverse of the same material.
