<head>The &#x0022;Times&#x0022; and our Commissioners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Our <name>English</name> files have brought us, in its length and breadth, the philippic of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> upon <persName n="Mason,Commissioner,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commissioner">Commissioners</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Commissioner,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commissioner"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The reviling of the leading <name>British</name> journal are even more gross and vulgar than the condensed dispatch had represented them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It is wanton, gratuitous, brutal, and blackguard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The writer must have bought a bad fish at Billingsgate the day it was written; and had a wrangle with <num value="1">one</num> of its redoubtable dames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The tirade betrays an authorship fresh from such a contest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> With a pitiful want of taste, justice, and <unclear></unclear> the great journal charges these innocent gentlemen with the cost of the recent large shipment of <name>English</name> troops, arms, and military supplies to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This cost is supposed to be about <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of pounds sterling, or <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num> of dollars, and poor <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> are charged with the sum. Invited by the advertisements of the <rs>British</rs> packet at <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName>, these gentlemen went aboard of her, paid their passage money to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and betook themselves quietly to their state rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>After a few days of quiet sailing the vessel was suddenly brought to by cannon shots fired across her bow she was boarded, and the <rs>Commissioners</rs>, with their <rs type="role2">Secretaries</rs>, after protest and remonstrances, forced off the steamers as prisoners of war, or apprehended rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Upon this state of facts, with a logic worthy of the intellectual <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> and of the leading exponent of <name>British</name> opinion, that journal charges this affair, not to <persName n="Wilkes,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, nor to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, but to the innocent, passive, and helpless victims of the outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The great complaint of the <rs>British Cabinet</rs> was that the <rs>British</rs> flag had been insulted, and <name>British</name> honor outraged, by the proceedings of <persName n="Wilkes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>; and with a good deal more reason and logic could the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> call upon the <rs>British</rs> public at home to fender no ovation to the flag which had been the cause of the trouble, and to regard the <rs>British</rs> honor that had been outraged as of no more worth than <q>&#x0022;<num value="2">two</num> negroes.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;This flag and this honor has cost us,&#x0022;</q> it might say, <q>&#x0022;<num value="3000000">three millions</num> of pounds sterling; and we owe it to the <name>Exchequer</name> to taboo and pay no mark of consideration to the <num value="2">two</num> baubles that have put us to so much cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Let them go their way in the <name>Kingdom</name>; we have laid out too much money and suffered too big a scare on their account to bestow on them any further attention.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Take it all in all, this puerile and impotent outburst of ill-nature from the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable incidents of the war. Our Southern people have not demeaned themselves unworthily in seeking the recognition or sympathy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our tone towards that people and Government has rather breathed defiance than entreaty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We considered ourselves masters of the situation being fully as able to dispense with <name>British</name> gold and fabrics as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was able to dispense with our cotton and our markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We had never approached that country as petitioners for favor, but only as equals, having benefits to confer fully equivalent to the benefits we might receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We recognized the embarrassments which her large vested interests at the <rs>North</rs> imposed upon <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and we were not impatient of that recognition and renewed intercourse which we knew to be inevitable, but which we also felt must be delayed for a time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> It is not to be denied that the warm sympathy which our cause had elicited from the <sic>Engish</sic> masses, had kindled a like feeling of cordiality towards the old country in our own breasts; and we had begun to dismiss that antipathy which hostilities and rivalries of <measure n="90years" type="date">ninety years</measure> duration had engendered and rooted in the <rs>Southern</rs> breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We had begun to recur to the annals of the olden time, anterior to the <name>Revolution</name>, when it was the pride of our ancestry to proclaim and inculcate a devoted loyalty to the <rs>British</rs> crown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We reflected that the tides of immigration that had set in upon <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> shores for so many years had spread themselves over the <rs>North</rs>, and had very little overflowed into our Southern boundaries; that our blood was, in consequence, still purely <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, and that ties of consanguinity, if they had any force, bound us more closely to the <rs>English</rs> than to the hybrid and motley races that inhabit the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>These remote recollections, these obvious reflections, and the feelings naturally springing from them, were fast producing a strong partiality for the mother land in the hearts of our race; and we were looking with an interest, somewhat dramatic, to the reception which our Commissioners would receive &mdash; not from the <rs>British Government</rs>, which we know would be formal and probably not even public &mdash; but from the people of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The vulgar vituperation of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> has not at all changed our expectations in this behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We are at a loss to know what influences could have led that journal into so rude and brutal a proceeding; but the very fact that it finds it necessary to inveigh so bitterly against a probable ovation to our Commissioners; proves that the temper of the public was setting strongly in that direction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The specious logic employed by the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> in its protest against a measure evidently finding much favor with the <rs>British</rs> people, we have already remarked upon; but it was really unworthy even of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> to resort to falsehood in the attempt to make good its assault upon our Commissioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>That these gentlemen are <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> statesmen, and, as such, have at times employed a free tone of speech against our late national rival, is not denied; but that they owe the prominence they have attained in our country, as the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> alleges, to antipathies constantly expressed against <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, is a positive slander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Bad logic may be excused in the <hi rend="italics">Times;</hi> black guardism may be deplored; but willful falsehood is to be denounced in the foul mouth of the slanderer who employs it. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is presumptuous in a civilian to hazard an opinion upon military matters; but, to our uninitiated minds, it seems clear that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has never, had the immense numbers at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> which his organs pretend, or he would long since have made an advance movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Can it be conceived that with an army of <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men he would have waited more than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> after the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> before renewing the attack upon the <rs>Confederates</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Can it be supposed that when <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> had passed, and the roads and weather held out every inducement to an advance, and his army had arrived at as high a State of discipline as it <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> is <unclear></unclear> he would still <unclear></unclear> with <unclear></unclear> of <num value="2">two</num> <unclear></unclear> <num value="1000">thousand</num>, to <unclear></unclear> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> battle? Or can any <num value="1">one</num> suppose that his brief sickness, even if real, would have been permitted to prevent the <q>&#x0022;on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> when to wait for his recovery was to run the risk of losing, as they have lost, the fine weather and good roads, which could not be expected, at that late season of the year, to last much longer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The truth we believe to be that he has never had an available force of more than <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men, and that he was unwilling to trust that number against the triumphant heroes of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> The policy of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> &mdash; at least to us civilians it so seems &mdash; has been to hold the <rs>Confederates</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> by a hostile army in their front large enough to make an aggressive movement if our forces materially diminished, and then to endeavor to diminish those forces by seacoast expeditions that should threaten the homes of the brave men upon the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But in this he has been time after time disappointed; no troops were ordered away, and the seacoast was found able to take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>All these plans failing but <num value="1">one</num> is left, and that is to wait patiently till the time of our volunteers is up, and then when they have left and their places are supplied by new levies, to hurl his trained legions upon our militia, and realize the long cherished project of <q>&#x0022;On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> This, indeed, is said to have been explicitly stated by <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> in his conversation with <persName n="Colfax,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Colfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Colfax</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He appears to have felt no shame about it, considering it, as we suppose it may be considered by military men, a perfectly fair advantage to take of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Our own Government, of course, will do all it can to baffle this last resort of the enemy; but it is a matter which only the volunteers can decide. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> Information had reached me for some number of days that a heavy force was advancing towards my position, from the direction of <placeName reg="Clarksburg, Harrison, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117793">Clarksburg</placeName>, in the <rs>North</rs> western part of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>As these rumors became certainty, I made an effort to strengthen myself, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, by reinforcement, and secondly, by entrenchments, sufficient to with stand the very large force of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>My orders to <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Wise,C.,Jennings,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> I send you copies of, and also copies of his replies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>I failed in procuring reinforcements, but succeeded somewhat better in the construction of a temporary breastwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>At <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the evening of the <date value="09-10">10th of September,</date> the enemy, under the command of <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, (as we learned through prisoners,) of whose advance I was fully aware, at the head of <num value="10">ten</num> regiments, made his appearance before our entrenchments, when the battle instantly commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Our lines were necessarily very extended for the purpose of protecting our position, and when manned, left not <num value="1">one</num> man for reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The assault was made with spirit and determination, with small arms, grape, and round shot, from howitzers and rifled cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>There was scarcely an intermission in the conflict, until night put an end to the firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The enemy's force is estimated certainly between <num value="8">eight</num> and <num value="9000">nine thousand</num> men, whilst our force engaged was less than <num value="2000">two thousand</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> Upon the close of the contest for the night, I discovered that it was only a question of time when we should be compelled to yield to the superiority of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>I therefore determined at once to recross the <placeName reg="Mount Nebo, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119310">Gauley River</placeName>, and take position upon the left bank, which I accomplished without the loss of a gun, or any accident whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Our loss, strange to say, after a continued firing upon us by cannon and small arms for nearly <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, was only <num value="20">20</num> men wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The loss of the enemy we had no means of accurately estimating, but we are satisfied from report of prisoners and other sources of information, was very heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>We repulsed them in <num value="5">five</num> distinct and successive assaults, and at night-fall had crippled them to such an extent that they were in no condition whatever to molest us in our passage across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>I will only say that our men, without distinction, behaved with the greatest coolness, determination, and presence of mind, and while it is impossible to give praise to <num value="1">one</num> portion of the force engaged over another, it is but proper to say that the artillery behaved with the greatest bravery and efficiency; that under the command of <persName n="Guy,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Guy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Guy</surname></persName>, who had reached me only <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before, and were for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time under fire, behaved themselves in a manner worthy of all praise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> I am very confident that I could have beaten the enemy and have marched directly to the <rs type="place">Valley of Kanawha</rs>, if the reinforcements from <orgName n="column"><persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="mostcommon:Wise,C.,Jennings,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s column</orgName> had come up when ordered, and the regiments from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> could have reached me before the close of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> days conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>I cannot express the regret which I feel at the necessity over which I had no control, which required that I should recross the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I am confident that if I could have commanded the services of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men, instead of <num value="1800">eighteen hundred</num>, which I had, I could have opened the road directly into the <rs type="place">Valley of the Kanawha</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> It would seem now as if the object so nearly accomplished can only be obtained by an advance upon the enemy, by the left bank of the <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 2" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha river</placeName>, with a sufficient force at any time to give him battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>This force, if possible, ought to be collected from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Their close correspondence shows distinctly enough the urgent necessity of so shaping the command in the <rs type="place">Valley of the Kanawha</rs> as to insure, in the future, that unity of action upon which alone can rest any hope of success in military matters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> I have not thought proper to take any other notice of these transactions, than to bring them to the notice of the <rs>President</rs> and <rs>Secretary</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The reasons which have induced me to take this course, I am sure, will not be misunderstood by either. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> I apprehend the course the enemy proposes to pursue is to carry out the plans indicated by <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> to <persName n="Tyler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Tyler,R.,Emmett,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>, for the invasion of the interior of the <rs>State</rs> and the seizure of <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName>, set forth in an intercepted letter of the latter, a month ago. To prevent this I am in command of an actual force of <num value="4200">four thousand two hundred</num> men. This force will be required to oppose the advance of <persName n="Cox,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="mostcommon:Cox,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cox</surname></persName> and <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, with, as their forces, as they undoubtedly will, of at least <num value="1200">1,200</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It is not, perhaps, now too late to rectify an omission which was certainly not dictated by any want of courtesy to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, any more than to any other of the powerful empires to which we have not sent representatives. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In the development of internal resources, in commerce and manufactures, in her colonial wealth, in her army and navy, there has been a steady and vigorous increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>There seems good reason to believe that, under enlightened counsels, <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> will arrive again at her old pitch of greatness, and become <num value="1">one</num> of the most powerful empires of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.--She is <num value="1">one</num> of the few nations in which the spirit of chivalry has not died out with the increase of material gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The almost impassable condition of the roads having given us a brief respite from the assaults of our enemy, it is the religious duty of our Government and people to spend every precious moment of opportunity they now possess, in making the most thorough preparations for the next onset of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>As the great water high ways are not interrupted by the weather, we should strain every nerve to put our river and coast batteries in an impregnable state, having them always provided with bomb-proof coverings, so that they may not be mere slaughter pens for their gallant defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>These, and every preventive which military art suggests for the protection of assailable and vulnerable points, should receive instant and thorough attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>In addition to this, lines of fortifications, for the defence of our cities and towns, should at once be constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The people must realize the emergency that is upon them, and prepare to make every town on every route of the enemy's advance as near a Gibraltar as their means will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The natural position of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> renders it capable, by a proper system of fortifications, of being made absolutely impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>These defences ought not to be confined to the immediate neighborhood of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>A chain of tremendous fortifications might be built around and at some distance from it which would defy forever any force that the enemy has at his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Every city and town in the <rs>State</rs>, and in the whole <rs>South</rs>, should be fortified in the same manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We have plenty of materials, abundance of labor, and the whole white as well as black population might be employed in this work of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>These fortifications could be defended by militia as effectually as by regulars, and the entire <rs>South</rs> converted into an entrenched camp which would render any attempt at our subjugation sheer insanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>If we are alive to the importance of the crisis, we shall set about this work at once, and not spend in criminal lethargy and inaction the opportunity for preparation which the state of the place now presents, but which will soon pass away. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>While taking a hasty plate of soup, and at the same time commenting on <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName>'s peculiarity or habit of simultaneously carrying several handkerchiefs in his pockets, it became necessary or expedient for the <rs>Judge</rs> to wipe his month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Accordingly, plunging his right hand in his left coat pocket, <hi rend="italics">a la <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00358" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>,</hi> (suiting the action to the word,) for his handkerchief, he pulled out a long linsey-woolsey blue stockings, with which, unconscious of the strange substitution, he incontinently commenced the wiping process, the foot of the article hanging down on the left side of his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>A general machinations or rather explosion of laughter, was the natural result, and the lady sitting on the <rs>Judge</rs>'s left, who had caught the merry infection, said almost inarticulately,--<q>&#x0022;Why, <rs type="role2">Judge</rs>, what, in the name of wonder, are you wiping your face with?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/> This called the <rs>Judge</rs>'s attention to the very odd <hi rend="italics">wipe</hi> he was busily plying about his month and face, and thereupon, lifting it up and taking sight at it, with his cross eyes, in his own peculiar way, and realizing the ludicrous fact, he exclaimed, after a hem or <num value="2">two</num>, with his usual hesitancy of utterance: <q>&#x0022;Ah ! eh ! why 'tis <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s blue stocking !&#x0022;</q> (meaning <persName n="Hunter,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00360" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the <rs>Judge</rs>'s room-mate in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.) This unexpected explanation of the funny incident only the more set <q>&#x0022;laughter shaking both his sides,&#x0022;</q> and swelled the uproar, until the very roof rang with the merry peal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>After order and silence had been restored, the <rs>Judge</rs> humorously confessed the awkwardness of his predicament, and explained that, in a fit of absence, after performing his toilet, he had unconsciously, along with his handkerchief, thrust <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Hunter,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s stockings into his pocket; and added, <q>&#x0022;for Heaven's sake, don't tell that woman, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> C**y, of it.&#x0022;</q> </p>
