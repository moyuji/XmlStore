<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Yesterday afternoon intelligence reached the city that a heavy column of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had made their appearance in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Frederick's Hall">Frederick's Hall</placeName>, on the <orgName n="Virginia Central Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia Central Railroad</orgName>, <placeName><distance reg="50miles">fifty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The statement was somewhat startling because of the known fact that the greater portion of the <orgName n="Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">reserve artillery</orgName> of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> was quartered at that point, and without an adequate force for its protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Later in the afternoon the report reached the city that the whole of the artillery, amounting to some <num value="80">eighty</num> pieces, had been captured; but this in turn was contradicted by a statement that the enemy did not go to <placeName reg="Frederick's Hall">Frederick's Hall</placeName>, but struck the railroad some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> south of that point, where they tore up a portion of the railroad track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>After inflicting this damage on the road they left, taking a southerly direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We are Inclined to think, form all the information we can gather in relation to the affair, that this latter statement is in the main correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Such was the case in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, where no opposition was expected, and where the additional inducement was held out of converting the <rs>State</rs> into a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> State, prepared to vote for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> next fall.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> That the campaign will be fierce, bloody, and arduous, all indications seem to declare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>That we have any reasons to fear the issue, provided only we be true to ourselves, we do not see any reason to believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It is not for the fear of this that we would impress upon our people the danger of over-weaning confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It is because we believe that it can be lost only by indulgence in that confidence to the neglect of the necessary precautions These being taken, we may, we think, dismiss all fears of every kind whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Provided they be not neglected, we care not how buoyant may be the hopes, how confident the expectations of our troops, our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and our population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The spirit prevailing in our armies marks, we think, the proper limits within which our confidence should be confined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>They know that they have before them a task of great difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Yet they are not only willing but anxious to enter upon it. They are full of courage, but it is a calm, deliberate courage, which has weighed the danger and will not shrink from it. They are full of enthusiasm; but it is of that deep-seated enthusiasm which will neither be abashed by obstacles nor dissipated by the appearance of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>They are buoyant with hope; but it is hope fortified by knowledge, and sustained by the high and holy promptings of religion and patriotism They regard the results of the late engagements as auguries of the future, and taken in that light they will prove of immense service in stimulating their exertions and firing up their valor.
