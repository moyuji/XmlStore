<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The work was commenced on the <dateStruct value="-06-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> last as previously stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Such was the secrecy with which it was conducted that for a long time the project was unknown even to those at whose side it was going on. It is true that reports were in circulation of a mine; but nobody could speak certainly of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>So much doubt was there, indeed, that for a time it was disbelieved that any undertaking was on foot. </p> </q><bibl n="Herald"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> <num value="1">One</num> soldier in the breastworks, by whose side a ventilating shaft emerged, told his comrades, in the most surprised manner, that &#x0022;there was a lot of fellows under him a doing something; he knew there was, for he could hear 'em talk.&#x0022; To guard against indiscretion on the part of the pickets, to prevent any meeting of our soldiers with the rebels, whereat the secret of the mine might be boastingly or imprudently disclosed our pickets were ordered to fire continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Hence the never ending fusillade on the front of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 9">Ninth corps</orgName>, so incomprehensible to the other corps, and which was often referred to in newspaper paragraphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The enemy doubtless suspected at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that the undermining was going on; but when several weeks elapsed without any demonstration their suspicious began to vanish, especially as their engineers thought the plan unfeasible. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Progress of the work.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> The progress of the work was necessarily very slow, and it was not until the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="25">25th instant</day></dateStruct>--just <num value="1">one</num> month after inception &mdash; that it was completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>At the outset <num value="1">one</num> of the most important points was to ascertain the exact distance and bearing of the rebel fort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> The excavation was commenced in the side of the hill whereon our exterior line of works run. The funnel or, to use the technical term, &#x0022;gallery,&#x0022; is about <num value="4">four</num> and half feet high, nearly as many feet wide at the bottom, and <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> wide at the top. The usual army pick was not suited to the work, as its flukes were too broad to permit their swinging in the funnel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This difficulty was easily overcome by filing down the flukes to the size of the regular mining pick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Water was met with not far from the entrance, and for a time gave no little trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The floor, however, was planked, and the sides and ceiling shoved up. A quicksand was met with, and to obviate it the range of the tunnel was curved upwards, so that the latter half was several feet higher than at the entrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The oozing of the water formed mud in several places, so that the regiment came from their daily labor bespattered and stained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> At length the end was reached, and the triangulation was abundantly verified in the noise overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The nailing of timber and planks could be distinctly heard, and left no doubt that the men were directly beneath the rebel fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The enemy were evidently making a flooring for their artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>As near as could be ascertained, the distance from the tunnel to the fort was <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure>. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>The mine.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> After it was sufficiently evident that a point directly under the fort was reached, the construction of the mine was commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The angle of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> projects towards our lines, and under this angle the tunnel diverged into <num value="2">two</num> galleries, each running, as near as could be ascertained, under each side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It was the intention to make the mine consist of <num value="8">eight</num> magazines, placed at intervals along these branch galleries, so that the entire length of the fort might be blown up, in place of <num value="1">one</num> spot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> Preliminary experiments were made by <persName n="Pleasant,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Pleasant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Pleasant</surname></persName> with cartridges of powder, which he inserted in the earth and ignited by a fuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He ascertained that the work of making a breach would be more effectually secured by distributing the powder instead of putting it in bulk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In the latter case the explosion resulted in a deep and broad crater; in the former in a wide chasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Where the cartridges &mdash; his miniature magazines &mdash; were not disconnected by packing, the tendency of the explosion was to find vent at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Hence, he resorted to packing between the magazines, or, as it is technically known, &#x0022;tamping.&#x0022; </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Charging the mine.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> The mine was charged to day. The quantity of powder used was <num value="6">six</num> tons!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> At <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> to <num value="5">five</num> a cloud of dust was seen rising from the rebel entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>This was followed by a general upheaving of earth, which reached probably <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure>. The whole mass looked like a huge fountain of earth and dust, and formed a most imposing spectacle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Simultaneous with this explosion our batteries along the entire line opened a most murderous and destructive fire upon the rebel breastworks; and the infantry, with deafening cheers, rushed into the embankments of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>A constant cannonading, lasting now <num value="1">one</num> hour and <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, has been going on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Several of our own wounded are also coming in, and they report that the slaughter inflicted upon the enemy by the explosion and the accurate range of our shells from the guns and mortars is terrible in the extreme. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> So far the victory is ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The air is thick with flying missiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>We are punishing the enemy steadily and surely, and are occupying his fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The corps engaged are the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num>, <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num>, and <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> It is by far too early to estimate the number of our casualties or those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Those in the immediate front, where the mine was sprung, report that the excavation made by the expression resembles the mouth of a crater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The earth was loosened and thrown in the all for hundreds of yards around. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> --We were informed early in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> that the demand for army supplies was so argent that your Department felt constrained to disregard our schedule prices then in force, and offer market rates to the farmers for their wheat, if delivered in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>This policy was deemed indispensable to insure the <name>Early</name> receipt of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Concurring with the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War. Department</orgName> in the paramount importance of obtaining, at the earliest practicable period, an ample quantity of wheat for the support of the army, we apprehended, as so great a disparity existed between our former rates and the rates then offering in our leading cities, that unless we advanced prices our action might seriously embarrass the government in their efforts to obtain immediate supplies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> Under these circumstances, and owing to the very short, crop of wheat and unprecedented demand for breadstuffs, together with the depredation in the currency, as well as to the farther fact that the farmers were then securing the oat and hay crops, we proposed the advanced prices set forth in our <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> schedules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> But now, as the immediate wants of the army are being provided for, and vigorous efforts are initiated to reduce the currency and reinstate public credit, we are disposed to accept the recent manifestations of public opinion in regard to our prices as the strongest assurance that in future adequate supplies can be secured on very moderate terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> As the press, the public, and the formers in part, have all united in condemning our rates as too high, we therefore Defer to what seems to be the general desire and propose the following prices: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> In assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the government needed at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that <hi rend="italics">all horses</hi> at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value</hi> are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> The terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or price for a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> In illustration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however officiant, or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price, and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price; so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &#x0026;c. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> Since the adoption of our Schedules for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereinto to be taxed <num value="33">thirty-three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to render any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Therefore, we <unclear></unclear> the average value of artillery or wagon horses or mules, impressed since the passage of the currency bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly on each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forthwith nail on all of those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>But allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our average appraisement, <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">$400</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the interior, as they may full below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> The impressing officers in these instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should in all such cases themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But if, after this re-valuation and settlement, any person should not be satisfied, the party could then appeal to our Board and have the case reconsidered. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Hubard,,E.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="default:Hubard,E.,W.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName>  <surname>Hubard</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gibbonet,,Robt,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="default:Gibbonet,Robt,,,"><foreName>Robt</foreName> <surname>Gibbonet</surname></persName>, Wm.
