<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> As I felt this morning like ridding myself of the noise and bustle of the camp, I have passed out the guards and am now quietly seated in a shady grove enjoying the rare luxury of being close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>While I am here my mind naturally reverts to friends far away, and home with its <num value="1000">thousands</num> of lender associations, and since many inquiries concerning us have been recently made by those whom we have left behind and who feel a deep interest in our welfare, I propose through the medium of your columns to give such information as our authorities here will permit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> All things are working well, and if our friends will but wait patiently until the battles are fought, they will read with joy the history of our glorious achievements, and admire the prudence and consummate wisdom used in accomplishing such grand results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It seems it has been many days since we left our homes to be formed into a Regiment at the <rs type="place">Hermitage Fair Grounds</rs>, near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.--Strange to say, that in camp life, the days pass swiftly by, but the mouths <q>&#x0022;drug their slow length along&#x0022;</q> It seems here that <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> in a week, but <num value="4">4</num> times <measure n="7days" type="date">7 days</measure> are enough for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>. After we had hidden fare well to your city, and had turned our backs repentantly upon faces beaming with patriotic zeal, with mingled tears and smiles we were cheered with demonstrations of applause throughout the entire route to <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, as our long and heavy drown swept on by the stately mansions of the rich and the humble cottages of the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>At the dead hour of midnight, and even on towards the dawn of day, we passed little groups of ladies waving their while handkerchiefs and bidding us <name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The old men raised their hats above their beads and gave us an approving smile, as much as to say they washed they were young again; and the children caught up by the excitement, leaping with frantic joy, unfurled to the wind whatever they could lay their bands upon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Upon arriving at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> we fully expected to go right into a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We thought we were ordered from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> for that very purpose; out after making inquiries, we found we were not so close to the enemy as we thought we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The demand for water there was near being greater than the supply but we made out after a fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><persName n="Wells,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Wells,nomatch:0"><surname>Wells</surname></persName> have been tusk there, and I learn that every regiment has a plentiful supply of good water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> From <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> we moved to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, distant about <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>. The water there was excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There were many copious springs in and around the beautiful grove in which we were encamped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There was like-wise a uniformity in the fasts and quality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> There is nothing more refreshing to a weary soldier than a cup of cool water, and an abundance of this element is essential to his health and comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The soldiers I it that pleasant place with reluctance, feeling confident that in all probability they would not be as well situated hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The march from <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> to this point was an easy <num value="1">one</num> of only <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>. The gentle rain that had fallen the day previous had settled the dust, and was not sufficient to make the roads muddy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is said we are close enough here to hear the enemy's drum when the wind is right and everything is still On the <date value="07-04">4th of July</date> we distinctly heard the firing of cannon in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>From the number of reports during the day, they had a lively time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Our soldiers are well drilled, and led on by our worthy <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> and his subordinate officers, I venture the assertion they will make for themselves a name in the coming contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We have prayer meetings and exhortations every night in camp, connected our distinguished <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs>, <persName n="Dabney,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Dabney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Dabney</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We soldiers think ourselves peculiarly blessed in having such comfortable quarters and such good fare, and although we are, and have been, on an outpost station and necessarily exposed to danger, yet none of us object to it on that account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Furthermore, we have reason to thank our stars for having such a set of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They are, with very few exceptions, a set of high-toned, honorable gentlemen, from <rs type="role2">Corporals</rs> to <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> I am free to admit that I came into the regiment with a prejudices against <persName n="Early,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, owing to his Pentium nations while in the <rs>Convention</rs>, yet I am happy to say that all this prejudices has been dissipated, and I believe he is <num value="1">one</num> among the best officers of the <rs>Southern</rs> army, and that he possesses in an eminent degree that coolness and judgment which will lead to certain success.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>--In your notice of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="SCVolunteer">South Carolina Volunteers</orgName>, a day or <num value="2">two</num> ago, you were kind enough to speak in commendation of its course and conduct; and as the action of that regiment in going home at this time has been the subject of remarks, not always amiable, you may be pleased perhaps to allowing space in your columns for a very few words in relation to it. I do not ask it altogether from an apprehension that time regiment may suffer in the estimation of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Conscious of having well discharged the duties of their office, I am not a ware that the members of the regiment experience any solicitude upon the subject; but the fact of their returning unexplained may indicate an ebb in the tide of military spirit at the <rs>South</rs>, and as it does not in fact afford such indication as properly understood; as it does not exhibit the slightest abatement of that courage which inspired us to the contest, it is important, as important to all of us as to the members of that regiment themselves, that the matter should be understood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> That regiment was the creation of an exigency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>When, upon the occupation of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Forts Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Pinckney">Pinckney</placeName> were taken by our State, it was certain there would be an effort forsake them; and to meet that effort a call was made for volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>To that call this regiment responded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It was not formed of men who are usually in the ranks of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Of their character, an inference may be drawn from the fact that <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> were doctors, and more than <num value="30">thirty</num> were members of the bar. They left their business as it was &mdash; their families unprovided for &mdash; some could not even see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>In less than a week the regiment was ready for the field; it took position on the inland; it had few of the appliances for military life; it incurred the severities of a winter in that exposed position; it performed much of the labor which insured the reduction of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and when that fortress was reduced there was a common feeling that its </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> work was ended; that, though the term of service was for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, the term was virtually ended in the achievement of the object for which it was appointed; and concurring in that feeling the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">Convention of the State</orgName>, again in session, by an ordinance, provided that if it were the wish of the members, that regiment should be honorably discharged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> But at this time <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was about to be invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It was understood that she had few troops in the field, and that few in that or any other Southern State were ready for the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The members of this regiment had much experience; they were impatient for their Homes, but the emergency would soon be over; it would only be for them to hold the breach until others could relieve them, and so, assured of the importance of their coming, and of the perfect propriety of their return when the immediate occasion should be over, they came; they sought and secured the post of danger; they were placed in the van of every forward movement on this line; they submitted cheerfully to what might have seemed the perils and privations of that position; and now, since other troops have come, they have the natural wish to return, for a time, at least, to their homes and business, so neglected, and they assume that they may do so without exhibiting the slightest abatement of that spirit which inspired them to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Nor does it, in fact, exhibit such abatement in them; for, in addition to the fact that they have done all and more than all they undertook to do almost all of them propose to return, as a speedy arrangement of their business will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>After these shall have left, she will yet have <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> troops in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, with <num value="3">three</num> other regiments ready to come on when called for, and that force amounting to more than <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> of the white population is greater in proportion than any other State has furnished, or, upon any reasonable apportionment, can yet be called upon to furnish. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> It may have been unnecessary that I should have touched upon this matter &mdash; improper, perhaps, that I should have dwelt so long upon it; but we are engaged in a most momentous undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It is important that there should be the most perfect confidence between the people of the <rs>South</rs>, and, impressed with this conviction, I have hoped a solicitude for an object so desirable would justify the public notice of a matter so apparently unimportant as are the reasons for the departure of a regiment from service. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Sreatt,,L.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="default:Sreatt,L.,W.,,"><foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName>  <surname>Sreatt</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> It is due to you, as well as to myself, in the present juncture of our affairs, that the motives should be announced which have induced my temporary absence from our State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Believing that our true interests demanded open, immediate and vigorous war upon the anthesis and abettors, from <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> down, of the rebellion against our State sovereignty on the <date value="05-10">10th of May</date> last, and confident, from the <name>Judgment</name> of competent military men, that <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was then better prepared to resist, than the <rs>Lincoln</rs> insurgents were to carry out, their plans of annulling our State lights, I dissented, though in a friendly spirit, from the policy of the <rs>Governor</rs> in making concessions to them in his earnest desire to preserve peace within our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Aware that some arrangement with that view was about to be made, and entertaining the firm better, since fully justified by events, that, as a truce would be energetically used by our enemies in completing their arrangements to war on us, no time should be lost in making up for previous neglect in preparing ourselves for the inevitable conflict, I left our Capital on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="2">20th</day></dateStruct> of that month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Reaching <placeName key="tgn,7016172" n="1.000 4" reg="arkansas">Arkansas</placeName>, by rapid traveling, on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day thereafter, I was fortunate in meeting <persName n="McCulloch,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:McCulloch,Ben,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McCulloch</surname></persName> immediately on his arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In view of <persName n="Jackson,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s declarations in his proclamation of the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, it is due to him that I should mention the fact that I have at no time had, and have not now, any agency of any kind from him; it is due to myself to add that since that proclamation I have cordially exerted myself to procure him support in the stand he has taken against our foes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> Rest assured of the profound sympathy with which the people of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> regard our condition; though engaged in a war against a powerful, they would not hesitate still further to tax their energies and resources, at the proper time and on a proper occasion, in aid of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The a vowed and decided policy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is to add her to their number as soon as her sovereign people desire the connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>That desire being unquestionable by any <num value="1">one</num> acquainted with their real sentiments, her union with her Southern sisters is merely a question of time and the opportunity which the course of events will, sooner or later, certainly afford. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> You will not expect me to be more explicit; nor would the silence I have hitherto observed be now broken, had not several patriotic Missourians advised this address, with the hope that it might contribute towards confirming your determination to free your selves from the despotism now seemingly triumphant in our State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> I rejoice to learn from various sources that even amid the present gloom you remain confident of final success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>We are draining to the very dregs the bitter cup of Federal usurpation; but the medicine was needed to cure the diseases of our body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The military advantages lately obtained by our oppressors are not surprising, for your perilous uprising at the call of our Governor was made without that previous concert with your natural allies which was almost indispensable for success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But the fortune of war is prone to change; be ready to take advantage of it. Do nothing weak, nothing rash, Wherever a favorable opportunity occurs, rally to the standard of your Governor, if those co-operating with him; but partial uprisings, in defenceless positions, or without due concert of action, are worse than useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Watch the opportunity to strike with effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Mean while let each <num value="1">one</num> of you quietly prepare; nearly all of you are doubtless now aware that your ordinary rifles and shot guns with <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> balls are equal to the weapons of your foes, and in your practised hands will rarely fall of their marks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Be not impatient of delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Success in war depends greatly on a proper combination of preparation, precaution and during; on blows surely given at the right time and place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>You have this inestimable advantage; if the hopes given you, by me now or by others, of effective aid, should incite the enemy to increase his forces in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, he but weakens himself else where, and hastens in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> his own defeat, which is your victory; if he remains inactive, he but shortens the time of your captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Be of good cheer; be but true to yourselves, invoking the aid of the <name>Almighty</name> who has so visibly favored the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and sooner or later the day of your deliverance will surely come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> With the limited information obtainable here concerning recent even is in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, it is difficult to form a judgment about our immediate future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>But as our enemies claim that they are about to capture <persName n="Jackson,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, you will, I trust, not consider it ostentation in me to give you this public assurance that, to the best of my ability, endeavoring to mingle prudence with energy and firmness though with a painful consciousness of the difficulty and responsibility of the charge, I shall, in humble reliance on the guidance and support of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, unhesitatingly undertake any constitutional duty events may impose upon me. And should, unfortunately, any vacancy in the <orgName n="Executive Office" type="office">Executive office</orgName> occur, which under our Constitution authorizes a new election for Governor, I earnestly hope that no State officer or authority, exercising or claiming the power of Governor in my absence, will order an election until, by the expulsion of the enemy, the choice of the voters can be rendered perfectly free. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> The difficulty of speedy communication with <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> being great, I respectfully request the newspapers friendly to our cause in adjoining States to publish this address, and thus give it a surer opportunity of reaching our own journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> It is common to herald a <rs type="role2">President</rs>'s Message to the world as an important document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>And often it is so. But never was a message less important than the <num value="1">one</num> transmitted to Congress by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, although the occasion is the most extraordinary that ever occurred in our country for the writing of a message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The telegraph, or some strange fate that presided in the transmission and re-print of the document, has apparently coincided in this vies of its value, for never before have we had a more painful jumble from which to extract the pith and meaning, the statement and sequence of a State Paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>We mean no disrespect to the <rs>President</rs> in saying so. we mean simply that we knew beforehand the sentiment of the country in regard to the war, and neither <rs type="role2">President</rs> nor Congress will be expected, or indeed permitted, to do anything contrary to the public will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> We are disposed to postpone criticism upon a document that appears to be so barbarously trended in its transmission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>But we must say that altogether to much attention is bestowed on <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s act of Secession in the <name>Message</name>, and the mode in which it was accomplished by the <orgName n="Richmond Convention" type="convention">Richmond Convention</orgName>; and less is said than would have been acceptable, in regard to the movements of the people of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> and of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, for their relief from the tyranny of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> and the prospect of their success through the aid of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Something more than <num value="1">one</num> sentence on <q>&#x0022;the practice of privateering&#x0022;</q> by the seceded States, tue occasion perhaps demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The country would have liked to know what is the prospect of the ratification of the convention of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> governments which declares privateering to be piracy.
