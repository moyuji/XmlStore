<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> --Some weeks ago the <rs>Governor</rs> issued a proclamation calling out the whole militia force of certain counties of this State, and the call was rightly censured, because such a wholesale requirement would have stopped the wheels of industry wherever it was applied; but, soon afterwards, other proclamations were issued, <num value="1">one</num> calling for a <num value="0.1">ten per cent</num>, quota of all the white population, and the other making certain necessary exemptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It was soon found out that many of the counties thus called out had truly furnished their legal quota in volunteers, and some others not having done so, their militia is now rendezvoused or in service; but there is <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> class which has been returned by mistake as having furnished their quota, when there is yet a number due. When the calculation was made in this last class, the number of companies in some cases was multiplied by the maximum number of men required,--viz; <num value="100">one hundred</num>,--thereby making a greater number of volunteers than there actually were, because in many companies the maximum number had not been reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Other mistakes have also been made, and thus some counties have their militia now out in service, and in others the members of the militia have been returned to their homes when really their quota has not in this latter class been furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>There are many able bodied idle men yet in this city and county who would make good soldiers, and many men did enlist in various companies once being formed, but not having been mustered in, withdrew when the militiamen went back to their homes by an order founded on an error. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>In <num value="1">one</num> county the mistake was found out and the militia recalled; since which, more than the quota of volunteers has been furnished, and the balance returned home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The channel pointed out was <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, that country having been excepted in the general law against exporting cotton through any other than the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The paper in question, after indulging in certain generalities about the irreversible laws of trade, and the superiority of the laws of demand and supply to all blockader and prohibitory tariff, stated that during the <rs>Russian</rs> war <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> received through <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> every article of <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> production of which the stood in need, as freely as the had obtained them during peace, although, of course at the expense of some inconvenience and considerable additional cost.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> It is, we believe, a well-established fact, that in every campaign &mdash; even where the sanitary regulations approach nearest to perfection &mdash; more men are destroyed by disease than by the casualties of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>This is a truth which, we venture to suggest, should be ever foremost in the minds of rulers, and persons generally who have charge of such matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Above all things, cleanliness, comfort in camp, and whole-some food for the soldier, should be attended to. We know not that our armies want any of these things; but it is well to keep the subject before the ruling powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>We speak not now of our hospitals, or the means and appliances there collected for restoring the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> To begin with this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Troops are continually arriving and encamping here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It sometimes happens that they arrive in the midst of a Heavy rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>When this happens, it strikes us it would be the wisest plan to march them at once to some of our tobacco factories, or other unoccupied houses, where they can remain until their clothes become dry, and not take them off at once to their tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>This seems to us peculiarly advisable just at this time, when the measles are very prevalent, and when it might happen that a whole corps bore with them the seeds of the disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Persons laboring under measles are in general easily cured if they do not take cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>But the nature of the complaint is such as to render the patient peculiarly liable to cold upon very slight exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>When cold supervenes, great danger almost invariably follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>A man with the measles on him incurs a fearful risk from being drenched in the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>We make these suggestions in order that our authorities may take the hint, and turn their attention at once to this very important subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> Too much attention cannot be paid to the health of the soldier while in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>A sick man cannot do duty; and an army in which large numbers are prostrated by disease is nigh akin to no army at all. Hospitals of course ought to be as complete as circumstances will allow; but it is best to keep out of the hospital altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>In many cases this is impossible; but, in still more, the necessity may be obviated by timely precautions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Some of these are in the power of the men themselves &mdash; such as sobriety, temperance in eating and drinking, a strict attention to personal cleanliness, and care in always spreading a blanket or an over coat on the earth before lying down upon it.

He contended, and we think successfully, that the latter practice was better for the soldiers on the score of health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>A tent, he said, would always be more or less damp in damp weather, and the inmates, of course, would suffer in proportion, When troops bivouacked, on the contrary, they always built large fires, which counteracted the effects of a moist atmosphere, and slept around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Elsewhere, he says that the <rs>French</rs> troops who blockaded <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, a locality famous at the time for pestilential fevers throughout the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> months of Autumn, suffered very little from having adopted the simple precaution of keeping up large fires throughout the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>In trying to minister to the spiritual comfort of the many wounded that have been left behind, I have had frequent opportunities of hearing, from their own lips, an account of the gross deception which had been practiced upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>They were told that the great body of the people in the <rs>South</rs> were Union men, ready to rally around the <q>&#x0022;Stars and Stripes&#x0022;</q> as soon as they could do it with safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>While, on the contrary, there never has, in the history of the world, been seen a greater determination in any people to struggle, even unto death, for what they regard as their constitutional rights.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/> And, in this connection, you will pardon me, sir, for referring to another false impression, which you, perhaps unintentionally, have assisted in producing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I need hardly say that I refer to your recent speech before the <orgName n="Bible Society" type="society">Bible Society</orgName>, in which you, in a sneering manner, express the opinion that not <num value="500">five hundred</num> Bibles could be found in the whole of the <rs>Southern</rs> army; while at the same time you speak in the most glowing terms of the religious character of those you have sent forth to subjugate us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Robbery, house-burning, rape, desecration of churches and even graveyards have followed in its train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/> Having seen in this morning's <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> an editorial notice headed <q>&#x0022;Nurses Wanted&#x0022;</q> telling of the sufferings of the invalid soldiers to our hospitals who are in need of nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>the sufferers are pictured to my mind, and the question naturally arises, who are they ? They are the brave men who but a few weeks ago went forth in the pride and strength of manhood to do battle for the right &mdash; animated, perchance, by the gloving words of patriotism which fell over your lips, with the banners wrought by your hands waving proudly above them &mdash; determined never to let your gifts trail in the dust, but to follow whither so ever they fed, to <q>&#x0022;death or victory&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/> And they have returned, some with the noble handwork of their creator yet under fared; some alas, maimed and shattered, but all, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, whether home on the triumphant or the coach of pain, perchance of death have returned victorious; and while you twine the floral wreaths, forget not those conquerors who with mind and body weakened by the sufferings they have endured, are at your very desire crying for the crumbs which fall from your tables-- yes, for the very crumbs-- that least costly and unostentatious of his charities &mdash; kind words. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/> Many of the soldiers at our hospitals are far from their homes and loved ones, whose pleasure and privilege it would be to minister to their watts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Some are there youths, who have always been accustomed to the comforts of home and a monthers, watchful care, and who caused to privations, have found themselves unable to ordure the heirships of a soldier's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>To such an <num value="1">one</num>, stretched on a bed of suffering, heart sick and home sick, with no shame to his manhood, be it said, your presence would be that of a ministering angel-- They are not your sons, neither are they your Brothers, but some mother or sister would bless you with to is of thankfulness for every kindness shown to their loved and suffering ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It must, indeed, cause them a pang to know that to the dis act city, where those so <unclear></unclear> are lying ill, there are nurses wanted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/> There are difficulties to be announced but it might be so arranged that every lady could perform few hours daily in the hospitals.-- Let each have her daily circuit of sick rooms to visits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Be not content with sending them comforts and luxuries; go to them, not as casual visitor, but to whom be accustomed to your presence and sympathy, lay aside your costly dressed and wear the plainest you have, go prepared to smooth the pillow to bathe the burning brow and hold to the parched lip the can of cold water. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>You have responded nobly to the cause made upon you in behalf of these sufferers, but do not withhold from them that which they would prize more highly than all else in your power to bestow &mdash; the cheering influence of your presence.
