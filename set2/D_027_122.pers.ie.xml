<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>But the <rs>Montgomery</rs> pursued her with the utmost vigor wherever she went, and, after a long time, had so gained on her as to have her in full view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>She was a long white screw steamer, schooner-rigged, with <num value="2">two</num> smoke-stacks, and answered the description of the pirate <rs>Tallahassee</rs>; and no sooner was this known than the <rs>Montgomery</rs>'s crew were wild with joy. --Shortly afterwards the rebel flag was visible, and a war pendant was flying from her mainmast. </p> </q><bibl n="account"></bibl></cit>
