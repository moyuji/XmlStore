<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>We especially recommend this policy to the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName>; and to the <rs>Governor</rs> we would venture to propound the question, whether the matter is not of a sufficiently serious nature to justify the call of an extra session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>There can be no reason in the world why these men should not be subjected to the conscription as well as other persons; and the legislation which should make them so would be the most popular legislation it is possible to think of. </item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>We have no idea of the number of men detailed on special duty, or for special objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Some of these details are absolutely necessary; but we have no doubt that, if the system were revised, the business would go on quite as well and the army be greatly the gainer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is necessary, for instance, to detail large numbers for agricultural purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The army and the population must be fed; crops must be planted; bread must be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Yet we are satisfied that, in the details for agricultural purposes, great reforms might be made and a large accession of numbers gained by the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>In some places too many men have been taken off by the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>This is more especially the case in the mountain counties, where there are few negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>In other parts of the country too many have been left if the distribution of the burthens of war with impartiality be an object with those having authority, as we are sure it is. With regard to manufacturing, the case is somewhat different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Skilled workmen are not so numerous as we could wish them to be; and our army must have clothes, shoes, hats, arms and gunpowder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But in all these operations there are many persons employed who have little or no skill, and who might be substituted by older men, and, in many cases, by negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>In fact, it is a great abuse, in any case, to employ white men of conscript age where negroes could do the work quite as well.--There should not be a white driver, for instance, in the service, unless in cases in which uncommon intelligence is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>There is a large number of deserters in the counties lately occupied, but now abandoned, by the enemy, who might, with a little exertion, be brought back to their colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>They, in general never see the newspapers, and therefore do not know that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has offered them a free pardon on condition of their rejoining their ranks by a certain day. At present, the larger part are detained by a feeling of shame and the fear of being tried and shot as deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Many of them &mdash; we believe the majority &mdash; never meant to desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>They merely went to their homes on furlough, and while there, their return to camp was cut off by the enemy making a sudden movement and taking possession of their counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Most of these men could be brought back if they could see the offer of pardon made to them in <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s proclamation.

<item n="4"> <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The conscription has been very general wherever the officers could reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>But in some of the counties occupied until lately by the enemy there are numbers of men of conscript age who have not been enrolled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>In <num value="1">one</num> county alone we have been assured that there were more than <num value="200">two hundred</num>, and that we take to be hardly the average number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>We doubt, indeed, if it be not the <hi rend="italics">minimum</hi> if we confine our investigations to the frontier counties.--Means ought surely to be taken to bring in all these persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/></item> </list> 
<p> The duties of the <rs type="place">Bureau of Conscription</rs> have been, and continue to be, discharged with great intelligence, industry and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>But they extend no farther than to the ascertaining of the whereabouts and <hi rend="italics">status</hi> of the conscript, and the turning of him over to the military authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>What may then be done with him, it is no part of the business or duty of that officer to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>If he be detailed, or desert, or be made a justice of the peace, or a mail carrier, it is certainly no fault of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>In some <num value="1">one</num> or other of these ways, and not because the proper return was not made, the country has been robbed, of the services of a large army, which, properly employed, might have secured most important advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It is not too late now to secure the services of much the larger part of these men; and we hope those in whose power it lies &mdash; whether State Legislatures or the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities &mdash; will do it. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
