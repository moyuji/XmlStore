<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>New Orleans is in the possession of the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> This is a heavy blow; it is useless to deny it. But we were anticipating it, and the public mind had already become prepared for it, before the truth had been fully ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It is a heavy blow, but it is very far from being a fatal blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We may expect to hear of disasters wherever the enemy's gunboats can be brought to bear, on all the points still in our possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Give him all of them &mdash; every <num value="1">one</num>--and still he is as far from his object as he was this time last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>But our great armies are still in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>They have not fallen &mdash; they have not been worsted &mdash; they have always beaten the enemy, wherever they have encountered him. When they shall have been beaten and dispersed, so that they can never rally again, then it may be time to feel gloomy about our prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Until that time shall have arrived, it were unmanly to despond, far less to think of abandoning the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Even then the last resource of a brave nation, resolved not to be enslaved, remains to us. We can even then, as other nations have done before us, resolve ourselves into a guerilla force, composed of the whole country, and fight the battle for life or death, throughout a million of square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>But many of the brave troops from that side of the river are with us, and those that are there will still keep up the fight, in spite of their isolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>They will thus constantly employ a large portion of the enemy's army, and serve as a powerful diversion in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>If every seaboard town in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and every river town which can be reached by gunboats, were in the possession of the enemy to-morrow, it would not have the slightest effect upon the issue of this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It would not be so disastrous as a defeat of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, or give half the same cause for despondency.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The event of this war is still as much in the hands of our people as it was before the fell of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Having made himself-master of the river and seaboard towns, the enemy, if he wish to conquer us, must come into the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>There he will have to beat our armies, without the aid of his iron-clad boats, before he can boart of having subdued the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>In the meantime the occupation of so many points must necessarily tend to the weakening of his strength upon those points on which the grand issue is to be decided, and thus far his success is scarcely a disadvantage to us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>We do not ascertain this fact alone from Southern sources of information, although they are quite numerous and reliable, but the <rs>Northern</rs> letter writers all agree in the same statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>It is the spirit of endurance, a spirit even more rare than that which wins battlefields, and without which no people have ever yet achieved their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The people of these cities not only refuse to perjure themselves by taking an oath of allegiance which they do not mean to keep, but they exhibit a studied reserve and dignity in their intercourse with the invaders which has already satisfied them that the alleged Union sentiment of the <rs>South</rs> is a myth &mdash; a thing which, if <unclear></unclear> ever existed, exists no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> In regard to the oath of allegiance, we trust that the example set by the patriotic people of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and other localities, will continue to be universally followed at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/> I have received and read your speech with the deepest interest and attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>It traces the present crisis to its source, and points out the means of avoiding its <unclear>consequences </unclear> with perfect clearness, without passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>It appeals to our reason, and asks only justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>It will not perhaps be so much praised as some others; but hereafter when its prediction will be fulfilled, as I presume they will be ere long, you will be quoted as <num value="1">one</num> who foretold the danger, and pointed out the only means by which it could be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>It gives me pleasure to see that you take the same ground, with <num value="1">one</num> exception, which I assumed in a pamphlet I had prepared on the same subject, but for which I could find no publisher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>I was also desirous of publishing a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> edition of a work of mine on slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/><unclear></unclear> now out of print but was met by the same <unclear> oust </unclear> The literary as well as the political press is enthralled in the <rs>North</rs> and <hi rend="italics">Audi altarrem parism</hi> becomes an <unclear>obsolete</unclear> maxim. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/> If you will permit me, I will suggest to you a doubt of the policy as well as efficacy of the guarantees you propose for the future safety of the <rs>South</rs>, which will be equally denounced with the <rs>Constitution</rs> as &#x0022;violations of the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the rights of nature by the fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>They will be but burnt flax in the fiery furnace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>I mention this, because it would seem that several of the representatives of the <rs>South</rs> are not prepared to go with you to that extent; and, as I have formerly stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>I think unanimity of the last consequence to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>It astonishes me to see the distinction of parties still kept up in that quarter, and that when such momentous interests are at stake instead of embarking to a man in <num value="1">one</num> bottom, each <num value="1">one</num> <unclear></unclear> his own plank and paddles away in different directions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/> I cannot express the contempt and disgust with which I have to read the speech of our <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00333" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, though it is just what I expected from him. He is <num value="1">one</num> of the most dangerous insects that ever crawled about in the political atmosphere, for he is held in such after contempt by all honest men that no notice is taken of him till his sling is felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>He is only qualified to play the most despicable parts in the political drama, and the only possible way he can acquire distinction is by becoming the tool of greater scoundrels than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>Some years ago, after disgracing the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> as <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>, he found his lowest depths of insignificance and oblivion, and was dropped by his own party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>But the mud has been lately stirred at the very bottom of the pool, and he who went down a mutilated tadpole has come up a full-grown bullfrog, more noisy and impudent than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>This is very often the case among us here, where nothing is more common than to see a swindling rogue, after his crimes have been a little rusted by time, suddenly become an object of popular favor of executive patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>The position taken and the principles asserted by this pettifogging rogue in his speech would disgrace any man &mdash; but himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/> I fear it will not be long before we of the <rs>North</rs> become the tools of the descendants of the old <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs>, who had the most remote idea of the principles of civil liberty and no conception of religious toleration, but the most unrelenting in tolerance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>The despotism of persons is taking of <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>; and the gown and the petticoat have conspired to usurp the breaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>Our freedom is in great danger of being sacrificed to texts of Scripture, and fanatical dog man; the <num value="12">Twelve</num> Tables are becoming our law, and we shall be obliged to study the <name>Pandects</name> of Leviticus. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/> I fear, too, you will be tempted to trespass too much on your strength in defending yourselves from your foes and <hi rend="italics">friends.</hi> Let me beg you to hear in mind that at your age and mine, nature is not often strong enough to make more than <num value="1">one</num> rally, and that every successive effort is productive not of vigor, but exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Remember that in all probability the future will require your exertions, as well as the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>I rejoice to hear the favorable opinion of your physicians.
