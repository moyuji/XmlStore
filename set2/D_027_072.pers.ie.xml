<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At this point the successful portion of the raid ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The engineer tried to escape, but, apparently, for want of steam, made a slow business of getting away, and the exultant <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had nearly gotten to him, when the discharge of a regiment of rifles into their ranks showed them that they had been tolled into an ambush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The party who had been sent to burn the bridge were so alarmed at the hurried return of their comrades, that they ran off without completing their work, only a small portion of the bridge being injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The regiment of Confederates which executed this little piece of work was an infantry regiment stationed in the neighborhood, belonging to a brigade which it would not be prudent to name, but which can be found by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> by applying in that neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The commander, hearing of the proximity of the enemy, used the locomotive device to bring them in, and succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> We have it from undoubted authority, and We record it for the benefit of future historian of this war &mdash; who will derive a large portion of their materials from the contemporary press &mdash; that the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers gathered up on the field of <rs n="Battle of the Wilderness" type="battle">battle of the Wilderness</rs> upwards of <num value="57000">fifty-seven thousand</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The inference to which this fact leads cannot be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Victorious soldiers do not throw away their arms; routed soldiers very generally do. Ergo, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s soldiers were routed, and he himself was a badly beaten General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It indicates, also, a slaughter much greater than was acknowledged by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who put their whole loss down at <num value="35000">thirty-five thousand</num>, killed, wounded and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>If the number was so small, it follows that, allowing none others than infantry to have been slain or wounded, <num value="22000">twenty-two thousand</num> muskets were thrown away by men who were not hurt at all. A prodigious rout it must be to produce such results; much greater than was actually the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It is reasonable, however, to suppose that the other arms of the service suffered, at least, in some degree, whereas the muskets picked up represent only infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The fair conclusion is, that the enemy had vastly more men killed and wounded than is stated above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The impudence of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in claiming a victory in the face of such testimony is astonishing.--it is even more so, when We remember that he moved off, leaving his dead unburied and vast numbers of his wounded in our hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> from the same source from which We derived the above intelligence, We learned that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> opened the campaign with <num value="150000">one hundred and fifty thousand</num> men. He had modelled his operations upon the great <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> campaigns of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, alluded to by us the other day. He expected to turn the right flank of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, cut him off from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and destroy him, or drive him to the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Then he would march upon <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and enter it in triumph at the head of a victorious army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The Northern papers all said that was his plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The theory was beautiful, and if <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had not been of a most unaccommodating nature, the success would have been correspondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>But he refused to be beaten, and as his defeat formed an important part of the theory, and had been taken for granted in constructing it, the whole structure came to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, however, says his achievements during this campaign have surpassed all the achievements of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>They have not thus far, however, proved quite so successful as some of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s; that is to say, the results have not been quite as great. &#x0022;it is you, <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName>,&#x0022; (says <persName n="Junius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Junius,nomatch:0"><surname>Junius</surname></persName> to <persName n="Draper,Sir,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="default:Draper,William,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Draper</surname></persName>, who had immoderately praised the <rs>Marquis</rs> of <placeName reg="Granby, Newton, Missouri" key="tgn,2058926">Granby</placeName>,) &#x0022;who make your friend appear ridiculous by dressing him in a laced suit of tawdry qualifications which nature never intended him to wear.&#x0022; We wonder this idea has never struck the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journalists when burning incense to their military idols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He has been all his life passionately addicted to field sports and wood craft, in both of which he is said to excel most men of his day. <num value="1">One</num> faculty, of the last importance to an officer holding such a command as his, he is said to possess in a very remarkable degree &mdash; that, namely, of becoming acquainted instantly, and almost instinctively, with all the features of whatever locality he may happen to pass over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>To such an extent is this faculty developed that we have heard it said, if he were blindfolded and carried <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> into a forest in which he had never been before, he would find out where he was in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> after the removal of the bandage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>he never camps a day in a neighborhood without making himself sufficiently acquainted with all the roads, byroads and hog-paths, to act as a guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Yet no man is more impetuous in the charge, or more rapid in the pursuit.--<persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> possesses another qualification very important in a cavalry officer, and yet not always possessed even by <hi rend="italics">good</hi> cavalry officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>He is passionately fond of horses, and an uncommonly fine judge of them; takes a pleasure in studying their nature and wants, and thus affords the best guarantee that he will make his men attend to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>When we add that he is a splendid rider, a practiced swordsman, and an excellent shot; but above all, that he is what <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> calls &#x0022;an <hi rend="italics">earnest</hi> man,&#x0022; with no frivolity or childishness about him, but devoted with all the deep enthusiasm of his nature to the cause in which he is engaged, we have said enough, we think, to show that the cavalry of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> is in very good hands. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
