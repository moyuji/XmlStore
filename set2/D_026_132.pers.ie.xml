<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> I may remark in passing that my observation of the people during this expedition has modified my previous notions of the &#x0022;Crackers&#x0022; The men are generally fine looking, tall, manly fellows, and in spits of their want of education, intelligent and clear headed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Those that we met were almost all for the <rs>Union</rs> without slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> The next day we were joined by a large number of Union men. We stopped for the night at the house of a farmer, a deserter from the rebel army, who had been hiding in the woods for more than <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>He is gradually moving down to the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> to unite his forces with those of Beast <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00264" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, when, if ever, he may pluck up courage enough to try the mettle of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00265" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fits,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s men once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>That he will do so before this Junction shall have been made we do not expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>After all &mdash; that is after he shall have joined Butter &mdash; he may prefer the slow process of entrenching, to the more rapid, but less promising, method of carrying our works by storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The lessons of <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName> have tamed him down prodigiously, and what is worse for him, they have considerably abated the courage of his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Should he undertake a singe his case is quite as hopeless as it would be should he attempt an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>With an army so nearly equal to him in numbers that it is able to beat him in a fair field in his front, he cannot invest <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>There are croakers here, as we suppose there would be in Paradies, who are greatly horrified at the prospect of a sledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Let such weak-kneed disciples be at peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>An army which has been so thoroughly whipped as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s, is not going to besiege the army that whipped it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>We feel perfectly secure with <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fits,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his army between us and the enemy, and well assured that the campaign, terminate when it may, will be to us a triumphant success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> From <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Georgia</placeName>, we publish cheering news this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>On the contrary, he has exacted a heavy toll in blood for every foot of the way he has travelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>He himself tells us, in the telegram which we publish this morning, that the numerous combats in which he has been engaged, amount in their results to a battle; of course he means to a successful battle, for the advantage has been greatly in his favor.--The public, as is the habit of those who know nothing of military matters, have judged <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00270" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> too hastily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>He has evidently retreated upon a preconceived plan, and just as evidently knows perfectly well what he is about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>He has shown no symptoms of haste, no signs of trepidation, not the least glimpse of fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>His movements betray a mind perfectly master of itself, of the situation, and of the plan predetermined upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>When the country shall have found him hesitating, uncertain, and unbalanced, then it will be time enough to take the alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We see nothing of this; nor, in our opinion, will we see anything of it. <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s movements indicate a settled purpose as clearly as any we have noticed since this war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We look forward to his finishing this campaign with glory to himself and the highest advantage to the country. </p> </div3>

<head>The atrocities of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> In a letter to his Minister at <placeName key="tgn,7003474" n="1.000 2" reg="kobenhavn,kobenhavn,danmark,europe">Copenhagen</placeName>, dated <date value="1863-04-14">14th April, 1863, </date> <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> said: &#x0022;It looks as if, by another year, we can put down the rebellion by starvation, if in no other way.&#x0022; This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hint of that system which has since been deliberately and persistently followed by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies, and which has given rise to cruelties such as the world has never witnessed since the irruption of the <rs>Northern</rs> barbarians into the provinces of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Empire, unless, it may be, in the war of the <name>Turks</name> upon the <name>Greeks</name>, or in the civil war, of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and the <rs>Spanish States</rs> of <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government has systematically engaged in the project of starving <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of people, men, women, and children, whom it has found it impossible to subdues by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>In the pursuit of this horrible object the simplest dictates of humanity are utterly disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Murders are of every day occurrence, and still more numerous are the instances in which every possible means of subsistence are destroyed, and the inhabitants left to starve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>We published yesterday a statement of the process pursued in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Georgia</placeName>, where the farmer is compelled to give an inventory of his horses, stock, grain, farming utensils, &#x0026;c., and is punished by death if such inventory be found defective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> It is impossible that a day of retribution should not come for such crimes as are perpetrated by these devils in human shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It were impeaching the justice of the <rs>Supreme Being</rs> to imagine otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>In all history we recollect scarcely an instance in which great national crimes have not been visited upon the perpetrators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>These atrocities do good to no <num value="1">one</num>--not to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, because they cannot enjoy what they are engaged in destroying &mdash; not, of course, to the <rs>Confederates</rs>, whom it is the object of them to annoy &mdash; not to the negroes, to woo, in a great measure, the execution is entrusted.--It is hoped to subdue the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> by such measures, the hope is vain.--Such wanton injuries inflame the resentment of the people, and leave but <num value="1">one</num> mind, <num value="1">one</num> heart, and <num value="1">one</num> purpose, in the whole Confederacy.
