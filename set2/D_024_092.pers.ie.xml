<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> I regret that some gentlemen have thought proper to make invidious allusion to the small number of votes from my district, polled at our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> election, to point their arguments in favor of applying the &#x0022;general ticket system&#x0022; to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If they would infer from the small number of votes and from the choice made of myself, that such constituencies ought not to be instructed with the right of election, it does not become me to defend the choice which they have once made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>But I must take some notice of the allusion to my district. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> It must be known to the <rs type="place">House</rs> that even before the war began that district was occupied by hostile troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>From that day until now not a Confederate soldier has ever been within the district, or within a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> of the place of my residence, except as a prisoner in the hands of the enemy.--Even before our ordinance of secession was ratified, there of my constituents who desired to join the army of the <rs>State</rs> were compelled to escape by stratagem through lines guarded by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>So brief was the warning, so unexpected was the invasion, and so difficult was escape, that only a few were within our lines at the time of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The number is now much greater, although our Government has never been able to protect that country, or to keep open communication with it. The few who were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> driven from their homes by the approach of the enemy were mainly representative men. Intelligent, influential and prominent supporters of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, they were specially obnoxious to the hatred of the invaders and traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approach of invasion they were compelled to choose between submission and exile.--They promptly gave up their homes, property, and nearly all that men hold dear, saving for themselves nothing but the precious liberty of serving their country during this terrible war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Of the little band of voters from my district, whose <unclear>mea</unclear> number has been the subject of such slighting allusion the number has already become less since our last election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Not all their names are now heard at morning or evening, when the rolls of our renowned armies are called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> I read with unusual interest and satisfaction the debate which occurred in the <name>Senate</name> on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, upon the resolution of <persName n="Trumbull,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>, and desire to express my thanks for the sentiments and thoughts which the occasion elicited from you. My convictions and sympathies are with you thoroughly when you say, &#x0022;I do not believe that it (imprisonment upon <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">lettres de caches</hi></foreign>) promotes the purposes of those who desire to see this Union brought together again an object, of all others to me the most desirable, if it be possible.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> In my estimation, the mover of the inquiry deserves the gratitude of freemen everywhere, and only utters truth with force when he declares that &#x0022;the power, without charge, without examination, without opportunity of reply, at the click of the telegraph, to arrest a man in a peaceable portion of the country and imprison him&#x0022; is &#x0022;of the essence of despotism.&#x0022; And yet the public mind thus far would seem to have been scarcely more roused by current events of this character than it was years ago when we received accounts of similar incarcerations ordered by the father of the now deposed <rs type="role">King</rs> of the <num value="2">Two</num> <unclear> Sicilles.</unclear> How incredible it will appear hereafter, when history shall be written up, that at this period of the <rs>Republic</rs> the constitutional safe guards of personal liberty could have been so easily and with so little apparent concern <unclear>swet</unclear> away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="20">20th ultimo</day></dateStruct> <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> after the debate in which you participated, addressed an <hi rend="italics">official</hi> note to me which seems to illustrate, in a striking manner, the slight grounds, or rather the groundless suspicious, upon which, in those times, citizens are liable to suffer in reputation, if not in loss of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>I replied without delay, and, so far as I am personally affected, may. I trust, well leave the matter in quietness upon the files of the <name>Department</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>It is my belief, however, that no recent measure has been fraught with more mischief than the issuing of <hi rend="italics">lettres de cachet,</hi> and consequent arrests and imprisonments in violation of the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and that the earlier the system is effectually checked the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It will be for the <rs>Government</rs> and the country, as well as for the subjects of oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The evidence is abundant to show that the plea of <hi rend="italics">necessity,</hi> except in the presence or immediate neighborhood of hostile armies, where the administration of law, under its usual forms, may be <unclear>inevitakly</unclear> suspended, is not graciously accepted by the mass of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Union, without security for personal liberty, is not the <rs>Union</rs> which they have cherished, and to the restoration of which they took with earnest desire and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Nothing, perhaps, could express more clearly their views on this point than the language of the great modern historian, who died at a comparatively recent period, leaving his work incomplete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>In tracing the successive steps in the progress of <name>British</name> liberty, <persName n="Macaulsy,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Macaulsy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Macaulsy</surname></persName> says: <q>&#x0022;We have been taught by long experience, that we cannot without danger suffer any breach of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to pass unnoticed.&#x0022;</q> &#x0022;As we cannot, without the risk of evils from which imagination recoils, employ physical force as a check on misgovernment, it is evidently our wisdom to keep all constitutional checks on misgovernment in the highest state of efficiency &mdash; to watch with jealousy the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> beginnings of encroachment, and never to suffer irregularities, even when harmless in themselves, to pass unchallenged lest they acquire the force of precedents.&#x0022; Who in our land will affirm that any other doctrine is worthy of those who hold their rights under a solemn written charter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It is cheering to know that inquiry has been moved in the right quarter, and that able and fearless men are stirred by a sense of what is due to our fellow citizens, who have been imprisoned without assignment of cause and discharged without explanation; and yet more, to such as are still in confinement, and precluded by guards and prison-bolts from the privilege of the &#x0022;great writ of liberty,&#x0022; and thus of confronting before a competent judicial tribunal suggestion of crime, which the act of <sic>imprisoment</sic> itself implies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Of this latter class, I believe, from my knowledge of the man, are not a few worthy sons of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, who love the <rs>Union</rs> as you do, and who have striven not to destroy, but to preserve it. If free from any taint of crime, as I take them to be, they will derive unfailing capacity for endurance from the consciousness that they have never nourished their manly strength to strike stout blows at the foundation which the fathers laid &mdash; that they have never participated in lines of action, or in <unclear></unclear> utterances, calculated to encourage aggression upon the rights and institutions of sovereign States--to foster sectional distrust and animosity, or to inaugurate conflict between different parts of the <name>Confederation</name>, and thus to weaken unity of feeling, interest, and purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>If on the other hand, they are guilty, the law will conflict adequate punishment, whatever that may be, as it should do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>This applies with especial force to those, who are nearest the scene of action, whilst those who are most distant should make up by promptness of action the disadvantages of remoteness from the theatre of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>In deciding what we can spare from the necessities of our households we should be ready to deny ourselves, and to live, if necessary, on half rations for the sake of the army, as the army has often done for our sake.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> Many a saddened heart will bleed at this melancholy announcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>In the morning of her life the &#x0022;insatiate archer&#x0022; had marked her for his own; yet for many years she was spared, through the merciful goodness of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>--a shining light and centre of attraction to her family circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Young, beautiful, with all that could adorn the character of woman in mind and disposition, she had attached to her many warm and devoted friends in the home of her childhood and in the later home of her adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Ever modest and retiring in her manners, sincere is her friendship, firm, in her convictions of right and of duty, without guile, gentle, loving, kind she was a bright example of a pure and lovely woman. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The duties of domestic life were discharged by her with rare fidelity, and every claim of natural affection was responded to with a depth of love as, tender as it was faithful; as wife, ever amiable, fond, and devoted; as daughter, ever dutiful, loving, and respectful; as sister, ever generous, kind, and affectionate; as friend, ever disinterested, faithful and self sacrificing as member of the <orgName n="Baptist Church" type="church">Baptist Church</orgName>, ever kindly affectionate to her fellow Christians of her own and of other denominations; she has gone down to an early grave, beloved, admired, and regretted by all who know her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The deceased was the victim of that fearful and relentless disease &mdash; consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>For nearly <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> she had been a constant sufferer to the ravages of disease; and yet in the midst of excruciating pain and of weariness, during this long period, and the chilling prospects of approaching death, deferred from year to year, contrary to the expectations of her physicians and friends, she was never known to murmur, having borne her every affliction with a degree of fortitude and <name>Christian</name> resignation rarely equalled never excelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Through sorrow and pain and tribulation, triumphant at last made perfect through suffering, glorifying <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, with perfect resignation to His will, and a blissful confidence in the merits of her Saviour, she prayed unto her <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name> that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He would, in the bountifulness of His mercy, free her of pain and permit her to die easy, calm, and composed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> A short time afterwards she calmly, and in tones of angelic sweetness, said, &#x0022;Dear, I know that I am dying and must soon be gone;&#x0022; she deliberately gave directions in regard to her burial; to her husband, an affectionate farewell for himself, for her parents, and her sisters, with injunctions to each to prepare to meet her on that happy shore where parting would be no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Her voice had now become extremely feeble, and soon after she quietly sank into a peaceful slumber; awakening, she cast a last fond look of affection upon her companion and the dear friends gathered around her bed side, and as a gentle and wearied infant unconsciously falls to sleep, she closed forever her lovely eyes, and without the slightest struggle or the least apparent pain breathed her last breath calmly, softly sweetly; as her pure spirit passed from earth to Daven. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> It is unnecessary to remind those who knew and loved <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Maria,,Ann,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="default:Maria,Ann,,,"><foreName>Ann</foreName> <surname>Maria</surname></persName></hi> of the gentleness the patience, the grateful sense and lovely manners that not only adorned the singular beauty of her youth, but survived, even unto the last, the pains and corrosions of slow and relentless disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The <name>Christian</name> experience of the deceased, her glorious triumph in death, and the manifestations of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to her do parting soul, are lessons of mystery, of beauty, of awful power, of tender and eternal eloquence, upon which we could dwell, not blinded by tears, but looking up through sunlight and smiling skies praising <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who turneth night into day and maketh even the mystery and shadow of-death a light to all believers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> &#x0022;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> It was sad and heartrending to witness for years, the sufferings of <num value="1">one</num> so dearly beloved, and to look upon a form so lovely, with a spirit so noble and generous, gradually and surely declining under the ravages of that insidious destroyer, the consumption; but when the withering of the flower day by day develops the ripening of the fruit, and when the raspers come to gather the rich harvest to the skies, the hearts that cling to the loved <num value="1">one</num> with fondest affection bid sorrow give place to hope; and he whose heart is shrouded in deepest gloom sees through the thick darkness the morning star of hope, heralding forth the bright day of eternity when he shall be re-united to the object of his affections, to be separated up more forever. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2>
