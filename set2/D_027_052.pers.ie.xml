<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> suggests a new and remarkable ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It is <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> for the <name>Presidency</name> and <persName n="Farragut,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Farragut</surname></persName> for the <name>Vice</name>-Presidency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>This is what may be called an amphibious ticket; or, at any rate, it is &#x0022;half horse and half alligator. &#x0022; It is a union of those antidotes, the <name>Soldier</name> and the <name>Sailor</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Perhaps we should call it a horse-marine ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It might be caricatured by a donkey, representing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with a straight, starched soldier riding in front, and a fat, paunchy sailor, accustomed to the quarter-deck, astride of the donkey's quarters, with his face to the stern, and holding on to the tail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>A donkey who &#x0022;wouldn't go&#x0022; under such circumstances would prove that nature never intended him for a war-horse, and ought to be turned out to grass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Farragut,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><surname>Farragut</surname></persName>, each at home in his own profession, would be equally at sea on board the <rs type="ship">Ship</rs> of State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Their profound destitution of political knowledge would be rather a benefit than otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Being ignorant of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, they might occasionally, by mistake, carry out some of its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>They could not possibly sin against light and knowledge, and might commit some virtuous action from want of knowing better. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> It is a pleasant thing to sit in <num value="1">one</num>'s house and hear a company of gentlemen outside discussing the question of who shall have the honor of robbing the house and murdering the inmates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The instrumentality and the mode of accomplishing their objects are dilated with a degree of energy and ability that we might appreciate more highly under different circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Some are in favor of cutting all our throats in-our beds; others of hanging us to the bedposts; others, with a touch of chivalry that reminds us of the dark ages, propose to demand <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a parley, and civilly request us to give up the keys before proceeding to extremities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>This we understand to be the <hi rend="italics">Herald's</hi> position, and the new ticket of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Farragut,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><surname>Farragut</surname></persName> to represent that idea. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> There are people so unreasonable as to say that if we are to be killed at last, we may as well be killed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and that the mode of killing is as indifferent as the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>This is an unphilosophical view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>We have got to die some time, yet we all try to live as long as we can. There is a choice, too, between death by a slow decay of the faculties or by cancer in the stomach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Tastes differ also as to having the throat cut or being knocked in the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We are not without interest, therefore, in the discussions going on outside as to the manner of our extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Whether the <name>Chimpanzee</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> shall boat our brains out with his big club, or a regular professional practitioner put us to death <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">secundem artem,</hi></foreign> for the benefit of science, is a question not beneath the consideration of enlightened minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>He has been for many years endeavoring to sew seeds of distrust and discord between the <num value="2">two</num>, and at last, in consequence of his skillful intrigues, they have dissolved partnership and got to actual blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>It fills his soul with anguish and his eyes with tears. --Somebody asks him to interfere, but, bless you, no; that would only make it worse, don't you see; and he wouldn't for the world aggravate such horrors.-- So, with a breaking heart and a funereal countenance, he hands a revolver to <num value="1">one</num> and a bowie-knife to the other, and as each loses his weapon, charitably supplies another in its place.
