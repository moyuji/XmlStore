<head>The negro and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> Nobody in the seceded States has ever placed the slightest faith in the professions of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> relative to the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> has been bamboozled through her corrupt representatives in Congress into the impression that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> crusade was not <num value="1">one</num> against the right of property as well as the political rights of the <rs>Southern</rs> communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But even <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is now insulted in her helplessness by that power whose cruelty and rapacity will always be proportionate to its means of indulging those predominating traits of theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Yet we have seen them professing to respect the rights of property, and by some of their military orders giving occasion of complaint to the rabid abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>This was a mere ruse to serve the purpose of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Their malignity to the <rs>South</rs> will stop at nothing, however monstrous, that may be deemed effective in the prosecution of the main purpose of the complete spoliation and humiliation of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>With no moral sense of obligation to constitutions and laws, or to humanity itself, they will do just whatever they may deem best calculated to strengthen themselves at home and promote the object of subjugating and destroying the nationality of the <rs>South</rs>.--So we have seen them, after avowing their determination to respect the right of property, and their disinclination to disturb the relations of master and slave, abolish slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, to propitiate the abolition sentiments and silence the growing complaint of the fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Everybody knows the <name>Demons</name> of the <rs>Federal</rs> metropolis would this very day, if they thought that the best way to <q>&#x0022;crush the rebellion,&#x0022;</q> put arms in the hands of the slaves, and make them the agents of their diabolical crusade; --not only would they do this by arms, but by other and more secret means, more in keeping with the fiendish inclinations of the head and front of the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>We believe now that the chief obstacle in the way of an active movement with this view, is the conviction that the <rs>Southern</rs> slave is not the being they took him to be. To the credit of that individual, he has shown more consideration for the master, for the people amongst whom he has been born and raised, than the hypocrites who profess so much sympathy for him. He has remained at his home, performing his duties faithfully and obediently, and much the larger portion of the negroes in the invaded districts have evinced a dread of the invaders, and clung devotedly to their owners and their families &mdash; to the happy homes and peaceful mansions where the sunshine of contentment and happiness has gilded all the days of their lives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/><num value="1">One</num> of them is a letter from a very prominent officer in the <rs>Federal</rs> army, making notable acknowledgements as to the social and physical condition of the slave, and declaring that the charge that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> intended to liberate the negro was a <q>&#x0022;lie; &#x0022;</q> the other is the famous order of <persName n="Hunter,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="nearbymention:Hunter,David,,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, which abolishes, by <num value="1">one</num> scratch of the pen, slavery in the vast region of country covered by <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>' <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The letter is from the pen of <persName n="Gibson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gibson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, who commands the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 49">49th regiment</orgName> of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>The Lincoln Government has been engaged in abolition ever since it begun the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It was put off for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/> --Night kissed the young rose, and it bent softly upon its blushing bosom, and watched its pure slumber.--Morning came with her dancing breezes, and it awoke joyous and smiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Lightly it danced to and fro in the loveliness of health and youthful innocence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/> Then came the ardent sun-<name n="God" type="God">god</name> sweeping from the <rs>East</rs>, and he smote the young rose with his golden shaft, and it fainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Deserted and almost heart-broken, it dropped to the dust in its loveliness and despair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> Now the gentle breeze who had been gamboling over the sea, pushing on the light barque, sweeping over hill and dale &mdash; by neat cottage and the still brook &mdash; fanning the fevered brow of disease, and tossing the curls of innocent childhood &mdash; came tripping along on the errands of mercy and love; and when she hastened to kiss it, and fondly bathed its forehead in cold, refreshing showers, the young rose revived, looked up and smiled, flung its ruddy arms as if in gratitude to embrace the breeze; but she hurried quickly away when her generous task was performed &mdash; yet not without reward, for she soon perceived that a delicious fragrance had been poured on her wing by the grateful rose, and the kind breeze was glad in her heart, and went away singing through the tress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> Thus charity, like the breeze which gathers a fragrance from the humble flowers it refreshes, unconsciously reaps a reward in the performance of offices of kindness and love, which steals through the heart like a rich perfume to bless and to cheer. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
