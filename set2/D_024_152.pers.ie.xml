<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, which always announces contemplated enterprises of the enemy with so much accuracy that it is believed by many to dilate them, told us a week or more ago, that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was playing a rash game in removing his army from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, for that the great warrior, <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName>, would be sure to take advantage of his absence and pounce upon it. Finding this threat of no avail, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General is now endeavoring to carry it out, to the extent at least of a demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It will not do. Not a man, not a horse, not a gun, will be withdraws from the <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName>, and <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName> will not take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We have a force amply sufficient to drive him back, and perhaps to capture his whole command, even without the assistance of the citizens, who are armed, organized, and prepared for action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The equanimity of the city is not, in the slightest degree, disturbed by the new demonstration, and the only fear we hear expressed is that <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName> will take counsel of his discretion and retire, before he shall have gotten too far from his gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We have it from high authority, that not only the city is in no danger, but that we are in a condition to chastise the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> if they dare advance, in such a manner that they will not be in a hurry to repeat the experiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> It is obvious that <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName> does not expect to capture <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>His whole design is to frighten the citizens to such an extent that they shall demand the protection of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and thus mar the great enterprise upon which he is bent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>What that enterprise may be &mdash; whether it aims at the capture of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and the disenthralled and regeneration of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--or at the invasion of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, the capture of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and the transfer of the war to the heart of the enemy's country &mdash; or, finally, whether its object be merely to retaliate upon the enemy a few of the barbarities he has practiced against us &mdash; we know not. But, whatever may be the ultimate design, it is obvious that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s movements have stricken the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation with a terror, to which we never had a parallel in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Either to they have been playing a safe, and to them no doubt, a very amusing game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They have known nothing of the horrors of war, save so much as they may have read in newspapers, or heard described by returned soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They have never known what it was to have their houses pillaged and burned, their crops destroyed, their barns and mills emptied and reduced to ashes, their cattle slaughtered in sheer wantonness, and their families insulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They have read of all these things as perpetrated by their soldiers against us, and so far from sympathizing with us, they have incessantly cheered on the dogs of war as they were <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> loose upon us. Now the hour of retribution has struck, and the very terror with which they are stricken demonstrates, in a manner which cannot be mistaken, the spot which they are most vulnerable, the <unclear></unclear> which ought to be pressed most vigorously by our General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Doubtless he sees it more clearly than we do, and he will not be diverted from his object by any attempt upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> which it is in the power of <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName> to make. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The extracts from the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName> which we publish in another column, give a lively picture of the alarm which refuses to subside, but is rather on the increase in that city and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We are delighted to see this as we are also to see that our troops begin to retaliate upon the <name>Pennsylvanians</name>, some of the outrages they have been perpetrating against us. We hope they will take deep and signal revenge for the injuries that have been inflicted upon us. Their armies with their approval, have stolen <num value="500000">500,000</num> negroes from the <rs>South</rs>, valued at <measure n="500000000dollars" type="currency">$500,000,000</measure>, at the commencement of the war. They have no negroes to steal, but they have towns and manufactories to burn, and every <num value="1">one</num> of these should be reduced to ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Property is property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There is no reason why <num value="1">one</num> species of it should be exempt from the laws of war more than another.--Were our troops to burn <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>, the loss to the enemy would not counterbalance the loss we have sustained in the article of negroes alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We say, then, make the whole <placeName reg="Pennsylvania Valley">Pennsylvania Valley</placeName> an astonishment to future generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Let the traveller, in times to come, lift up his hands with amazement, as he does in those countries denounced in the Old Testament &mdash; once flourishing communities now howling wildernesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It was said that &#x0022;no blade of grass ever grew where the horse of <persName n="Attila,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Attila,nomatch:0"><surname>Attila</surname></persName> had once set his foot.&#x0022; Let the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> imitate the leader of the <name>Huns</name> in this particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The Valley of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> ought to become a sea of flame, like the prairies of the <orgName n="Western world" type="newspaper">Western world</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Nothing should be left that man could eat, or sleep up on, or shelter himself, or procure food with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>All this might be done &mdash; the land might be turned into a desert, and yet the balance of destruction would be against us. The whole city of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> if burnt to the ground would not pay for the negroes they have carried off. We are opposed to plundering &mdash; it ruins the discipline of an army, and turns it over an easy prey to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But we would have every house gutted, and the contents set on fire.--Thus only can we get even with this villainous foe, who has no compunctions of condolence, no regard for the laws of war, no respect for the usages of civilized society, no belief in the truths of Revelation, no fears of punishment in another world, no reverence for <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and no mercy for his fellow man. He should receive the measure that he has meted out to us &mdash; should receive it in full, and if he gets a little more than his due there is no great harm done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Revenge has been said to be &#x0022;a feast for the <name>Gods</name>.&#x0022; Yet it is not for the sake of vengeance alone that we should like to see the suffering that has been inflicted upon our people, visited on the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We believe it to be the true policy &mdash; the only means left us of bringing them to a sense of what belongs to humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The species of war which they are waging against us is not dictated by any hope of its being successful.--They know well enough that we are not to be conquered by devastating our fields and destroying our towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They wage this kind of war because they hate us, individually and collectively &mdash; hate every man, woman, and child in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The only way to stop it is to retaliate. </p> </div3>
