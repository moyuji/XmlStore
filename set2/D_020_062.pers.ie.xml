<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Many persons residing in the city say they heard the firing of guns from below last evening, and also at an early hour this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It is believed that there was a salute of some kind last evening at <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, a name even your most distant readers will understand to be almost synonymous with <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>; and there was probably a trial of some guns this morning at the <placeName key="tgn,2265633" n="1.000 8" reg="craney island, portsmouth, virginia">Craney Island</placeName> batteries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The report of heavy guns, by the way, is distinctly heard in the upper part of this city, and when the weather is favorable for the communication of sound, it can be heard at a much greater distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> is distant from this city &mdash; air line &mdash; only <measure n="11miles" type="distance">eleven miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The name <placeName key="tgn,1012257" n="1.000 3" reg="old point comfort, hampton, virginia">Point Comfort</placeName> was given to this noted location in <date value="1607">1607,</date> <q>&#x0022;on account of the good channel and safe anchorage it afforded,&#x0022;</q> and the word <q>&#x0022;old&#x0022;</q> distinguishes it from <placeName reg="New Point, Mathews, Virginia" key="tgn,2113229">New Point</placeName> Comfort. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The extensive and costly work of building the foundation of Castle <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> was commenced in <date value="1826">1826.</date> A temporary castle was subsequently built, and a few years ago, when it was ascertained that the foundation had ceased to settle down and had become perfectly firm, the heavy and rough masonry was removed, preparatory to the erection of a splendid fortress, which it is expected will be finished in good time by the C. S. A. <q>&#x0022;The present aspect of the place is rough and savage; the music of the surrounding elements of air and sea is in keeping with the dreariness and desolation of the spot.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> It is the opinion of wise men here that the work upon the <rs>Merrimac</rs> should be continuous; that a more full and efficient force--<num value="2">two</num> sets of hands &mdash; should be employed at night and on <date value="--7">Sundays</date>, in order to have her important services at an early day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> In looking over your most excellent, valuable and interesting columns, I was surprised at your number of correspondents from the <rs>East</rs>, and still more so at such a small number of effusions from the glorious <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the colonies alone have demanded more than live times the space of the entire building: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the earliest application for space was that of an inventor who, though he does not specify the nature of the articles he intends to exhibit, requires the space in every class of the industrial sections to the amount of <num value="72000">72,000</num> square feet!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It must be taken, we suppose, as a proof of the versatility of genius, that we always find the professions and trades of those intractable inventors have not the remotest connection with their valuable mechanical, chemical, and warlike discoveries.
