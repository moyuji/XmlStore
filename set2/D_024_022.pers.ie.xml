<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The question of customs duties also will spring up to complete the dissensions which the pressure of the debt will have began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>In the first place, it will be well nigh impossible for the <rs>North</rs> to maintain its present high tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The case has now become most urgent; for not only does international law justify our recognition of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, but humanity demands that we should take measures to put an end to so horrible a war.
