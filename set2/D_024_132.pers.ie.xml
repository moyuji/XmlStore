<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>That this celebrated man should be absent from the roll of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs> we could easily understand, the effect of Confederate bullets on the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> constitution being thoroughly appreciated by that worthy; but that such a chip of the old <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName> block should remain at home in inglorious case, whilst the <name>Butlers</name> and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were achieving elsewhere unfading laurels and cramming their pockets with untold plunder, was something wholly unaccountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We are indebted to the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName> for a solution of this strange phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Of these soldiers, about half went up from this city, on invitation, the expense of their transportation being defrayed by a subscription here, while at <placeName reg="Utica, Oneida, New York" key="tgn,7014679">Utica</placeName> the noblest women ministered to their wants with a bounteousness and sapidity which left nothing to desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> &#x0022;Gutting of houses&#x0022; is a terrible trade, and those who follow it are dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Like all fascinating occupations, it must be hard to abandon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The pirate must die a pirate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The freebooter can never be content to live honestly and earn an honest living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The man who has practiced the art of gutting houses and appropriating their contents to his own benefit, can never look at a decent house without feeling a desire to rifle it &mdash; to turn it inside out and possess themselves of the cream of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The accounts given in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers say that they &#x0022;gutted houses for squares in the negro quarter!&#x0022; and &#x0022;nearly all the negro huts were demolished and <hi rend="italics">their furniture taken away!</hi>&#x0022; &#x0022;Frightened woolly heads&#x0022; and &#x0022;rolling eye-balls tremblingly directed towards the soldiers,&#x0022; appear to have been very good marks for attack, and to have had no effect in mitigating their fury against the &#x0022;poor negro. &#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> But the house gutter will be hunting for more houses!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The negro hut is not compensating &mdash; it is not rich in spoils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Save to vent his hate to the negro the gutting of his house is not worth the trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>But if the ruling powers will only put under the ban some party of &#x0022;Copperheads,&#x0022; or a party with any sort of a name, then there would be prosperous work!
