<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We lost heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It could not well have been otherwise as the enemy's works were of the most formidable kind, and our men charged across an open field of some <measure n="1300yards" type="distance">thirteen hundred yards</measure> in extent.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> But I find that I am falling into the terror so common in the army, and indeed in the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>This feeling is increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>If not justified, when we recollect how quickly and successfully he penetrated <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s designs and anticipated him at the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, and especially when we recall the supernal prescience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Which enabled him to foresee and provide against the advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> army upon this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The case with which he unravels the most intricate combinations of his antagonist, the instructive knowledge which he seems to possess of all his plans and designs, and the certainty with which he moves his own army and makes his own dispositions, is truly wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>But, good and <unclear></unclear> as our chief is, there is a greater Power than he &mdash; a Power upon whom he leans, as the army leans up on himself, or a child upon a father; and <num value="1">one</num> must sometimes tremble, lost we be guilty of the monstrous crime of diverting from that beneficent Power the love and gratitude which are so justly due for the good fortune that has literally been showered upon our cause and country since the dawn of this blessed year of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>When we recall the disasters which attended our arms last year, the gloom which settled upon the hearts of the people during the winter, the miraculous inspiration that descended upon the army, and extended through the country, as the year unfolded its monthly leaves, and the series of brilliant and substantial, and unexpected victories that crowned our arms in rapid and almost bewildering succession in every part of the country, it would seem impossible for any son or daughter of this stricken land, be they Jew or Gentile, Pagan or <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, to rise from the contemplation except with a heart swelling with gratitude, and eyes brimming with tears of joy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> In a recent debate on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> question in the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>, <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> took occasion, and very gratuitously, to express the hope that the war now raging here would end in the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>It was not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the <rs>Minister</rs> for Foreign Affairs in the <rs>British Cabinet</rs> illustrated his <hi rend="italics">determined neutrality</hi> in the struggle on this continent, by uttering his anti-slavery sentiments in connection with the discussion of that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>In what manner is the abolition wish of this disinterested and philanthropic Minister to be accomplished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It would be an interesting inquiry for some of the opposition members to propound to the magnanimous <rs>Earl</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>He could not expect it to be achieved, save in the over running and subjugation of the <rs>Southern States</rs>; and when he expresses the ardent desire for the <num value="1">one</num>, he inevitably prays for the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>In what other way could the hoped for event come about?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>It may be said that the war may so exhaust both parties, that they may be content to hearken to the remonstrances of Foreign nations, who, as umpire, might settle a peace between them, by a separation of the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs>North</rs>, on the condition of the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Does any man in the <rs>North</rs>, or in the <rs>South</rs>, believe that possible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>No, not <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Whenever the question is propounded, it will be seen, at once, how much sincerity there is in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> protestations that they are fighting to liberate the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The philanthropic professions of the hypocritical <rs>North</rs> are merely designed to enlist <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> sympathies, and to conceal the rapacious and malignant spirit which is at the bottom of the invasion; and the proposition to let us alone, provided we will give up the slaves, would be indignantly repudiated by them.--It is needless to say that it would be as promptly rejected by the <rs>South</rs>, which is determined, as long as it has an arm to lift up to strike its assailant and to defend its rights, <hi rend="italics">that it will submit to dictation from no quarter and from no power on earth.</hi> Our own domestic concerns are to be settled by our own laws, and public opinion within our own boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>We shall never allow intermeddling from beyond those boundaries, and, least of all, shall we hold parley with such hypocritical philanthropists as <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/> This is quite enough to settle the matter, so far as we are concerned, against any possibility of accommodating <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> by means of intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Therefore, there is no mode by which he could be gratified save by our utter subjugation, and that is what we believe he desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>His course on every subject, in which our interests are involved, betrays his real sentiments, not to take into consideration the occasional expression of such a wish as that alluded to in this article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Very naturally his aversion to the <rs>South</rs> drives him to the side of her enemy, to whom he has humbled the <rs>British Lion</rs> on several occasions, until his own countrymen are disgusted with his want of spirit and the disingenuousness with which he essays to explain his truckling and timidity, whenever he is arraigned by <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00381" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> Independent of the right of the <rs>South</rs> to manage her own affairs in her own way; her determination to allow no dictation as long as she has the power of resistance, and the closing of the question of abolition completely on that ground, she is vindicated and justified on every other imaginable ground: moral, civil, and social &mdash; and could not on any of them permit any interference, even though under the guise of friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The Power for whom this philanthropic Minister now manages the foreign relations, established, through the cooperation of the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> on this continent, and established it against the earnest protestations of the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Aye, and they established it under the impulse of that worst of vices, Avarice &mdash; the profits of the trade to the crown and to <name>English</name> traders; and therefore turned a deaf ear to the remonstrances of our ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Being established, and becoming a part of the social and political order in these realms, its extirpation even if desirable, is impossible, without such a convulsion that could not and would no be submitted to. If there is anything wrong in it, however, let the blame rest on the <rs>British Government</rs>, and on that most monstrously hypocritical of all nations, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. --Neither the weal of the negro, nor of the white race of the <rs>South</rs>, could in any wise he promoted by the measure of abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>No better illustration of this need be desired than the fate of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">British West Indies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The impossibility of such a measure &mdash; of changing the relation of the blacks and the whites while they remain in the same land, and of accomplishing the mighty undertaking of their transportation and colonization &mdash; is well understood here, and may be appreciated by any impartial investigator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Well may a distinguished <name>British</name> statesman say that it would take a <num value="1000">thousand</num> Great Eastern to export them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>But it would be the cruelest deed to humanity that ever was perpetrated, to place these blacks on a strange soil to take care of themselves.--Witness the recent futile attempt of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to send a colony of Southern slaves to Hayti.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>They were not suited for the association with Haytiens, who were, to those civilized and humanized blacks, intolerable barbarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Disgusted and dispirited, they returned, even to the frigid and inhospitable shores of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, rather than remain!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>There they were put in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Their story is sad. A <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of their number is said to have perished on the voyage to and fro &mdash; packed, as they were, in a small vessel, and subjected to every discomfort and suffering that a voyage to the tropics, thus confined, could occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>But this is not the time to discuss the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>It will develop itself in due time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The tragic fate of those whom the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have <sic>invelgled</sic> from the <rs>South</rs>, will tell a story, after this war, that the world will never forget. </p>
