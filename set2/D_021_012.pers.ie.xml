<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> --More than any other people in the world, those of the <rs>South</rs> abhor the measures of arbitrary power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Our people are the only true democracy now to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>True, our affairs are not conducted by orders entered in the market place by vote of the people in mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>We have improved upon the system of <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName>, by substituting the principle of representation under the restrictions of a written organic law, for a direct participation of the multitude in public legislation But, by means of this very conduit of representation, the will of the entire people is more perfectly conveyed to, and reflected in the action of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The democratic voice is not expressed tumultuously and in fits of excitement and passion; but our modes of collecting the popular will and giving utterance to the popular voice are so perfect, as to reflect the sentiment of a democracy organized, orderly, and calmed and steadied by conservative checks and balances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Our democracy is also select, intelligent, and educated, by being relieved of the dross of ignorance and mere animal passion, which is effected through the operation of the slave institution, which deprives the class performing the mental and coarser departments of labor of all voice in public affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> If the problem of self government admits of affirmative solution at all, it must surely find it in the experiment that is going on successfully, if not already solved, in our Southern States.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> The fact that the people of the <rs>Northern States</rs> have submitted to the overthrow of all the sacred bulwarks of liberty, and have allowed to military power the exercise of despotic authority in matters the most delicate and in forms the most oppressive, is proof, by tacit confession, that free institutions have proved a failure with themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>By such appeals, and by giving to the foreigners in their midst no chance of living except by enlisting in their army, they have contrived to raise those plundering hordes by who my our so is invaded, and our rights and liberties menaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The Northern army is, in point of fact, a foreign army, led by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers, and they are desecrating a country which was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and army section of the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to protect them from that political ostracism of all foreigners which had its origin in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>If they cannot do this, they do not deserve to be free.--No people ever yet achieved their deliverance, or were worthy of it, who fled from their own country and looked to strangers to rescue them from bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It is enough, we should think, that this virgin continent gives them the means of support for themselves and their families, without calling upon us to surrender rights which have been earned by our strong arms, and to become slaves ourselves in order that the vassals of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> may become freemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> Recent Northern journals bring to us copies of letters written North by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners confined at the <rs>South</rs>, as well as the published statements of those who have been released from confinement and generously permitted to return to Lincolndom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>In every instance that your correspondent has observed, they represent that they are treated badly at the <rs>South</rs>, which, to my own knowledge, is a barefaced falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They are treated <num value="0.2">twenty per cent</num>, better here than are our prisoners North.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>For instance, when <persName n="Rickett,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Rickett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Rickett</surname></persName>'s was released and arrived <name>North</name> he, with his wife, gave an outrageous account of how they were treated while in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, when the fact is generally known that the ladies of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; among the foremost of whom, I believe, was <persName n="Davis,Mrs.,President,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="default:Davis,President,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>President</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>--gave them all the attention and kindness imaginable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> Now, let us see what treatment is bestowed upon those from the <rs>South</rs> who have been so unfortunate as to have fallen into the hands of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>I recollect of an instance which came under my own personal observation, while on a visit to <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>There were about a dozen Confederate prisoners brought to that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They were marched down their principal street, <address><street n="Pennsylvania avenue">Pennsylvania avenue</street></address>, to be shown off to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>While going down the avenue, guarded by a few outlaws, every indignity was permitted to be inflicted on them &mdash; even the negroes were allowed to step in between the guard and slap them in the face, the guard not offering a word of remonstrance for such outrageous conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Such treatment is not permitted South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>They are treated, on the contrary, with too much kindness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> In a speech made a few days ago by <persName n="Ely,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Ely,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ely</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, he said that a young lady of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> made him a present of a beautiful writing desk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If such was the case, under all the circumstances, she must be in some measure related to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation; for I cannot think that a true Southern lady would be guilty of such indelicate conduct, to say the least. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> I am also informed that it is the practice of our Government to allow fernals to go North without being subjected to search.--Now, when a lady leaves <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> to go to any part of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, she is thoroughly searched, her baggage and person, to see whether or not she has any contraband article about her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>They were required to divest themselves of their clothing, all to <num value="1">one</num> garment; the lining of their bonnets and shawls, even, were ripped open in order that nothing <q>&#x0022;contraband,&#x0022;</q> might be carried away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Without finding anything, however, they were permitted to dress themselves and proceed on their journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi> In a recent paper of <date value="11-19">Nov. 19th, </date> an article appeared on the re-organization of our Army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>The views therein expressed coincided with those of the humble individual who now addresses you, for the purpose of submitting to your consideration a paper, which, if unworthy of publication, may, at least, afford amusement, and perchance suggest ideas to some of the able writers whose productions adorn the pages of your most influential journal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> portion, you will perceive, is but a peg, on which to hang an argument; should it be deemed unworthy of the space it would occupy, consign it to the flames; should the latter portion not meet with approval, let the argument follow the peg. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Who is Anon?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> Many of us have been troubled, in our early days, to discover the identity of this gifted writer, whose literary effusions have, from time to time excited our admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>Some of my early associates, it is true, who thought themselves shrewder than the rest, asserted that he had no identity; and that <q>&#x0022;Anon&#x0022;</q> was a <q>&#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">nom de plume,</hi></foreign>&#x0022;</q> used by writers too modest to make themselves known; or who, not being able to fix upon a father, were therefore anonymous, and used the abbreviation <q>&#x0022;Anon&#x0022;</q> in lieu of a less doubtful patronymic. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assertion I summarily disposed of, by triumphantly demonstrating that it was altogether unlikely that all modest writers should have hit on the same <q>&#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"> <hi rend="italics">nom de plume;</hi></foreign>&#x0022;</q> the last I treated as a malicious insinuation, too base for notice, against my favorite author. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/> This morning, while walking through the woods of <placeName reg="Warwick, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2752037">Warwick</placeName>, I met with signal and pleasant proof of the justice of my conclusions as to the individual in question, I had unthinkingly turned off the narrow bridle path that leads to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, when I was suddenly confronted by a man of singular yet venerable aspect, who accosted me with politeness, and in a conversation which ensued, astonished me no less with his vast general information, than with his pleasing variety of style. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> My new acquaintance appeared to become pleased with me as our intercourse progressed; this I perceived, and as I was equally well pleased with him, I produced from my wallet, a bottle of <q>&#x0022;Baumgartner's best,&#x0022;</q> which I always carry with me for medicinal purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> My companion, perceiving this, informed me that although he abhorred liquor, he was compelled to use it in small quantities, for the benefit of his health, and that he would therefore, feel greatly obliged to me for a drink. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> Order the influence of <persName n="Baumgartner,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00501" reg="mostcommon:Baumgartner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Baumgartner</surname></persName>'s great specific, he became quite communicative; and as the treatment progressed, his manner became almost affectionate, while his confidence was so much increased, that after exacting from me a promise, that I would give him <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> start before making known the fact of his presence, he informed me that he was the celebrated <persName n="Anon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00502" reg="mostcommon:Anon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Anon</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/> After I had somewhat recovered from my astonishment, he went on to tell me that, although he had been basely slandered by an ignorant, curious, and unthinking public, his pedigree was as free from stain as his character from reproach; that he was between <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="400years" type="date">four hundred years</measure> old; and that although his long life had been <num value="1">one</num> of untiring industry, such was his natural timidity that he had ever shrunk from being publicly known as an author. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> It would be tedious for me to enumerate all the works of which he assured me that he was the author; but I cannot forbear mentioning the deep feeling with which he spoke of parties who, knowing his distaste for notoriety, had taken to themselves the credit of some of his best works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>He complained bitterly of <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Smith,,Albert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00503" reg="default:Smith,Albert,,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, who had robbed him of the just credit due him for his celebrated <q>&#x0022;Address to a Mummy,&#x0022;</q> and said that the baseness of <persName n="Junius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00504" reg="mostcommon:Junius,nomatch:0"><surname>Junius</surname></persName> in affixing his name to certain letters which he was paid to make public was only exceeded by the treachery of a <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> barrister, with a halting gait, whom he met with in the ruins of <persName n="Abbey,,Melrose,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00505" reg="default:Abbey,Melrose,,,"><foreName>Melrose</foreName> <surname>Abbey</surname></persName>, and who so won upon him by his pleasing address that he confided to him for publication his original manuscripts of the <rs>Waverly Novels</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/> Much as I was pleased with the modesty and apparent worth of my entertainer, and with all my self-gratulation on the soundness of my early views as to his personal identity, I did not forget that it was my bounden duty to satisfy myself as to the correctness of his political views before suffering him to depart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/> In answer to my interrogatories on this subject he informed me that he was a good Southern man, and as such, had written a paper containing facts and suggestions which he hoped would be found worthy of the able and patriotic men to whom are confided the destinies of our beloved country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/> So interested had I become in this conversation that time passed away unnoticed, until my companion, declaring that he must visit a neighboring camp, thrust a manuscript into my hand and took a hasty leave of me, remarking that, should any profit accrue from the publication, I could settle with him at a future time, as he proposed to spend the winter of <dateStruct value="1980--"><year reg="1980">1980</year></dateStruct> in New Orleans, at which time he would be happy to renew our acquaintance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> What passed from the time of his departure until evening I know not; but certain it is, that I awoke from a deep sleep as the sun was about to disappear for the night, and, looking upon the events of the day as some remarkable dream, I was about to return to camp without further thought, when my attention was attracted by a folded manuscript lying by the side of my now empty bottle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/> On my return to camp I opened the manuscript, and found it to read as follows: </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Company Organization of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/> Organized in a few short months, the army of the <rs>South</rs>, is a source of pride to ourselves and of wonder to foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Since <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct> last, <num value="400000">400,000</num> men have taken the field in defence of their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>They have met the enemy at many points, and have signally defeated him in nearly every engagement.--The campaign is now nearly over, and it is hardly likely that any important results will arise from the movements of the contending armies before spring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/> In the meantime, the enemy is adopting energetic measures to improve the discipline and increase the efficiency of their army.--Shall we not do the same?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>I answer yes; and to effect this, let it be our task to lay bare the defects of the volunteer system, and that of our legislators to provide the remedy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/> Nearly all the company officers of our army are men of little military experience, some of them of little education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>They owe their elections in many cases to the fact of their previous popularity in the communities wherein they resided; in others, to the ostentatious display of a small amount of military knowledge before these who had none; while others again, have been elected to fill the places of resigned officers, through a popularity gained among the men by neglecting their duties as officers or non-commissioned officers of the company. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/> Even under these disadvantages, the enthusiasm of the young and gentle blood of the country, has enabled them to bear for a time with the hardships, privations, and laborious military duties, incidental to an active campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/> This cannot long continue, for many of these men have now learned enough of military matters to unfold to them the utter incompetency of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>They have discovered, too, that their officers, although nominally in command, are in many respects their servants; for, say they, if that <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">First Lieutenant</rs> punishes me for my faults or crimes, or falls to screen me from the consequences of them, he shall never get my vote for captain and so down to the <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> Corporal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The least efficient is the most pension. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/> Then being the case, the men are not <unclear></unclear> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/> control, whether in camp or on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Men on a reconnaissance, after waiting an hour or so, and seeing no enemy, have been known to disperse through the country in search of provisions, or to return to camp in such numbers as to diminish the force by nearly <num value="0.5">one-half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>There is scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of them but will acknowledge the evils, nay the danger, of this and similar misconduct; yet such is, and ever will be, the shortsightedness of young men, that they will in <measure n="9cases" type="mass">nine cases</measure> out of <num value="10">ten</num> favor the lenient body who, without knowledge to impart, has not energy sufficient to keep his men together, or repress marauding. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> In some divisions of the army, few of the company officers understand the principles of the school of the soldier; few of the companies have been instructed in skirmishing drill, and still fewer in bayonet exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The importance of these matters is plain to all intelligent officers; yet, strange to say, except in rare cases, they make no effort to acquire themselves, or to impart to their men the knowledge sufficient to inspire them with confidence in themselves, or to induce them with the belief that they will be well handled on the field of battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/> Under these circumstances, is it to be wondered at that men feel the degradation of serving under officers whose incapacity is rivalled by the ever-lowering tone or <q>&#x0022;morale&#x0022;</q> of the men? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/> I would, therefore, respectfully suggest that Congress devise some means of removing incompetent officers, and of rewarding those who, move by an exalted patriotism, strive to perform the whole duty of a soldier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/> What may be the fate of this paper I know not, nor whether praise or censure may be awarded to its author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>I care little, provided the effect be beneficial, firmly believing that my duty to my country can be best discharged by speaking thus plainly, and trusting that the wisdom of our legislators may enable us to take the field next spring in greater strength and efficiency than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> It may be urged, with some show of truth, that the language of my sylvan acquaintance is too severe; but it should be remembered that he speaks not of individuals, but in condemnation of a system. </p>
