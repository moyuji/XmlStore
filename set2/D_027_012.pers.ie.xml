<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>This shell was fired from our <num value="100">hundred</num>- pound forward rifle pivot, and would certainly have penetrated the chain and entirely disabled the <rs>Kearsarge</rs> had our powder been good, as this gun would have carried the shell and taken effect at <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> with dry powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Our powder had been a long time on board, and was dampened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>They soon became wicked and deceitful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Instead of contenting themselves with what had been given to them, they took possession of as much ground as they liked, and when they were rich they would not any longer pay the oatmeal they had agreed for. Every year when we went to ask for it they overwhelmed us with abuse and maledictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>And they stole all the goats and sheep that wandered away from our flocks into the hollows among the mountains.&#x0022;--This combination of hypocrisy and villainy, of abjectness in poverty, and insolence and injustice in prosperity, is as essentially <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> as <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>They do not put a pistol to your head and cry roughly, &#x0022;Your money or your life!&#x0022; but they say in the most courteous tones, &#x0022;My eldest brother, I am weary of walking on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>They unsaddle their cattle, prepare tea, render them a <num value="1000">thousand</num> small services; caress, flatter, and, as it were, magnetize them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The Tartars, free from duplicity themselves, and never suspecting it in others, are generally completely duped by all this apparent kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Aware, besides, of their own want of address in business, they are enchanted to find friends who will transact it for them; a good dinner gratis given them in the back shop is sure to convince them of the good faith of their <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>At this dinner, all the corruption and dishonesty of the <name>Chinese</name> come into full play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>These goods are generally sold at double and often triple the current prices; yet they have the internal talent of persuading the unhappy <rs>Tartar</rs> that he is making an excellent bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Thus, when the victim returns to the &#x0027;Land of Grass&#x0027; he is full of abuses about the irresistible generosity of the <name>Chinese</name>.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The traveller said he was from a great commercial house in <placeName reg="Beijing, Beijing Shi, Zhonghua" key="tgn,7001758">Pekin</placeName>, and had been sent to collect debts from the <name>Tartars</name>. &#x0022;You, I suppose,&#x0022; said he, addressing <persName n="Huc,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="default:Huc,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Huc</surname></persName> and his companions, &#x0022;are, like me, <hi rend="italics">eaters of Tartars.</hi> &#x0022; &#x0022;Eaters of Tartars!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>What is the meaning of that?&#x0022;--&#x0022;Ah, we eat them by traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>They are simple &mdash; why should we not profit by them to get a little money?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>For my part, if it was not for money, I would never set foot in Tartary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>We merchants, we do, to be sure, gnaw them to the bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>We give them goods on credit, and then of course they must pay rather high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>When people take away goods without leaving the money, of course there must be a little interest of <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="0.4">forty per cent.</num> Then, by degrees, the interest mounts up, and you come to compound interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>A Tartar debt is never paid &mdash; It goes on from generation to generation; every year <num value="1">one</num> goes to get the interest, and it's paid in sheep, oxen, camels, horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>All that is a great deal better than money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>We get the beasts at a low price, and we sell them at a very good price in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Oh! it's a capital thing &mdash; a Tartar debt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It's a mine of gold.&#x0022; If the <name>Tartars</name>, after being fleeced for generations in this way, should &#x0022;secede,&#x0022; would it not be &#x0022;the most wicked rebellion under the sun,&#x0022; except that in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/> The <rs>Chinese</rs> do not know the name of hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>In Tartary, every door stands open to the stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>After their fashion, the <name>Tartars</name> are honestly religious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The <rs>Chinese</rs> are not sincere in their own idolatry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>They are cold, sneering, and sceptical of all religious; yet the most bitter persecutors of Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>In licentiousness, they surpass all belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Nothing approaching them in the iniquity of uncleanliness can be found, except in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>An immense caravan which he accompanied to Thibet was escorted by <num value="300">three hundred</num> <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> soldiers and <num value="200">two hundred</num> brave Tartars. &#x0022;The <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> soldiers,&#x0022; says he, &#x0022;acquitted themselves of their duty like true <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>For fear of any disagreeable reencounter, they kept themselves prudently at the rear of the caravan, and there sung, smoked, and amused themselves, quite at their case, without disturbing themselves at all about the brigands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>They could also pick up many stray articles which had been unintentionally left behind at the different encampments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Very different was the behavior of the <name>Tartars</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>They might be seen continually galloping in advance, and at the flanks of the caravan &mdash; up the bills, and down into the deepest ravines, to see if there were any robbers lying in embossed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/> The parallel might be continued in other <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> particulars, but our limits forbid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The supple submission of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind to all the behests of power is only equalled by the abjectness of the <name>Chinese</name> to their imperial master.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> &#x0022;But suppose you were to say that an object cannot be <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> at the same time? &#x0022; </p>
