<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> In the message addressed to you on the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="29">29th inst.</day></dateStruct>, I referred to the course of conduct of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> towards the <rs>Commissioners</rs> of this Government, sent to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for the purpose of effecting, if possible, a peaceful adjustment of the pending difficulties between the <num value="2">two</num> Governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I also made allusion to <q>&#x0022;an intermediary, whose high position and character inspired the hope of success,&#x0022;</q> but I was not then at liberty to make any communication on this subject, as specific as was desirable for a full comprehension of the whole subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is now, however, in my power to place before you other papers which I herewith address to you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is due to you, to him, and to history, that a narration of the occurrences with which he was connected should be made known, the more especially as it will be seen by the letters hereto appended that the correctness and accuracy of the recital have not been questioned by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to whom it was addressed. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> There was a departure here from the pledges of the previous month, but with the verbal explanation I did not consider it a matter then to complain of. I simply stated to you that I had that assurance previously. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> On the <date value="04-07">7th April,</date> I addressed you a letter on the subject of the alarm that the preparations by the <rs>Government</rs> had created, and asked you if the assurances I had given were well or ill-founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I told him I might, perhaps, be of some service in arranging the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>I came to your office entirely at his request, and without the knowledge of either of the <rs>Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> Indignation at the attack on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> seems to be the prevailing feeling throughout the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Mankind will always be more moved by the sound of actual warfare than by the violation of rights or the abandonment of compacts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The Southern States may have torn the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs> to pieces, but the patience of the <rs>North</rs> was not worn out until shot and shell had been poured into a Federal Fortress and a Federal officer had been led a prisoner through the rebellious city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Now, however, there can be no doubt of the excitement all through the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>How long it may last, and whether it will survive a calm examination of the coming campaign, are other questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>For the present, there is an earnest desire in the <rs>Northern States</rs> to avenge the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s appeal has been responded to in every quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The feeling in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> was so strong at the departure of the last steamer, that the <rs>Herald</rs>, which has been throughout these troubles practically a Southern print, was forced to turn completely round and applaud the policy of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States and those of the <rs>West</rs> were also said to be zealous in the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Troops were being mustered in the leading towns and made ready to march for the defence of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, it not for the invasion of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>This outburst of loyalty may be attributed not a little to the restless character of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Year after year the military ardor of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> has been expended on militia field-days, on processions, <date value="07-04">Fourth of July</date> demonstrations, and other proceedings equally showy and harmless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>But something more has been demanded by the hot blood of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>They leaped into the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> as if it were a relief from an intolerable tedium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It has required considerable judgment and forbearance to prevent a collision with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> on several senseless disputes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Now, however, there is employment for every unquiet spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The Southerners have within a few hours come to be looked upon as enemies, against whom a crusade is meritorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Even in New York, which has been called with some justice a Southern city, where the productions of the <rs>South</rs> are dealt in more than in the <rs>Southern</rs> cities themselves, where the slave traders are said to congregate, and where the party of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was small and weak a few months back, all traditions, all interests, all political feelings are now forgotten, and the whole community demands that justice should be done on the traitors of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> If wishes were weapons, if the trumpet blast of Northern defiance could throw down the walls of every Southern fort, then the campaign would, no doubt, be short enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>But this enthusiasm of the <rs>North</rs> only leads us to believe that a fierce and lasting struggle may possibly be begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The States faithful to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> have now accepted the doctrine that secession is treason, and that the seceding States may legitimately be conquered and held by the victors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>But the intelligence which reaches us from the <rs>South</rs> seems to show that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are equally determined on maintaining their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The ardor of New York, or even <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, cannot be greater than that of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The Southerners, indeed, may be expected to be even more resolute than their opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>They know very well that there is now between them and the <rs>North</rs> a gulf which time and quiet may fill up, but which the shock of war will widen until it is impassible forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>They know what the <name>Northerners</name> seem not sufficiently to consider &mdash; that the recapture of the <rs>Federal</rs> forts is nothing in itself, but merely symbolizes the subjection of the recusant States to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> <num value="1">One</num> may well ask the <name>Northerners</name> what they intend to do when they have recaptured <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and what next, and next?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The Southerners know full well that the <rs>Central Government</rs> cannot be content with the <q>&#x0022;retaining the <rs>Federal</rs> property,&#x0022;</q> and that as long as they, the <name>Secessionists</name>, refuse to acknowledge <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, acts of hostility must take place between the <num value="2">two</num> sections &mdash; the <rs>Southern</rs> ports must be blockaded, and the <rs>Southern States</rs> subject to the inroads of Northern, and even of Abolitionist bands.--Therefore, though we have not such detailed accounts from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, yet, from what we are able to publish to-day, it is easy to see that the enthusiasm in the <rs>North</rs> was more than equalled by the zeal of the <name>Southerners</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Indeed, as is generally the case, the weaker party actually appears in greater strength than its opponents, since a knowledge of its inferiority leads to efforts and sacrifices which more than make up for its deficiencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The Southerners show certainly no signs of wavering, and it will be cherishing a delusive hope to imagine that either through fear of the <rs>Federal</rs> arms, or from deference to the majority of their fellow-citizens, the seceders will be inclined to compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>We fear that, should the <rs>North</rs> determine to enforce obedience, we must be prepared for conflicts of the most serious kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Southern news does not reach us very regularly, or speedily, or accurately, but the present telegraphic dispatches announce that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Proclamation had been met by defiance, as general as the enthusiasm of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Something like a levy in mass may be expected among the population of the <rs>South</rs>, who are easily made into soldiers, and who, from the skill with the rifle, must always be formidable antagonists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/><persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, who fought at the head of the <orgName n="Mississippi volunteers" type="volunteers">Mississippi volunteers</orgName> in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, will probably take the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>He was, we believe, originally educated for the army, though he subsequently abandoned the military calling for law and politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The points at which attacks might be made by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> were being strongly reinforced, and the experience of recent warfare leads us to believe that a determined force behind military works will be dangerous enemies to a disembarking or advancing army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>As to the financial position of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, we learn that the whole loan of <measure n="16000000dollars" type="currency">$16,000,000</measure> has been taken at par at New Orleans, where military ardor was very high.--In fact, as far as can be judged from the somewhat scanty intelligence received, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were preparing to defend themselves to the last, declaring that their right to secede from the <rs>Union</rs> is as clear as the right of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies to throw off allegiance to <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.; and more so, since the <rs>British Government</rs> only violated a traditional maxim respecting taxation, while the <rs>North</rs>, according to them, has violated a written Constitution by endeavoring to restrict the right of holding persons to labor throughout the entire Union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> But it is useless to speculate further on matters which will be made clear in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The most momentous part of the present news is undoubtedly that which relates to the <rs>Border States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>It is just possible that some of these will not immediately secede; but the secession of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was expected to take place in a few days, and it is probable that already this grave act has been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Should this be the case, the others must eventually follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Though there is a large non-slaveholding element both in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, yet the owners form the most powerful class, and the passions of the multitude have been everywhere roused against <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as an assailant of the rights of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Without giving implicit credit to all that is reported by telegraph, there is evidence enough to show that a large body of the people in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> will take up arms in defence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. <persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pillow</surname></persName> had arrived at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> to offer <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> a division of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The martial excitement once begun will certainly spread, seize all minds, and at no distant date carry these States out of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> Had the <rs>Border States</rs>, however, even remained firm, it would have been a difficult task for <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to carry on such a war as he meditates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>A march from the <rs>North</rs> through the <name>States</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> seems an enterprise beyond the powers of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The country would be almost that of an enemy, for the sympathies of the slave-owners would be everywhere with their Southern friends.--It is difficult to conceive that this project has ever been entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>We must believe that expeditions by sea are the means by which the <rs>President</rs> intends to bring the rebels to obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Now, operations of this kind are not only very difficult in the face of a strong and resolute enemy, but they <unclear>e</unclear> time in preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Whatever may be the result when the <rs>Federal</rs> militia attempt to land at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, or to repeat the <rs>British</rs> enterprise against New Orleans, we must at least expect that transport and commissariat will occupy a month or <num value="2">two</num>, and that, with the whole Southern population in arms, it will not be thought prudent to send small or ill-equipped expeditions against the leading cities of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Although, certainly, numbers, wealth and a sufficient zeal are on the side of the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs>, yet the damages of an offensive war are so great that <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> may even now well hesitate to begin it. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> The wealth and prosperity of the <rs>North</rs> are not to be denied; but it is dependent and not self-sustaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The manufactures of the <rs>North</rs> can flourish only while they have ample markets open for their goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>If these markets are closed, the manufactures cease to flourish and to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Then the very labor which before was wealth and power, becomes a charge and a burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>So with her shipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>No people in the world were so wealthy as the <rs>North</rs> in ships and sailors; but, deprive these of the trade upon which they subsisted, and you convert their seamen into vagrants their marine into a dead and rotting investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The like is the case with all the machinery, equipments and outfit of commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The fine buildings of the cities, the army of clerks, the merchant princes, the great cities themselves, all lose their occupation, and become a charge and burden to the country, consumers of food and no longer producers of wealth, on the cessation of business. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> No wealth and no prosperity is really intrinsic and independent except that of an agricultural people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They can stand blockades and the stoppage of trade; but the manufacturers cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They can cease to buy and sell and yet continue to live; but merchants and book-keepers and bankers cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>They can subsist in comfort, though not a pound of freight passes from port to port; but a community of ship-owners and sailors can not. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> The <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00280" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> Government is inaugurating precisely the policy which must ruin the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>To stop the <rs>Southern</rs> trade is to paralyze the <rs>North</rs>, which almost monopolized these markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>To stop up the <rs>Southern</rs> ports is to destroy the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> coasting trade, which created and sustained the <rs>Northern</rs> merchant marine, the largest and best in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>To prevent the <rs>South</rs> from buying merchandize from the <rs>North</rs> is to confer a substantial benefit upon her, while depriving the <rs>North</rs> of her largest and most profitable customer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Instead of raising barriers against commercial intercourse, the clear policy of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00281" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> would be to remove and keep down all barriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>If he did not undertake the work for us, the <rs>South</rs>, in self-defence, would have herself to interdict trade with the <rs>North</rs>, and encounter great expense and odium in enforcing the non-intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>But for his proclamation of blockade, we should have to proclaim an embargo against all trade with the <rs>North</rs>, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> True, he may cut off the <rs>Southern</rs> trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; but the <rs>South</rs> would not gain more from this commerce than the <rs>North</rs> would gain by such trade as, but for <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00282" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> policy, it could contrive to keep open with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Nor will the odium which the <rs>North</rs> will incur in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from the blockade be less injurious to itself than an interdiction of Southern trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will be to us. The embargo established at <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> seems especially injurious to the interests of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It prevents Western produce venders from sending their provision stuffs to market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>It prevents Northern manufactures from procuring cotton for their mills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The loss by the <rs>South</rs> of the sums it might obtain from that direction is most inconsiderable, compared with the loss which the <rs>Western</rs> produce growers and Northern manufacturers must sustain by thus blocking up of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The right hand of the <rs>North</rs> seems in these things to have forgot its cunning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>In the desperation of its anger, the fangs of that section seem to have been turned upon itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> The true policy of the <rs>North</rs> would seem to us to have been the very opposite on to that they are pursuing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>They should have disdained to attack commerce, to stifle business, which are the breaths of Northern life; they should have eschewed the thought of blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The manly course was the true <num value="1">one</num> for them to pursue &mdash; that of naked coercion-- plain, downright hard fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>They were the commercial, they the shipping, they the trading section; and in attacking these interests, the <rs>Washington Administration</rs> have attacked the vitals of Northern prosperity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> The blockade and its kindred measures will be a great advantage to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It will set on foot a <num value="1000">thousand</num> branches of manufacture which would never have taken spontaneous root in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>How very many classes of manufacture there are connected with the equipment of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Half the wants of domestic life are supplied by the same factories which provide the outfit of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>If we are made to manufacture all the articles requisite in war within ourselves, we shall continue to manufacture them when the war shall have ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>All that we ever wanted for the establishment of these manufactures in the <rs>South</rs>, was a prohibition of the <rs>Northern</rs> rival article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>No sooner is that prohibition decreed by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00284" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>,</hi> than the new manufacture springs up spontaneously around us.

<head>Tall holt better than no holt.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> The following laughable affair is from a book entitled <placeName reg="Fisher's River">Fisher's River</placeName> Scenes and Characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>The incident is located in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>It is the story of a man named <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Stanley,,Oliver,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00529" reg="default:Stanley,Oliver,,,"><foreName>Oliver</foreName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> who was taken captive by wild <q>&#x0022;Injuns,&#x0022;</q> After some consideration, they put him into an empty oil barrel and headed him up, leaving the bung hole open that he might be longer dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The prisoner relates a portion of his experience in this wise: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> I determined to get out'n that or bust a trace; and so I pounded away with my fist till; I beat it into nearly a jelly, at the end of the bar'l but it were no go. Then I butted a spell with my noggin, but I had no purchase like old rams when they butt; fur, you know, they back ever so far when they make a tilt.--So I caved in, made my last will and testament, and virtually gave up the ghost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>It war a mighty serious time with me, to be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>While I were lying there, balancing accounts with t'other world, and afore I had all my figgers made out to see how things 'nd stand, I heard suthin' scrambulating in the leaves, and snortin' every whipstitch like he smelt suthin' he didn't <sic>aczactly</sic> like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>I lay as still as a salamander, and thought, maybe there's chance fur <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00530" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Oliver,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> yit. So the critter, whatever it mout be, kep' moseyin round the bar'l. Last he came to the bunghole, put his nose in, smelt mighty perticuler, and gin a monstrous loud short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>I holt what little breath I had to keep the critter from smellin' the intarnals ov that bar'l. I soon seen it was a bar of the woods &mdash; the big king bar of the woods, who had lived thar from time immortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Thinks I, old fellow look out; old <persName n="Oliver,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00531" reg="mostcommon:Oliver,nomatch:0"><surname>Oliver</surname></persName> ain't dead yit. Jist then, he put his black paw in jist as fur as he could, and scrabbled about to make 'scovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tho't I had was to nab his paw, as a drowndin' max will ketch at a straw; but I soon seen that wouldn't do, for you see he couldn't then travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>So I jist waited a spell with great flatterbation of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>The next move he made was to put his tall in at the bunghole ov the bar'l to test inards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>I seen that were my time to mark my <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00532" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>; so I seized my holt, and shouted at the top ov my voice: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> <q>&#x0022;Charge, <persName n="Chester,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00533" reg="mostcommon:Chester,nomatch:0"><surname>Chester</surname></persName>, charge!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>On, <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00534" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Oliver,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, on!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/> And the bar he put, and I knowed tall holt were better than no holt; and so we went, bar'l and all, the bar full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Now, my hope were that the bar would <hi rend="italics">jump over some pressepiss,</hi> break the bar'l all to shiverations, and liberate me from my nasty, stinkin', <unclear>ily </unclear> prison, and sure 'nuff, the bar at full speed leaped over a caterack <hi rend="italics"><num value="50">fifty</num> foot high.</hi> Down we went together in a pile, codswallop, on a big rock, bustin' the bar'l and nearly shakin' my gizzard out' me. I let go my tall-holt-- had no more use for it &mdash; and away went the bar like a whirly gust ov woodpeckers were after it. I've never seen nor heard from that bar since, but he has my best wishes for his present and future welfare. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
