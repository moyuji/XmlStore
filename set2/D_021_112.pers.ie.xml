<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The all-absorbing theme of conversation now is the threatened occupation of New Orleans by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>As yet we have no authentic advices from there, upon which we can construct a historic narrative of events; but enough is known to satisfy us that the great metropolis of the <rs>South</rs> has nobly done her duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><num value="13">Thirteen</num> gunboats are at her door, and backed by their thunder, the <rs>Federal Commodore</rs> has made a demand for surrender, which the brave-hearted <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> has refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>To use his own language, almost <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> in its simplicity, <q>&#x0022;As to hoisting any other flag than that of our adoption and allegiance, let me say to you, sir, that the man lives not in our midst whose hand and heart would not be palsied at the mere though of such an act; nor could I find in my entire constituency so wretched and desperate a renegade as would dares to profane with his hands the sacred emblem of our aspirations.&#x0022;</q> He says further, and with a <hi rend="italics">naivete</hi> that cannot but cause a smile, that he don't <q>&#x0022;know how to surrender,&#x0022;</q> and his people will <q>&#x0022;yield simply the obedience which the conqueror is enabled to extort from the conquered.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The tone and sentiment pervading the entire epistle is refreshingly patriotic, stirring to the heart, and while it will excite abroad, as it does here, the admiration of all men, for the dauntless courage exhibited in the face of an overwhelming danger, it will teach to the vandal foe that they have to do with worthy descendants of the sires who pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honors, to the cause of their country's independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Another scene was enacted in the great drama, for which modern history has few parallels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Men, women and children turned out of their houses <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> to aid in the destruction of the property liable to capture &mdash; Gentlemen were seen rolling huge hogsheads of sugar into the levees, until they numbered <measure n="1000casks" type="mass">thousands casks</measure> of molasses were knocked in end, and the contents maneuvered sweetly through the gutters, in streams ankle deep.--The torch was applied to <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName>, and when night came there flashed up against the dark sky voiceless tongues of fire from <measure n="30000barrels" type="mass">30,000 bales</measure> proudly proclaiming to the conqueror the spirit of resistance, sacrifice, invincibility, and defiance which characterize this people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Citizens gathered in sullen knots upon the levees and around the public buildings to unite their common determination never to surrender; the ladies and children clustered in crowds upon the thoroughfares, waving Confederate flags and eliciting the cheers of the populace, while the more excitable of the community, constituting the lower classes, could hardly be re-trained from laying violent hands upon the minions of Lincolndom who were landed to do the <rs>Federal</rs> bidding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The stars and stripes were out down and trampled in the dust almost as soon as they floated in the air, and our own Confederate ensign ran defiantly up from a <num value="100">hundred</num> mastheads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It was a re-inaction of the old time honored fervid scenes of the <name>Revolution</name>, and the pulses that beat in those strong hearts beat in unison to a sentiment that breathed of <q> &#x0022;liberty or death.&#x0022;</q> Thus stood the attitude of affairs at our last advices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He not only deprecated the angry spirit and abusive language in which it was customary with <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> to speak of us and our institutions, but he went a step further, and declared, with a candor and boldness almost unexampled in such assemblies, that we did not deserve such treatment, inasmuch as in any international differences we for the most part had been clearly in the right and <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> in the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He said that in the <rs>Trent</rs> affair we were proved to be in the right by the concurrent decisions of all <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Governments, including those most cordially disposed toward <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Of our attitude during the civil war, he observed that it was certainly as friendly as that of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, to which no exception was taken, while of our general policy he spoke in terms of unreserved commendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He remarked that in all recent treaties we had permitted <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> to gain the advantage that we had overlooked in the <rs type="place">San Juan</rs> affair a piece of conduct on the part of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> which they, if the decision had been theirs, would probably have resented by instant war; that we had endured their protective and injurious traffic without retaliating; and that in all such matters we had shown a superior and enlightened liberality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>For all these reasons, he thought it inexpedient to express any distrust of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, or to encourage any ideas of hostility or war by the erection of the defences proposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> It will be thought on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> that the speech we have thus summarized was but a moderate and impartial exposition of the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Such, indeed, is the fact; but it is a very remarkable speech, never the lets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><measure n="3months" type="date">Three months</measure> ago it could, perhaps, hardly have been delivered or published with safety, and when we find that on the present occasion it was listened to, if not with assent, at any rate with patience and attention, we are justified in concluding that the tide of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> opinion on this subject must be upon the turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>We are confident enough that as passion passes a way and reason prevails the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> will see that they have no reason to complain of us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>But of anything like evil purpose to them at this crisis of their national destinies we are certainly innocent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The war was none of our making, nor connected in any way with our policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We could not beat <num value="9000000">nine millions</num> of <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> as rebels and pirates; but we did not recognize them as an independent nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The practical operation of our neutrality has, of the <num value="2">two</num>, been rather favorable to the <rs>Federals</rs> than otherwise, and the disappointments of the <rs>South</rs>, in this respect, have certainly been more serious than those of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>If we have concluded that the partition of the <rs>Union</rs> had better be accepted, it is because we cannot see our way to any better end. If the <rs>South</rs> resolutely persists in its assertion of independence, we do not see how the <rs>North</rs> can conquer it; nor, if the conquest could be effected, do we see how it could be maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It would be better for <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> if they could have maintained the <rs>Union</rs>; but as they could not do so, and as in falling to do so they have done no worse than other nations before them, we thought it better that they should part with as little harm as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The actual course of the war, up to this time, has proved the correctness of our views, and we have little expectation of any decisive evidence to the contrary in the events to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Groups of children were playing about the corners, but very few adult whites to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>These few were gathered in silent and uncommunicative groups, sullenly smoking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They reminded me very much of the old <rs>Dutchmen</rs> of whom the quaint <rs>Knickerbocker</rs> makes mention in his veracious history of New York, who, when the city was threatened with invasion, collected on the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, with pipes in mouth, and sent up such clouds of smoke that the enemy's fleet ran ashore in the fog. Our business was to search the town for straggling soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> A faint suspicion is dawning on my mind that we are conducting their war a little too gingerly that fewer rose leaves and more round shot should be distributed in the door-yards of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>When disloyalty brings no penalty with it, many indulge in it merely to gratify their love of novelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>It is very pleasant for a man to profess his readiness to encounter martyrdom when he knows very well there is no prospect of his being martyred &mdash; he thus obtains the reputation of a hero at a very cheap rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Thus the gentleman who was within our lines to day, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assured himself that his property would not be disturbed and that he would be protected from pillage, then proffered his readiness to sacrifice every dollar of it to further the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>It is a pity that his desire for a pecuniary crucifixion for opinion's sake could not have been gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>I am tired of seeing these old rascals, their heads hoary with the frosts of rebellious years, stalking round, talking treason, and yet at the same time demanding and obtaining protection for their lares and pennies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> Why, I have been credibly informed that after our little affair here the other evening our wounded soldiers lay out for hours on the ground, unsheltered, because, forsooth, we could not offend the fine sensibilities of the inhabitants by carrying wounded soldiers into their houses in opposition to their wisher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>At the <rs>North</rs> the most comfortable quarters in the neighborhood would have been pressed into service as hospitals for our wounded; do these ungloved rebels who fought behind the barricades on that night, and then donned citizens' dress, deserve to have any more consideration extended them than would be shown loyal citizens under similar circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>At this very moment Union men are fleeing into our lines from the other side of the river, leaving their property behind them, to avoid being pressed into the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Yesterday, of <num value="8">eight</num> brothers named <persName n="Morrison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Morrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Morrison</surname></persName>, <num value="3">three</num> came in &mdash; the other <num value="5">five</num> have been forced South--to ask protection, and suggest that some prominent rebels of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, whom they volunteered to point out, should be arrested and held as hostages for their brothers' return.--A company of men is to be sent over this evening to patrol the town, I believe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> Heretofore <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> has not been occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Though the rebels had large quantities of flour, grain and other stores secreted there, no action was taken to secure them and night after night they have been carried away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Had we placed a few pieces of cannon up on the heights commanding the town, and sent over a flag of truce to bring back the <rs>Mayor</rs> and <orgName n="Common Council" type="council">Common Council</orgName>, then informing these gentlemen that if a single thing was removed an experiment would be made upon the city with shell, I fancy that nothing would have been disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We might also have informed them that for every Union man pressed into the rebel service we would force <num value="10">ten</num> Secession sympathizers into our army, and place them in the front ranks, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engagement; that for every Union man's farm laid waste we would destroy the property of a dozen rebels I fancy that a different condition of things would have been inaugurated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>But this would be establishing a reign of terror, says <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Establishing a reign of terror!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Great <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>it already exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>When Union men are obliged to flee from their homes and secrete themselves in the woods for their lives the reign of terror cannot much further go, and common sense suggests that here it should be ended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> <num value="1">One</num> thing is certain: we must either make war or make peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>It is impossible to have both these luxuries at once &mdash; to fight and shake hands at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>We must either treat these people as enemies or friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Until they avow themselves loyal, would it not be well to make them feel the pains and penalties of disloyalty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>As it is, they declare that they never can be conquered; that they never will be subjugated; that they'll die, and the devil and <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> only knows what not, before they will yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The simple fact is, they don't know what they are talking about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>They haven't tried dying, and don't know what a dreadfully unpleasant thing it is to do; they haven't yet lost their property, and don't know how inconvenient it is for a man to find himself suddenly without money; they take pleasure in proclaiming themselves traitors, because they have not yet become roused to the fact that treason is punishable by death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>They have not yet felt the closing of the iron hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>When the pressure is really felt, and the bones begin to crack, it is my firm belief that they'll be ready to be folded in by the old Union instead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> <num value="2">Two</num> church bells have been shipped from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to be cast into cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>They might have been put to a better use in ringing the knell of a few arch rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Confederate strip is at par in the town, but Treasury notes are scouted as weak in vanillins of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Fact similes of Confederate scrip, printed in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, have been passed off to quite an amount by some of our own soldiers in exchange for other portable property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The natives toll us that no money but of this description has circulated there for months. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> You have already learned by telegraph &mdash; unless the information was contraband &mdash; that some gunboats a fleet of canal boats for bridging purposes, and a ferry boat, have arrived here from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The ferry boat, of course, had to be supplied with coal, and a good joke was played on the <rs>Mayor</rs> by <persName n="Robinson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Robinson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName>, who seized all the coal at the <orgName n="Gas Works" type="works">gas works</orgName> for the purpose; thus shutting off light from the dwellings and the countenances of the natives &mdash; at a time, too, when the town was destitute of candles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The <rs>Mayor</rs> remonstrated, but our peremptory Quartermaster demonstrated very clearly that we ourselves were short of candles, and that their condition would be no worse than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>This is practical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The idea of standing out in the cold ourselves that our enemies may have shelter, is being rapidly <q> &#x0022;played out.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> I think it very probable that we shall have a battle in this vicinity very soon after crossing the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Rebel cavalry were seen to day within <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName></placeName>, and I have it from a very authentic source &mdash; in fact, by several confirmatory stories coming from different sources, that the enemy have a force of from <num value="10000">10,000</num> to <num value="15000">15,000</num> men within <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Great apprehension is entertained of a dash into <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> by the rebel cavalry to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The company of which I made mention in a former part of this letter has not been thrown over, for the reason that the bridge is not yet built, and we would have no means of supporting them should the enemy swoop down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>At the same time our General is excessively adverse to leaving the <rs>Union</rs> men of this burg unprotected, more especially as it is learned the rebels will seize the present opportunity to descend and carry off the few Union men that remain. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The sudden advent of the returning army, and the wild and exaggerated reports which many of the retreating soldiers and officers brought, caused the utmost consternation and excitement among all classes of our citizens, and the removal of the sick soldiers and the rushing off of the rolling stock of the railroad only added, as it were, &#x0022;fuel to the flame.&#x0022; </p>

<head>The Situation &mdash; our duty.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The circumstances surrounding us, their nature and extent, must be patent to all, and needs no reiteration at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>With a large and powerful <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> before our city, demanding its surrender, the reply of our city authorities, dignifiedly and determinedly refusing to accede to the demand &mdash; these and all other things connected with our unpleasant and humiliating condition, are familiar to our readers, and prudence requires that little be said thereof in these columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But, little as we shall say, we will utter in calm, determined, sober and unmistakable language. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> While we counsel order and discretion with our citizens &mdash; that no act be committed tending to insult or to exasperate the enemy in our front &mdash; yet our people should quietly await, with unflinching spirits, the time when the free, unfettered soul, may send forth its natural and patriotic impulses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Let that day be near or far off, it is not of our knowledge at this time to say; but the hope and belief is strong within us that their triumph, yet incomplete, will be of short duration, and this city soon again breathe the pure air of the free. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> It is with feelings of the deepest pride that we point the <rs>Federal</rs> officers to the fact that no Union sentiment exists in our midst &mdash; that with almost <num value="1">one</num> voice and <num value="1">one</num> tongue, this community entirely repudiates all allegiance to the old Government, and warmly and devotedly adheres to the new. And we respectfully but firmly assert that this sentiment, this feeling, is so firmly implanted in the breasts of our people, that no time, no circumstance, no change can serve to eradicate it or still their free souls in the struggle for their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>They have suffered, they may suffered unspeakably in the future, but we hazard nothing in saying that no sacrifice, even to the last life will be toe much to accomplish the <num value="1">one</num> groom mighty and glorious undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>This we honestly believe, and while we do not utter our convictions in a vain-glorious spirit, we will not shrink from their free and independent expression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The action of our city authorities &mdash; the <rs>Mayor</rs> and <orgName n="Common Council" type="council">Common Council</orgName>--has been such as to fill every patriotic breast with honest pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The answer of the <rs>Mayor</rs> to the demand of the <rs>Federal</rs> commander, is at once able, courteous and dignified, and will reflect imperishable honor in the annals of historic time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The Council has fully justified the expectations of the people, and for weal or for woe, their conduct in this trying crisis will be upheld and maintained by every being who can assert the soul of man. We may be <q>&#x0022;conquered, not subdued&#x0022;</q> We may be defenseless, but the craven heart must not be found amongst us who would ingloriously yield obedience to an unjust demand Our powerful enemy may <q>&#x0022;cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war,&#x0022;</q> and a generous, brave, devoted people suffer the horrors thereof, and the innocent welter in their gore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>No ! We will do our enemy the justice to believe them incapable of such an atrocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The distance of the gunboats from the fort is from <num value="3.5">three and a half</num> to <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>, estimating the time between the flash of their guns and the bursting of their shells-say, about <measure n="15seconds" type="date">fifteen seconds</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>The fact that a number of officers who were defeated in the late reorganization of the army have already expressed a desire to join me in this wild, adventurous service, in which individual prowess is not swallowed up in the mere mechanism of great masses of men, induces me to express the hope that many others will do likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>So far as my personal knowledge goes, a large majority of the old volunteer officers who were defeated in the late elections were amongst the very best in our army &mdash; brave and true men and patriots, whose strict fidelity in the discharge of duty, and refusal to electioneer, caused their defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>I don't propose to rely much on military science, but mainly on great celerity of movement, sleepless vigilance, good marksmanship and plenty of old-fashioned rough fighting and bushwhacking, to make the country too hot to permit a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> to show his head outside of his camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>The people would come in there and say all sorts of things to us and about us, until I was obliged to tell them that I was a prisoner, and had nothing to say.
