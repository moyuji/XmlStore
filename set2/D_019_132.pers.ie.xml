<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Some of the <rs>Baltimore</rs> journals were disposed to congratulate themselves and the public generally upon the change of masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It was a poor business at best, as the <rs>Baltimore</rs> <hi rend="italics">South</hi> well observes, the attempt to reconcile a free people to the injustice and disgrace of their disfranchisement, by representing their new jailor as a decent, civil sort of person &mdash; as if it mattered greatly, if they were to be bound and scourged, whether the links that composed their chains should be square or round, or the cowhide that should be applied to their backs be <rs type="color">green</rs> or <rs type="color">red</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>To seek to define what is the law of nations in a royal proclamation would be, instead of a safeguard, a snare for the unlearned reader, since it would lead him to rely on an interpretation of that law which would not be binding on the court before which his case is to be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The answer that can be given to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ellenborough</foreName></persName> is that a blockade must be, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, a great deal more than a mere paper prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>A hen may be induced to believe that a broad chalk line forms a barrier which she cannot pass, but mankind have a right to require that, before their natural liberty be taken from them, something more substantial shall be interposed between them and the port they desire to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>On the other hand, it would be absurd to say that a blockade shall not be respected unless it be completely effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Such a rule would be to invite a perpetual breaking of blockades, since the very fact of a successful evasion would prove conclusively, according to the definition, that it was no blockade at all, on the same principle that treason never prospers, because rebellion, when triumphant, ceases to be treason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> Still less reasonable was the complaint of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ellenborough</foreName></persName>, that the proclamation did not enable plain men to find out what articles are contraband of war. A topic far more worthy of mature consideration than the question proposed by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ellenborough</foreName></persName> was the doctrine with regard to <q>&#x0022;privateering&#x0022;</q> enunciated by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Derby</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The argument of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Derby</foreName></persName> seems to be that the <rs>North</rs>, by declaring a blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, claims from neutral nations the respect due to its rights as a belligerent power; and therefore that, whatever the <rs>North</rs> may choose to do with the citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs> captured on board the privateers fitted out under letters of marque from <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, the <rs>North</rs> has no right to treat the belligerent rights of the <rs>South</rs> as a nullity with regard to the subjects of countries from whom it claims respect for its own belligerent rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The result would be that the <rs>North</rs>, by declaring a blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, has bound itself not to execute as pirates the subjects of neutral States serving on board such privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The argument is <num value="1">one</num> of great subtlety and refinement, and seemed to receive confirmation from the arguments of subsequent speakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It is clear that <name>English</name> subjects serving on board an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <q>&#x0022; privateer&#x0022;</q> are not pirates, though, if they choose so to act, the <rs>English Government</rs>, by the proclamation, seems to avow its intention of leaving them to a pirate's fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It may possibly deserve consideration whether this decision can be strictly adhered to. At any rate, we cannot doubt that the authoritative declaration of the law by so many judges of eminent authority will go very far to prevent the danger apprehended, and may possibly be the means of introducing into the very commencement of a dreadful civil war those principles of humanity and moderation the operation of which might otherwise be suspended until enforced and demonstrated by the barbarous logic of reprisals. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>This is probably an exaggeration, but a scant supply of cotton will make a financial crisis and a period of distress and starvation that would require vast Government aid, or there would be an insurrection or a revolution. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> You may be perfectly certain that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> will follow up the proclamation and the discussions in Parliament by every possible species of inference, and if nothing else will suffice, find a pretext <hi rend="italics">to declare war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</hi> to force them to abandon their present ground, and acknowledge the independence of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>It is not altogether from jealousy of your growing power, or love of interference, or a wish to break up the <rs>Union</rs>, or to secure a cotton supply, but they all have their influence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>I believe the sums that could be borrowed here, if this were done, would be small, but it is a part of the plan, and it gives encouragement to the <name>Southerners</name>. </p>

<head>Army organization.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> The following thoughts and suggestions may not be inopportune at the present moment, when the <rs>South</rs> is called upon to appeal to arms in defence of its most sacred rights and institutions, against the invasion of the <name>Goths</name> and Vandals of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The boasted and highly-cherished liberties of a free people can have no certain and enduring tenure, unless such people show that they are as ready and willing to do their own fighting as they are their own voting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> Whether the fighting to be done is to redress a wrong, or to repel an invasion, it will scarcely ever call for a levy <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">en masse</hi></foreign> to carry it on; therefore, the services of a portion only of the adult male population is necessary at any <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>To reach the portion or class thus needed is the proper object of military organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The concert and unity of action, without which an assembly of a great number of men is merely an unwieldy and helpless mass, or a dangerous mob, can only be secured by their obedience and submission to chiefs, under such classifications, divisions, and combinations, as will constitute them into <num value="1">one</num> harmonious body, moved by a common will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> All the officers and non-commissioned officers of a battalion, taken together, form what the <rs>French</rs> call the <name>Cadre</name> of a battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>This <hi rend="italics">cadre</hi> or skeleton, a word for which we have no exact <name>English</name> equivalent, is truly the soul of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>That organization which secures the existence of good <hi rend="italics">cadres,</hi> and the continued supply of a sufficient number of men to keep them filled, will fully develop the military power of any State, as far at least as the infantry arm, the principal element of armies, is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The organization of the military force of a country should be such that the prospect of victory, in time of war, may, as far as possible, be in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>But in order that the armed power of <num value="1">one</num> State may struggle against that of another, with some chance of success, it is at least necessary that it should be equal to its adversary in physical and moral strength, and in intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The physical force of an army depends upon its composition in men and in <hi rend="italics">material,</hi> and in the capacity of the former to use the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Its moral force depends upon its discipline, and upon the faith it has in its own courage, and the skill of its leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Its intelligence depends upon the sound knowledge which each man who makes a part of it has of his own duties, and upon the facility with which real capacity finds means of rendering itself useful and available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It must be evident that these important qualities depend in a great degree upon <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Indeed it is not likely that any of them will be found to exist in a high state, without the others being more or less developed; so that what is done to elevate a force in <num value="1">one</num> sense, will always tend to improve it in others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> In the remotest antiquity, hordes of people, under chiefs and leaders, often left their own homes, carrying devastation and conquest into strange lands, or enslaving or exterminating those who dwelt therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Struggles for such stakes as were constantly involved in war necessarily aroused all the higher passions of man, and naturally called into play his best talent and most creative genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The conduct of these struggles must soon have fallen under such rules and methods as constitute an art. The military art is only, however, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> known to us as practised by the <name>Greeks</name>, and subsequently by its great masters, the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>This art, which had reached such perfection under the <name>Consuls</name> of the <rs>Republic</rs>, underwent many vicissitudes during the wars conducted by the <rs>Generals</rs> of the <rs>Empire</rs>, through the long series of imperial reigns, down to those of <hi rend="smallcaps">Justinian</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Heraclins;</hi> when, like the last flash of an expiring light, it suddenly shot forth with a dense brilliancy, but only to fall back into utter darkness and oblivion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Now, after the lapse of many centuries, when <hi rend="smallcaps">Progress</hi> has again entered on <num value="1">one</num> of its great onward cycles, this art, through new and varied struggles, carried on with weapons and implements unknown to the ancients, has once more been developed, to an extent far exceeding its pristine excellence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>With the rise of this art, infantry, the popular branch of all armies, ascends in the scale of importance, as it did in the days of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Cyrus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Cyrus,nomatch:0"><surname>Cyrus</surname></persName>, <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, C&#x00C6;sar,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Belisarius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Belisarius,nomatch:0"><surname>Belisarius</surname></persName>.</hi> Whereas, in the middle or dark ages, when military art was lowest, and skill in single combat highest, cavalry became the principal arm; and if infantry appeared in the open field, they were ridden down by the men-at-arms, or driven before them as sheep fly before wolves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> Infantry, armed with rifle or musket and bayonet, is fit for all kinds of service; ordinarily, of <num value="2">two</num> battalions which are fighting, the <num value="1">one</num> which continues to advance in spite of the losses which it may sustain, carries the point, and remains master of the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/> <q>&#x0022;Clear ship for action,&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;all hands at quarters,&#x0022;</q> were now the orders given by our commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>These orders were soon obeyed, and we were prepared for the very pleasant pastime that was now about to take place.--The <rs>Anacostia</rs> took up a position a little on our port side, and somewhat further from shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>That solemn silence which always precedes the opening of fire in a naval engagement now ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>It was at length broken by the cheery voice of <persName n="Ward,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00375" reg="mostcommon:Ward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>, saying, <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;I am about to fire on the steamer.&#x0022; </q><bibl n="Captain Ward"></bibl></cit> Boom ! went the forward gun, and the shot pitched right ahead of the steamer, about her own length from her.--<q>&#x0022;Now,&#x0022; </q> said <persName n="Ward,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="mostcommon:Ward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>, &#x0022;I am going to aim at the depot,&#x0022; a red building at the end of the pier.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>The <rs>Freeborn</rs> now fired a number of round shots, still from her forward gun &mdash; for the after <num value="1">one</num> had not yet opened &mdash; just to get the proper elevation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>The proper elevation having been obtained, a shell was fired right into the depot, where it burst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot was a round <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pounder, which struck the water, and ricocheting, skimmed along the surface, burying itself at some distance from our port side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>The <rs>Anacostia</rs> occasionally put in a shot or a shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/><num value="1">One</num> of the latter struck the corner of the depot, which it completely tore away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>The engagement now became general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>Shot and shell were poured in on both sides; on our part with considerable effect, while those from the enemy generally fell short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Singularly as it may read, some <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of our shells actually burst under water, throwing up the spray to a considerable height. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>The sight was a solemn <num value="1">one</num>, but not devoid of a sort of terrific beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>The smoke from the enemy's guns, the flight of the shells, occasionally bursting in mid air, leaving a beautiful wreath of smoke where the explosion took place; the ricochet of the shots, skimming along the surface of the glassy-smooth river all made up a tableau that should be seen to be appreciated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>The sound of the guns, breaking on the air in notes of thunder, and the whistling of the balls, were no less worthy of notice than what met the vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>The reverberations among the distant hills was grand and terrific. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/> After we had been engaged for about <num value="3">three</num> quarters of an hour, the enemy's batteries (there were <num value="3">three</num> of them) near the depot were completely silenced, and we were congratulating ourselves on having done our work effectually, and as being out of danger from the battery on the summit of the hill to the left, when we soon found we were quite mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>A wreath of smoke is seen from a ravine, just below the hill already mentioned, and at the foot of a smaller hill adjoining, and, by <persName n="Thor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Thor,nomatch:0"><surname>Thor</surname></persName> ! a ball came whizzing just astern of us. The sound was most peculiar, resembling the sharp, shrill chirrup of a cricket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>It was apparent that this was from a rifled cannon, perhaps from a field piece, which was seen being dragged up the hill but a little while before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>The after gun &mdash; a short <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pounder, served by <rs type="role2">Master</rs>'s <persName n="Lee,Mate,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mate">Mate</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, under the direction of <persName n="Cash,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00379" reg="mostcommon:Cash,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Cash</surname></persName>--now opened fire for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, pitching shot right into the hill battery, but without doing much apparent execution, in consequence of the great distance and the height of the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>All this time, it must be remembered, that the <rs>Freeborn</rs> was almost stem on to the batteries near the depot, and that the forward gun was trained sharp forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>A slight variation was, however, made now and then, by bringing the vessel nearer broadside of, and the gun to bear more amidships, so as to get without the range of the enemy's shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>On the opening of the hill battery these tactics were altered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>The <rs>Freeborn</rs> was placed broadside on, so as to enable both guns to be brought to bear on the enemy, the after gun firing at the hill battery, while the forward gun &mdash; served by <persName n="Ward,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="mostcommon:Ward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt</roleName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName> himself, ably assisted by <rs type="role2">Master</rs>'s <persName n="Gray,Mate,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00381" reg="mostcommon:Gray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mate">Mate</roleName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName>, who, though still suffering from a sprained ankle, was as nimble as a lamp-lighter &mdash; fired a few rounds more at the depot batteries, so as to render the destruction complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>When this had been done to the entire satisfaction of <persName n="Ward,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="mostcommon:Ward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>, he trained his forward gun to bear on the hill battery, and blased a way. The enemy now fired in volleys; gun succeeding gun in such rapid succession that I had to close my note-book, in which I had been, to this moment, recording every shot from ourselves and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>The balls, or rather slugs, fell around us, across the how and the stern, and over our deck as thick as hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/><num value="1">One</num> ball went so close to my port ear that I felt what I had often heard and read of before &mdash; the wind of the ball. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>The enemy, in fact, fired with admirable precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/><num value="1">One</num> ball struck the ugly old long boat that was captured the other day, and which we have appropriated as a coal barge, and glancing off, fell into the water between her starboard side and the <rs>Freeborn</rs>, to the port side of which she was secured &mdash; thus doing us admirable service as a breastwork.--Another ball struck the water close to our port bow, and ricocheting, went through the planking of the bulwarks, tearing off a pretty large splinter; glancing thence it grazed the wrist of <persName n="Vickers,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="default:Vickers,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Vickers</surname></persName>, ordinary seaman, struck the gun carriage and fell upon deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>It proved to be a sugar-loaf shaped concern, about <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> in diameter, and from <num value="9">nine</num> to <measure n="10inches" type="distance">ten inches</measure> in length --an ugly customer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>I distinctly saw it come on board, for I was on the port side near the pilot-house, and really thought it had killed or severely wounded some of our gallant fellows who were working the bow gun, and was pleased, on inquiring, to find that such was not the fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/> It now became apparent that it was of no manner of use our firing at a battery that our guns could hardly reach, while the shallow water prevented us from going in close; therefore <persName n="Ward,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00384" reg="mostcommon:Ward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName> ceased firing &mdash; an example that was followed by the <name>Anacostin</name> &mdash; and we lay motionless on the water for some time, receiving the enemy's fire, which we did not return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/> It would be difficult to find in the whole range of fiction a more affecting incident than is contained in the following extract from a letter written by a British seaman to his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>It was his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> service as a soldier, he having been sent on shore with a boat's crew of marines to silence a fort and take some guns: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/> &#x0022;We dispersed at a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> distance from the beach to keep the coast clear, while the boat's crew made prizes of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>The enemy had advantage of the wood, and also knowing the country well; and a troop of them showed in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>We were ordered to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>I took steady aim and fired at my man at about <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure>. He fell like a stone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/> &#x0022;At the same time a broadside from &mdash; went in among the trees, and the enemy disappeared, we could scarcely tell how. I felt as though I must go up to him and see whether he was dead or alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>He lay quite still, and I was more afraid of him than when he stood facing me a few minutes before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>It is a strange feeling to come over you all at once that you have killed a man. He had unbuttoned his jacket; and was pressing his hand over the front of the chest where the wound was. He breathed hard, and the blood poured from the wound, and also from his mouth, every breath he took.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>His face was as white as death, and his eyes looked so big and bright as he turned them and stared at me.--I shall never forget it. He was a fine young fellow, not more than <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/> &#x0022;I went down on my knees beside him, and my breast felt so full as though my own heart would burst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>He had a real <name>English</name> face, and did not look like an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>What I felt, I never can tell; but if my life could have saved his. I believe I should have given it. I laid his head on my knee, and he grasped hold of my hand and tried to speak, but his voice was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>I could not tell a word he said, and every time he went to speak the blood poured out; so I knew it would soon be over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>I am not ashamed to say that I was worse than he, for he never shed a tear, and I couldn't help it. His eyes were closed, when a gun was fired from the --to order aboard, and that aroused him. He pointed to the beach where the boat was just pushing off with the guns which we had taken, and where our marines were waiting to man the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> boat, and then he pointed to the wood where the enemy was concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Poor fellow the little thought how I shot him down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>I was wondering how I could leave him to die, and no <num value="1">one</num> near him, when he had something like a convulsion for a moment, and then his face rolled over, and, without a sigh, he was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>I trust the <name>Almighty</name> has received his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>I laid his head gently down on the grass and left him. It seemed so strange when I looked at him for the last time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>I somehow thought of every thing I heard about the <name>Turks</name> and Russians, and the rest of them, but all that seemed so far off and the dead man so near.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="British seaman"></bibl></cit>
