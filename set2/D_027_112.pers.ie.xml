<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It has been prosecuted on a scale, and with an energy, heretofore unequalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>When we revert to the condition of our country at the inception of the operations of the present year, to the magnitude of the preparations made by the enemy, the number of his forces, the accumulation of his warlike supplies, and the prodigality with which his vast resources have been lavished in the attempt to render success assured; when we contrast the numbers and means at our disposal for resistance, and when we contemplate the results of a struggle apparently so unequal, we cannot fail, while rendering the full meed of deserved praise to our generals and soldiers, to perceive that a Power higher than man has willed our deliverance, and gratefully to recognize the protection of a kind <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> in enabling us successfully to withstand the utmost efforts of the enemy for our subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> At the beginning of the year, the <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName> was partially in possession of the enemy, and large portions of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> lay apparently defenceless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Of the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers who invaded <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, none are known to remain except as prisoners of war. In <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Louisiana</placeName>, a large and well-appointed army, aided by a powerful fleet, was repeatedly defeated, and deemed itself fortunate in finally escaping with a loss of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its numbers, a large part of its military trains and many transports and gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The enemy's occupation of that State is reduced to the narrow district commanded by the guns of his fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/><placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> has been recovered with the exception of a few fortified posts, while our forces have penetrated into <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">Central</rs> Missouri</placeName>, affording to our oppressed brethren in that State an opportunity, of which many have availed themselves, of striking for liberation from the tyranny to which they have been subjected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> On the east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, in spite of some reverses, we have much cause for gratulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The enemy hoped to effect, during the present year, by concentration of forces, the conquest which he had previously failed to accomplish by more extended operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Compelled, therefore, to withdraw or seriously to weaken the strength of the armies of occupation at different points, he has afforded us the opportunity of recovering possession of extensive districts of our territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Nearly the whole of Northern and Western, Mississippi, of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Alabama</placeName>, and of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, are again in our possession; and all attempts to penetrate from the coast line into the interior of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> and Gulf States have been baffled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>On the entire ocean and gulf coast of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the whole success of the enemy, with the enormous naval resources at his command, has been limited to the capture of the outer defences of <placeName reg="Mobile Bay, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,7017443">Mobile bay</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> If we now turn to the results accomplished by the <num value="2">two</num> great armies, so confidently relied on by the invaders as sufficient to secure the subversion of our Government and the subjection of our people to foreign domination, we have still greater cause for devout gratitude to Divine Power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>In <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, successive armies, which threatened the capture of <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2114113" n="1.000 23" reg="saltville, smyth, virginia">Saltville</placeName>, have been routed and driven out of the country, and a portion of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> reconquered by our troops.--In <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, extensive districts, formerly occupied by the enemy, are now free from their presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>In the lower Valley, their general, rendered desperate by his inability to maintain a hostile occupation, has resorted to the infamous expedient of converting a fruitful land into a desert by burning its mills, granaries and homesteads, and destroying the food, standing crops, live stock and <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs> of peaceful non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The main army, after a series of defeats, in which its losses have been enormous; after attempts by raiding parties to break up our railroad communications, which have resulted in the destruction of a large part of the cavalry engaged in the work; after constant repulse of repeated assaults on our defensive lines, is, with the aid of heavy reinforcements, but with, it is hoped, waning prospect of further progress in the design, still engaged in an effort, commenced more than <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> ago, to capture the town of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The same general who, in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, marched a large army from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Meridian, Lauderdale, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056956">Meridian</placeName> with no other result than being forced to march back again, was able, by the aid of greatly increased numbers, and after much delay, to force a passage from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, only to be for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time compelled to withdraw on the line of his &#x00E6;advance, without obtaining control of a single mile of territory beyond the narrow track of his march, and without gaining aught beyond the precarious possession of a few fortified points, in which he is compelled to maintain heavy garrisons, and which are menaced with recapture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> The lessons afforded by the history of this war are fraught with instruction and encouragement. --Repeatedly during the war have formidable expeditions been directed by the enemy against points ignorantly supposed to be of vital importance to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Some of these expeditions have, at immense cost, been successful; but in no instance have the promised fruits been reaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Again, in the present campaign, was the delusion fondly cherished that the capture of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would, if effected, end the war by the overthrow of our Government and the submission of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>We can now judge by experience how unimportant is the influence of the former event upon our capacity for defence, upon the courage and spirit of the people, and the stability of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>We may, in like manner, judge that, if the campaign against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> had resulted in success instead of failure; if the valor of the army, under the leadership of its accomplished commander, had resisted in vain the overwhelming masses which were, on the contrary, decisively repulsed; if we had been compelled to evacuate <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as well as <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> would have remained as erect and defiant as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Nothing could have been changed in the purpose of its Government, in the indomitable valor of its troops, or in the unquenchable spirit of its people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The baffled and disappointed foe would in vain have scanned the reports of your proceedings, at some new legislative seat, for any indication that progress had been made in his gigantic task of conquering a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The truth, so patent to us, must, ere long, be forced upon the reluctant Northern mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>There are no vital points on the preservation of which the continued existence of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> depends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>There is no military success of the enemy which can accomplish its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Not the <rs n="Fall of Richmond" type="battle">fall of Richmond</rs>, nor <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, nor <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, nor <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, nor <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, nor of all combined, can save the enemy from the constant and exhaustive drain of blood and treasure which must continue until he shall discover that no peace is attainable unless based on the recognition of our indefeasible rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> Before leaving this subject, it is gratifying to assure you that the military supplies essentially requisite for public defence will be found, as heretofore, adequate to our needs; and that abundant crops have rewarded the labor of the farmer, and rendered abortive the inhuman attempt of the enemy to produce, by devastation, famine among the people. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> No instance in history is remembered by me in which a nation pretending to exercise dominion ever another, asserting its, independence, has been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to concede the existence of such independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>No case can be recalled to my mind in which neutral powers have failed to set the example of recognizing the independence of a nation, when satisfied of the inability of its enemy to subvert its Government; and this, too, in cases where the previous relation between the contending parties had been confessedly <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> that of mother-country and dependent colony; not, as in our case, that of co-equal States united by Federal compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>It has ever been considered the proper function and duty of neutral powers to perform the office of judging whether, in point of fact, the nation asserting dominion is able to make good its pretensions by force of arms, and if not, by recognition of the resisting party, to discountenance the further continuance of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>And the reason why this duty is incumbent on neutral power is plainly apparent, when we reflect that the pride and passion which blind the judgment of the parties to the conflict cause the continuance of active warfare, and consequent useless slaughter, long after the inevitable result has become apparent to all not engaged in the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>So long, therefore, as neutral nations fail, by recognition of our independence, to announce that, in their judgment, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are unable to reduce the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to submission, their conduct will be accepted by our enemies as a tacit encouragement to continue their efforts, and as an implied assurance that belief is entertained by neutral nations in the success of their designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>A direct stimulus, whether intentional or not, is thus applied to securing a continuance of the carnage and devastation which desolate this continent, and which they profess deeply to deplore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> The disregard of this just, humane, and <name>Christian</name> public duty by the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is the more remarkable from the fact that authentic expression has long since been given by the <name>Governments</name> of both <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> to the conviction that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are unable to conquer the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It is now more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> since the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> announced officially to the <name>Cabinets</name> of <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName> and <placeName reg="Saint Petersburg, Pinellas, Florida" key="tgn,7014446">St. Petersburg</placeName> its own conclusion that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were unable to achieve any decisive military success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>In the answers sent by those Powers no intimation of a contrary opinion was conveyed; and it is notorious that, in speeches, both in and out of Parliament, the members of Her Britannic Majesty's Government have not hesitated to express this conviction in unqualified terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The denial of our right under these circumstances is so obviously unjust, and discriminates so unfairly in favor of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, that neutrals have sought to palliate the wrong, of which they are conscious, by professing to consider, in opposition to notorious truth and to the known belief of both belligerents, that the recognition of our independence would be valueless without their further intervention in the struggle; an intervention of which we disclaim the desire and mistrust the advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>We seek no favor; we wish no intervention; we know ourselves fully competent to maintain our own rights and independence against the invaders of our country; and we feel justified in asserting that, without the aid derived from recruiting their armies from foreign countries, the invaders would, ere this, have been driven from our soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>When the recognition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was refused by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the fall of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the refusal was excused on the ground that any action by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government would have the effect of inflaming the passions of the belligerents and of preventing the return of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It is assumed that this opinion was sincerely entertained; but the experience of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of unequalled carnage shows that it was erroneous, and that the result was the reverse of what the <rs>British Ministry</rs> humanely desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>A contrary policy, a policy just to us, a policy diverging from an unvarying course of concession to all the demands of our enemies, is still within the power of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government, and would, it is fair to presume, be productive of consequences the opposite of those which have unfortunately followed its whole course of conduct from the commencement of the war to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>In a word, peace is impossible without independence, and it is not to be expected that the enemy will anticipate neutrals in the recognition of that independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>When the history of this war shall be fully disclosed, the calm judgment of the impartial publicist will, for these reasons, be unable to absolve the neutral nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from a share in the moral responsibility for the myriads of human lives that have been unnecessarily sacrificed during its progress. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Indeed, if the estimates now presented should prove to be as much in excess of actual expenditures as has heretofore been the case, a considerable balance will still remain unexpended at the close of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the ensuing year. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> The condition of the various branches of the military service is stated in the accompanying report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Among the suggestions made for legislative action with a view to add to the numbers and efficiency of the army, all of which will receive your consideration, there are some prominent topics which merit special notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> The exemption from military duty now accorded by law to all persons engaged in certain specified pursuits or professions is shown by experience to be unwise; nor is it believed to be defensible in theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The defence of home, family and country is universally recognized as the paramount political duty of every member of society; and in a form of government like ours, where each citizen enjoys an equality of rights and privileges, nothing can be more invidious than an unequal distribution of duties and obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>No pursuit nor position should relieve any <num value="1">one</num> who is able to do active duty from enrollment in the army, unless his functions or services are more useful to the defence of his country in another sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>But it is manifest that this cannot be the case with entire classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>All telegraph operators, workmen in mines, professors, teachers, engineers, editors and employees of newspapers, journeymen printers, shoemakers, tanners, blacksmiths, millers, physicians, and the numerous other classes mentioned in the laws, cannot, in the nature of things, be either equally necessary in their several professions, nor distributed throughout the country in such proportions that only the exact numbers required are found in each locality; nor can it be everywhere impossible to replace those within the <sic>consript</sic> age by men older and less capable of active field services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>A discretion should be vested in the military authorities, so that a sufficient number of those essential to the public service might be detailed to continue the exercise of their pursuits or professions; but the exemption from service of the entire classes should be wholly abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>It affords great facility for abuses, offers the temptation, as well as the ready means, of escaping service by fraudulent devices, and is <num value="1">one</num> of the principal obstructions to the efficient operation of the conscript laws. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> A general militia law is needful in the interest of the public defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The Constitution, by vesting the power in Congress, imposes on it the duty of providing &#x0022;for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.&#x0022; The great diversity in the legislation of the several States on this subject, and the absence of any provision establishing an exact method for calling the militia into Confederate service, are sources of embarrassment which ought no longer to be suffered to impede defensive measures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> The legislation in relation to the cavalry demands change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The policy of requiring the men to furnish their own horses has proven pernicious in many respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>It interferes with discipline, impairs efficiency, and is the cause of frequent and prolonged absence from appropriate duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The subject is fully treated in the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s report, with suggestions as to the proper measures for reforming that branch of the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> The recommendation, hitherto often made, is again renewed, that some measure be adopted for the re-organization and consolidation of companies and regiments when so far reduced in numbers as seriously to impair their efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It is the more necessary that this should be done, as the absence of legislation on the subject has forced generals in the field to resort to various expedients for approximating the desired end. It is surely an evil that a commanding officer should be placed in a position which forces upon him the choice of allowing the efficiency of his command to be seriously impaired, or of attempting to supply by the exercise of doubtful authority the want of proper legal provision.--The regard for the sensibility of officers who have heretofore served with credit, and which is believed to be the controlling motive that has hitherto obstructed legislation on this subject, however honorable and proper, may be carried to a point which seriously injures the public good; and if this be the case, it can scarcely be questioned which of the <num value="2">two</num> considerations should be deemed paramount. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> The <rs>Secretary</rs>'s recommendations on the subject of facilitating the acquisition of the iron required for maintaining the efficiency of railroad communication on the important military lines are commended to your favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The necessity for the operation, in full vigor, of such lines is too apparent to need comment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> The question in dispute between the <num value="2">two</num> Governments relative to the exchange of prisoners of war has been frequently presented in former messages and reports, and is fully treated by the <rs>Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The solicitude of the <rs>Government</rs> for the relief of our captive fellow-citizens has known no abatement; but has, on the contrary, been still more deeply evoked by the additional sufferings to which they have been wantonly subjected, by deprivation of adequate food, clothing and fuel, which they were not even permitted to purchase from the prison sutlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Finding that the enemy attempted to excuse their barbarous treatment by the unfounded allegation that it was retaliatory for like conduct on our part, an offer was made by us with a view of ending all pretext for such recriminations or pretended retaliation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> The offer has been accepted, and each Government is, hereafter, to be allowed to provide necessary comforts to its own citizens held captive by the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Active efforts are in progress for the immediate execution of this agreement, and it is hoped that but few days will elapse before we shall be relieved from the distressing thought that painful physical suffering is endured by so many of our follow-citizens whose fortitude in captivity illustrates the national character as fully as did their valor in actual conflict. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="6"> 
<head>Employment of slaves.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> The employment of slaves for service with the army as teamsters or cooks, or in the way of work upon fortifications, or in the <rs>Government</rs> workshops, or in hospitals, and other similar duties, was authorized by the act of <date value="02-17">17th February</date> last, and provision was made for their impressment to a number not exceeding <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>, if it should be found impracticable to obtain them by contract with the owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The law contemplated the hiring only of the labor of these slaves, and imposed on the <rs>Government</rs> the liability to pay for the value of such as might be lost to the owners from casualties resulting from their employment in the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> This act has produced less result than was anticipated, and further provision is required to render it elicitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But my present purpose is to invite your consideration to the propriety of a radical modification in the theory of the law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> Viewed merely as property, and therefore as the subject of impressment, the service or labor of the slave has been frequently claimed for short periods in the construction of defensive works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The slave however, bears another relation to the <rs>State</rs>, that of a person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The law of last <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> contemplates only the relation of the slave to the master, and limits the impressment to a certain term of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>But for the purposes enumerated in the act, instruction in the manner of encamping, marching and parking trains is needful, so that, even in this limited employment, length of service adds greatly to the value of the negro's labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/><persName n="Hazard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Hazard,nomatch:0"><surname>Hazard</surname></persName> is also encountered in all the positions to which the negroes can be assigned for service with the army, and the duties required of them demand loyalty and zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>In this aspect, the relation of person predominates so far as to render it doubtful whether the private right of property can consistently and beneficially be continued, and it would seem proper to acquire for the public, and to pay therefore due compensation, rather than to impress his labor for short terms; and this the more especially as the effect of the present law would vest this entire property in all cases where the slave might be recaptured after compensation for his loss had been paid to the private owner.--Whenever the entire property in the service of a slave is thus acquired by the <rs>Government</rs>, the question is presented, by what tenure he should be held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Should he be retained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/><unclear></unclear> servitude, or should his emancipation be held out to him as a reward for faithful service, or should it be granted at once on the promise of such service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>and if emancipated, what action should be taken to secure for the freedman the permission of the <rs>State</rs> from which he was drawn to reside within its limits after the close of his public service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The permission would doubtless be more readily accorded as a reward for past faithful service; and a double motive for serious discharge of duty would thus be offered to those employed by the <rs>Government</rs>, their freedom, and the gratification of the local attachment which is so marked a characteristic of the negro, and forms so powerful an incentive to his action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The policy of engaging to liberate the negro on his discharge after service faithfully rendered, seems to me preferable to that of granting immediate manumission, or that of retaining him in servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>If this policy should recommend itself to the judgment of Congress, it is suggested that, in addition to the duties heretofore performed by the slave, he might be advantageously employed as pioneer and engineer laborer; and in that event, that the number should be augmented to <num value="40000">forty thousand</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Beyond this limit and these employments, it does not seem to me desirable, under existing circumstances, to go. A broad, moral distinction exists between the use of slaves as soldiers in the defence of their homes, and the incitement of the same persons to insurrection against their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The <num value="1">one</num> is justifiable, if necessary; the other is iniquitous and unworthy of a civilized people; and such is the judgment of all writers on public law, as well as that expressed and insisted on by our enemies in all ware prior to that now waged against us. By none have the practices, of which they are now guilty, been denounced with greater severity than by themselves in the <num value="2">two</num> wars with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the last and in the present century; and in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, when enumeration was made of the wrongs which justified the revolt from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the climax of atrocity was deemed to be reached only when the <rs>English</rs> monarch was denounced as having &#x0022;excited domestic insurrections amongst us.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> The subject is to be viewed by us, therefore, solely in the light of policy and our social economy.--When so regarded, I must dissent from those who advise a general levy and arthing of the slaves for the duty of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Until our white population shall prove insufficient for the armies we require and can afford to keep in the field, to employ, as a soldier, the negro, who has merely been trained to labor, and as laborer, the white man, accustomed from his youth to the use of fire-arms, would scarcely be deemed wise or advantageous by any; and this is the question now before us. But should the alternative ever be presented of subjugation or of the <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> employment of the slave <unclear></unclear> a soldier, there seems no reason to doubt what should, then be our decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Whether our view embraces what would, in so extreme a case, be the sum of misery entailed by the dominion of the enemy, or be restricted solely to the effect upon the welfare and happiness of the negro population themselves, the result would be the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The appalling demoralization, suffering, disease and death which have been caused by partially substituting the invader's system of police for the kind relation previously subsisting between the master and slave, have been a sufficient demonstration that external interference with our institution of domestic slavery is productive of evil only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>If the subject involved no other consideration than the mere right of property, the sacrifices heretofore made by our people have been such as to permit no doubt of their readiness to surrender every possession in order to secure their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>But the social and political question, which is exclusively under the control of the several States, has a far wide and more enduring importance than that of pecuniary interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>In its manifold phases, it embraces the stability of our <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> institutions, resting on the actual political equality of all its citizens, and includes the fulfillment of the task which has been so happily begun &mdash; that of Christianizing and improving the condition of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> who have, by the will of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, been placed in our charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Comparing the results of our own experience with those of the experiments of others who have borne similar relation to the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> race, the people of the several States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have abundant reason to be satisfied with the past, and to use the greatest circumspection in determining their course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>There considerations, however, are rather applicable to the improbable contingency of our need of resorting to this element of resistance than to our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>If the recommendation, above made, for the training of <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> negroes for the service indicated shall meet your approval, it is certain that even this limited number, by their preparatory training in intermediate duties, would form a more valuable reserve forces in case of urgency than <num value="3">three</num>-fold their number suddenly called from field labor; while a fresh levy could, to a certain extent, supply their places in the special service for which they are now employed. </p> </div4>

<head>Negotiations for peace.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> The disposition of this Government for a peaceful solution of the issues which the enemy has referred to the arbitrament of arms has been too often manifested, and is too well known, to need new assurances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>But while it is flue that individuals and parties in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have indicated a desire to substitute reason for force, and by negotiation to stop the further sacrifice of human life and to arrest the calamities which now afflict both countries, the authorities who control the <rs>Government</rs> of our enemies have too often and too clearly expressed their resolution to make no peace except on terms of our unconditional submission and degradation, to leave us any hope of the cessation of hostilities until the delusion of their ability to conquer us is dispelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Among those who are already disposed for peace, many are actuated by principle and by disapproval and abhorrence of the iniquitous warfare that their Government is waging, while others and moved by the conviction that it is no longer to the interest of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to continue a struggle in which success is unattainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Whenever this fast growing conviction shall have taken firm root in the minds of a majority of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, there will be produced that willingness to negotiate for peace which is now confined to our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Peace is manifestly impossible unless desired by both parties to this war, and the disposition for it among our enemies will be best and most certainly evoked by the demonstration on our part of ability and unshaken determination to defend our rights, and to hold no earthly price too dear for their purchase.
