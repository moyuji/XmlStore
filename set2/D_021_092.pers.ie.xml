<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> <num value="1">One</num> case is strongly urged by leading citizens of the interior that I will specially mention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> A <rs n="Baptist" type="religion">Baptist</rs> preacher, who had in charge some <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> churches in the interior of the <rs>State</rs> when the rebellion assumed an active form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A company was organized, composed mainly, of his congregations, and he was (as stated) strongly urged by the parents of the young men to go along, and see after and care for their sons.--that he left home as <rs type="role" reg="Captain">Captain</rs> of the company, and has ever since been with <orgName n="army"><persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Price,W.,,,:1"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>But I am informed that he has of late assumed the more peaceful station of <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It is now said by his friends that he desires to return home and lead a more quiet life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> His wife, a most excellent and worthy lady, writes me to know if I can procure a parole for her husband, and a permit for how to be the bearer of it to <orgName n="army"><persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Price,W.,,,:1"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, saying that her husband would gladly return home and take no more part in the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> As I am anxious to oblige the friends who write to me in this case, and who I believe, have all been faithful to the <rs>Government</rs>, will you be kind enough to give the subject your attention, (if your important duties will permit,) and let me know what answer to give to this and similar, inquiries, now becoming frequent from friends throughout the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Sir &mdash; Your letter of this date is received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In answer to your inquiries, I have to state that persons in arms against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Price,W.,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>, can be received only as prisoners of war, and that they will be treated in the same kind and lenient manner as others have been who are willing to abandon a hopeless and unholy cause, take the prescribed oath of allegiance, and give satisfactory security, for their future good conduct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Any <num value="1">one</num> who voluntarily takes the oath, and gives his parole of honor, and afterwards violates it by aiding or abetting the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>will most certainly be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A man who violates his military parcel commits the most serious of all military offences, and I will pardon no <num value="1">one</num> who is guilty of that crime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> In regard to the wife of <persName n="Chaplain,Reverend,Captain,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Chaplain,Captain,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Reverend</roleName> <foreName>Captain</foreName> <surname>Chaplain</surname></persName>, in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Price,W.,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, who wishes to visit her husband, please inform her that no such permission can be granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Nearly all the <name>Secessionists</name> of this State who have entered the rebel service have left their wives and daughters to the care of the <rs>Union</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>There is scarcely a single instance where this confidence has been abused by us. But what return have these ladies made for this protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>In many cause they have acted as spies and informers for the enemy, and have been most loud- mouthed in their abuse of our cause, and most insulting in their conduct toward those who support it Under any other Government they would for such conduct, be expelled from the country of confined within the walls of a prison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> I am well aware that some good Union men in the interior of the <rs>State</rs> think that those now serving the rebel cause under <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Price,W.,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName> should be permitted to return to their homes without being considered prisoners of war, or, when taken prisoners of war, that they should be released simply on promise of future good conduct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Experience has satisfied me that such a course would neither be wise nor safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>In deed, I find that the very persons who advocate a more lenient policy toward returned Secessionists, are also continually petitioning to have additional troops sent to their counties to protect them from the operations of these same rebels. </p> <closer> <salute>Very respectfully, your ob't servant.</salute> <signed><persName n="Halleck,,H.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName>  <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>.</signed> </closer> </div5> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> The campaign in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has at last begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>A naval battle and a general advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> army on the <rs>Potomac</rs> are the events which we record to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these is <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting incidents that have marked the war. For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, the newest applications of science have been tested in a fight between foes of equal courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Who would have thought it possible that after <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> had theorized so long on iron-plated and iron-prowed vessels, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> real trial should be made by the inhabitants of the peaceful <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> met in unnatural strife, and, furthermore, that victory should rest with the party less versed in naval-tactics-and-construction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Though for a long time there has been mention of the <rs>Merrimac</rs> in the <rs>Southern</rs> papers, we were not prepared for the achievements in the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> The <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> frigate seems to have gained an easy victory over her <hi rend="italics">wooden opponents.</hi> The accounts of the action are rather vague, but it appears that she disabled the <rs>Cumberland</rs> and the <rs>Congress</rs> in a very showtime, fulfilling in the most complete manner the expectations that have been formed concerning iron-plated vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>She received the broadsides of <num value="2">two</num> of her opponents at <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> without sustaining any damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>She then ran into the <rs>Cumberland</rs> with her iron prow and laid open her sides Thus, both in defence and attack, the <rs>Merrimac</rs> has realized the calculations of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> constructors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It must now be looked upon as proved, that wooden vessels go to sure and speedy defeat whenever they venture into action against an iron-plated adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Those who object to iron sides, that they are not invulnerable, inasmuch as, however strong the ship may be, cannon can be constructed powerful enough to pierce it, must we think, abandon their too captious criticism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> We see in the <rs>Merrimac</rs> that a vessel can be made practically invulnerable, even to the heavy naval guns which are at present in use. Nothing now remains for our Admiralty but to discontinue the building of wooden vessels, and to convert all that will bear it into machines of war resembling the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> frigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The only real opponent which the <rs>Merrimac</rs> found was another iron-plated frigate, and, had it not been for this <term type="ship">vessel</term>, <rs type="ship">It</rs> is possible that the <rs>Merrimac</rs> might have destroyed the whole <orgName n="Federal Squadron" type="squadron">Federal squadron</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The <rs>Merrimac</rs> is described as <q> &#x0022;covered with sloping iron plates, extending <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> below the water line, and meeting above like the roof of a house.&#x0022;</q> This peculiarity of construction may possibly not be necessary to efficiency; but, as a vessel thus built has actually made a great success, it would be worth while fully to examine the principle before constructing any more of our own, on the plan already adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> The equipment of the <rs>Merrimac</rs> shows that there are good heads in the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> of the <rs>South</rs>, and the gallant manner in which she was handled in action is a token that the <rs>Confederate</rs> courage it still as high as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>But it is not by sea fights that the fortunes of the new republic are to be determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The brilliant affair of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> will, no doubt, do much to reanimates the <name>Southerners</name> after their successive defeats, but in itself it is of little importance. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>These expectations have certainly been justified by the naval victory which we yesterday reported a victory gained over a Federal force of great strength, and in waters where the <name>Northerners</name> probably conceived that the supremacy was unassailably their own. <num value="3">Three</num> frigates and a heavy sloop are mentioned as either taking, or endeavoring to take, a part in the action against the small squadron of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and a further and most effective reinforcement afterwards arrived in the shape of a <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> From the reports of the action, It appears that the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, through mounting only <num value="12">twelve</num> guns, did not hesitate to proceed in company with the <num value="2">two</num> other steamers, in search of an encounter with such a squadron as we have described above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The <rs>Minnesota</rs> however got aground, and could therefore, neither come up herself nor tow the <rs>St. Lawrence</rs> into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The <rs>Merriman</rs> and her attendants had consequently only <num value="1">one</num> frigate and a sloop to deal with, and it seems that the took the sloop to herself, and left the frigate to the other steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/><placeName key="the cumberland river" n="1.000 19" reg="">The Cumberland</placeName> had not a chance against her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>After this she poured a broadside into her antagonist, dashed <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> as her ones more, and then left her to sink Nothing could be more successful of destructive than her <unclear></unclear> caused. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> Facts like these <unclear></unclear> well indicated to reflect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>We find, that a wooden vessel, when matched against an iron <num value="1">one</num>, is literally as helpless as was predicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The <rs>Merrimac</rs> did actually knock the <rs>Cumberland</rs> <q>&#x0022;into matches,&#x0022;</q> and in a very few minutes; but when she was encountered by a ship of her own class, an action of <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> ended; with no great damage to either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Yet we cannot imagine that either of these vessels makes any approach, in strengthen power, to the frigates we have built on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>. --The Monitor was to be finished in <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure>, and at a cost of loss than &#x00A3; <num value="60000">60,000</num>,while the urgent needs of the <rs>Confederates</rs> forbid us to believe that any great amount of time or money can have been expended on the <rs>Merrimac Nevertheless</rs> these extemporized iron-sides are sufficient to give a character to the whole war, and if they and not neutralized each other either of them would probably have given a good account of an entire squadron of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>What a sailing ship is to a steamer an ordinary steamer is to an iron, clad frigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>It will be remembered that the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> were slow to recognize the new principle, and most reluctant to adopt it; but when the time for action arrived, necessity made itself felt, and they have now given the theory all the practical confirmation it needed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> There is <num value="1">one</num> other conclusion too, which we may craw from the operations of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The alleged efficiency of gunboats against heavier vessels has been disproved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The Confederates appear to have built upon this theory at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but their <q>&#x0022;mosquitoes motiles&#x0022;</q> have never succeeded.--Neither at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> nor <placeName reg="Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia" key="tgn,7014343">Roanoke</placeName> did their swarm of gunboats produce the least effect against the large ships of the <rs>Federal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Vessels, of this class operating upon rivers in conjunction with land forces have proved of the greatest service; indeed, the <name>Northerners</name> owe most of their successor to them but in narrow seas, and against heavy frigates or sloops, the small craft have been round as useless as a fleet of <unclear></unclear>.

<head>Startling intelligence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> On yesterday morning, while the regular mail and passenger train on the <rs type="place">State Road</rs> was stopped at <placeName reg="Camp McDonald">Camp McDonald</placeName>, or Big Shanty, and the engineer, conductor, and passengers at breakfast, some <num value="4">four</num> men as yet unknown, after having cut loose all but the foremost <num value="3">three</num> cars, got upon the engine, put on steam and shot away like an arrow, leaving the baggage and passenger cars, passengers, conductor, engineer, and train hands, lost in amazement at this unparalleled and daring outrage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/> Some distance above they tore up the track and cut down the telegraph wires and went on, stating to those who inquired who they ware, or what such an unusual train meant, that they had some car loads of powder, and that the engine and train had been pressed that morning by the <rs>Government</rs> in great haste to carry the powder to our forces near <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> They arrived at <placeName reg="Kingston, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2023318">Kingston</placeName>, where they met the down freight train and want upon the turn- out &mdash; showing that they understood the schedule and minutest workings of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>As the train passed them, the conductor thereon made the same inquiry of them concerning the unusual train, and received the same answer &mdash; taking powder to <orgName n="army"><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00365" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>As soon as the down train passed, and the switch could be changed, they shot away with all their speed and mystery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/> We learn that a train had been put in pursuit of them &mdash; having repaired the track &mdash; and hopes to overtake them before they reach any of the many bridges across the <rs>Chickamauga</rs> and other streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>No doubt they are <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00366" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> schemes, sent down among us to destroy those bridges to retard our movements of troops, and the thought is a very serious <num value="1">one</num> to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> For cool impudence and reckless daring, this beats anything we ever heard or read of. We are in an agony of suspense to hear the <unclear></unclear> of this strange and daring achievement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> P. S.--Since the foregoing was in type, we have received additional particulars, though nothing later. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/> The conductor at Big Shanty, <persName n="Falier,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="mostcommon:Falier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Falier</surname></persName>, as soon as he found his engine gone in so mysterious and startling a manner, brought into requisition a hand car, which, luckily, was at that place, and followed on with all speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>He soon came to where a rail had been torn up and was carried off; but the hand car was soon lifted over and again in hot pursuit.--On the way he learned that the engine had stopped to take in wood and water, representing that they had powder in the cars for our army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/> At Stowah <persName n="Fuller,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="mostcommon:Fuller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> obtained an engine from <persName n="Cooper,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>, and pressed on with it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/> Arriving at <placeName key="tgn,2075343" n="1.000 86" reg="kinston, lenoir, north carolina">Kinston</placeName> he got the <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> road engine, with its engineer, all in fine condition, with perhaps <num value="40">40</num> men, and pressed on.--He was just <measure n="25minutes" type="date">25 minutes</measure> behind the fugitive train when he left <placeName key="tgn,2075343" n="1.000 86" reg="kinston, lenoir, north carolina">Kinston</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/> At <unclear></unclear> the regular passenger trains (up and down) meet, and the thieves would have to pass them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The down train, due here at <time value="4pm">4 P. M.</time>, has not yet (<time value="9pm">9 P. M.</time>) arrived, and it is feared there has been a collision with the engine, though the torn-up track may be the cause of the delay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> Various surmises looking to a solution of the mystery, are indulged here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Everybody at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> concluded that it was a most daring effort of some Lincolnites to burn the bridges to stop the transportation of troops over the <rs type="place">State Road</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>It is reported that the whole of the troops at <placeName reg="Camp McDonald">Camp McDonald</placeName> were going off yesterday morning; and a large number of soldiers troop &mdash; came through here last night on their way to the scene of action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/> Some said there really was ammunition in the <num value="3">three</num> box cars-which they carried off, and that the object was to take it to the enemy at <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>We, however, learn officially that the cars attached to the engine were empty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/> Another solution, which has gained credence, and is not at all improbable, is, that they were simply thieves on a large scale, had took this method to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>We learn that a very large amount of money was stolen in this <unclear></unclear> night before last, and it is not improbable that these men were the thieves, and took this method to escape-- <hi rend="italics">Atlanta Confederacy, <date value="04-13">April 13</date></hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
