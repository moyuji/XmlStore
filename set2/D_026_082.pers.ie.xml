<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Sir, I have a question to put to the noble lord, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Minister, which I am very anxious that he should himself answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I will preface this question with <num value="2">two</num> preliminary statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that my honorable and learned friend, the <rs type="role" reg="Solicitor-General">Solicitor General</rs>, informed this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government were prepared to remonstrate with the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> on their employment of agents in this country for illegal purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I would suggest to my honorable and learned friend that he was speaking about a matter which was <hi rend="italics">sub judice;</hi> that he spoke not merely in his own person, and that person <num value="1">one</num> to whom we all pay very great respect, but in the character of a great law officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>And not only that, but by his side sat the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">attorney General</rs>, and it was quite clear that he spoke the opinion of the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Moreover, he was the only member of the ministry who spoke on that occasion, so that he might be supposed to be the organ of the <name>Administration</name> in himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The matter on which he spoke was then under the consideration of the law courts, and he expressed distinctly an opinion upon it. I think it would have been wiser it he had abstained altogether from any expression of opinion on a matter of that sort, especially in this <name>House</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But the question being <hi rend="italics">sub judice,</hi> we have to inquire at what point the transactions then were </p> </q><bibl n="Mr. Roebuck"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> It appears to me, sir, that they were exactly at this point: that the <rs>Government</rs> believed certain things were being done by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName> in this country which they held to be illegal; that they had brought those things before the courts of law, and that, as far as we have now gone, the courts of law have decided against the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>No doubt there was an appeal, and that appeal (I know not what may have happened to day) is still <hi rend="italics">sub judice.</hi> Therefore we may say that the <rs>Government</rs>, on mere suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><hi rend="italics">are about to remonstrate with the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.</hi> That is my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The next <num value="1">one</num> is that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <rs type="role" reg="Minister">Minister</rs> of the <name>Crown</name> has stated as his policy &mdash; and every other member of the <rs>Government</rs> who has spoken on the subject has said the same thing &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Minister has stated that they wish to maintain <hi rend="italics">the strictest neutrality</hi> between the <rs>Federal</rs> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Now, I believe that the noble lord at the head of the <rs>Government</rs> really desires to do that; but I am afraid that the noble lord at the head of the <rs>Government</rs> is not altogether master of the <rs>Government</rs>.--There are other powers in the <rs>Government</rs>, and there is <num value="1">one</num> great power that I think somewhat overshadows him and the whole administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>[Hear, hear] The noble ford, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Minister has won for himself not only the confidence of the country, but I believe its affectionate regard--[hear, hear]--and anything that he says he will do we are perfect confidence that he means to do. But there is another power by the side of that noble lord, and a power such as has always appeared in the liberal government of this country since the days of the revolution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> We have always had some member of what is called a revolution family in a liberal administration, who has governed perverted, and destroyed it [laughter.] <hi rend="italics">The person to whom I allude <unclear></unclear></hi> and I may say that the honor of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in his hands has not shone forth with the brightness that I could have Wighes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>[Hear, hear.]--Let us go sir, from <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000120" n="1.000 78" reg="nihon">Japan</placeName>, though that is not far. [A laugh.] But it I go farther if I go to <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>, then to <placeName reg="Danmark, Europe, " key="tgn,1000066">Denmark</placeName>, and lastly to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, <unclear></unclear> every case I find that the honor, the name of <unclear></unclear>, has been tarnished by what has taken place [Hear, hear.] Sir, I have read the dispatch on this matter, and the feeling predominant in my mind was that of dire humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>[Hear, hear.] I felt that the honor of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was not upheld as thought to have been, and that the strict neutrality which the noble lord the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Minister, professes, and professes honestly, I am sure, was not maintained. --Why, sir, the tone used was, in the first place, like the screams of a cockatoo or the scolding of an angry woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>[Laughter.] The end was most unequal to the beginning, the words were big but the deeds were the least possible </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/><num value="2526">Two thousand five hundred and twenty-six</num> newspapers were published in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by far the greater proportion in the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> If church buildings could make a people religious, if the means of education and the opportunities of knowledge could render them virtuous, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ought to be the best people in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Or, if civilization consists in material development, they ought to be the most civilized of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>If civilization consists in steam, machinery, ships, electricity, and gas, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should be the most civilized of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Instead of all this, their conduct in the present invasion has proved them the most vicious and the most barbarous of nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> We do not pretend that this is the result of their civilization, but it is proof that their ideas of civilization are false, and that, in the true sense of that term, they have never been civilized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Churches, in many of which the principal doctrines of Christianity are denied, and pulpits in which malice, hatred, and all uncharitableness are preached, can scarcely be received as indications of a popular acceptance of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>In point of fact, infidelity pervades <num value="1">one</num> portion of the <rs>Northern</rs> population, and fanaticism another, leaving but a helpless minority who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The impotency of education, unassisted by higher influences, to improve the natural character, is shown by the complete failure of newspapers, schools and colleges, to elevate the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> population above the animal passions of brutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The naked savage of the wilderness, who has never seen the impression of a type on paper, nor heard of such a thing as a school or a university could not be more brutal in his instincts, nor more ferocious in his hatred, than the amalgamating and house and city burning population of the <rs>Northern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> If that population is a fair representation of the so-called civilization of the world, then the limits between that condition and barbarism are narrow indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The difference between the <num value="2">two</num> is an external habit of life and dress, and in the acquisition of knowledge rather than any moral dissimilarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is but the barbarian dressed in broadcloth, knowing all about steam and machinery, and conforming externally to the usages of civilized society, but still at heart a savage, who will prove himself true to his original instincts whenever an opportunity is afforded him like the present war to disclose his true nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Educate, Unitarianism, and Unionize this savage as you will the leopard cannot change his spots, nor the <rs n="Ethiopian" type="ethnic">Ethiopian</rs> his skin, nor the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> hand refrain, when not prevented by the sheer force of law and bayonets, from plundering and burning houses, destroying mills and harvests, outraging and murdering helpless noncombatants, and deliberately devoting a whole city to bloodshed and flames. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> But let us not do injustice to those savages of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> who were the illustrious predecessors of the <name>Yanks</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>If they were fierce in battle and unforgiving in revenge, if they destroyed private property and made war upon helpless womanhood and infancy, it must be remembered that they never set themselves up as models of honest and religious deportment, had never heard the name of Christianity except as the religion of their white enemies, and never knew the advantages of universal education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>With all their sins they had some redeeming virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>If they were vindictive in their animosities they were faithful in their friendships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>If they were furious in battle, they were as brave as they were bloody, and could endure with unshrinking fortitude in their own persons the tortures they inflicted upon others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>There could be no greater contrast in the world than the whining and abject <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> in his hour of discomfiture and disaster, and the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> singing his death chant amid the flames of the stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Moreover the souls of the <name>Aborigines</name> were not absorbed in the pursuit of dollars and cents.
