<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>I know the advance of the army did arrive at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> at the proper time, but there was no pontoon train to meet it there, and in consequence of that the army could not cross at the time we expected to cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We were, therefore, delayed several days in consequence of the delay in the arrival of the pontoon train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>After arriving here we accumulated provisions for <measure n="12days" type="date">twelve days</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I think, of all the <rs>Generals</rs> present, that if the river could be crossed it ought to be crossed, no matter what might happen afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The point of crossing was not then definitely determined upon, but I thought at the time we were to cross several miss further down &mdash; Afterwards <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> called us together again, and informed us that he had determined to cross at the <num value="2">two</num> points at which we finally did cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I had no objection to that, but thought they were as good as the point further down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>I know nothing at all, in fact, about the defences on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It was not my business to know anything about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I think the arrangements for the crossing were all well made; at the same time I doubted our power to cross, and I do not believe we could have crossed had the enemy chosen to prevent it. And I know from what I have since seen, and what I before suspected, that they could have prevented our crossing at those <num value="2">two</num> points if they had chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>However, as the committee know that the crossing was successfully made under cover of a fog, and as far as my wing was concerned, we got into position safely with the loss of a very few men. Still we were in such a position that if the enemy had any moment opened upon us with the guns they had bearing upon us, I think that in the course of an hour our men would have been so scattered that it would have been impossible to rally them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>For some unaccountable reason they did not open their batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th inst.</day></dateStruct> I made an attack according to the order of <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>I put in all the troops that I thought it proper and prudent to put in. I fought the whole strength of my command as far as I could, and at the same time kept my communication with the river open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The reason that we failed was that we had not troops enough to carry the points where the attack was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Under the orders that were given, after we were pressed back, I directed that a position should be held as far in advance as was possible to had it, and I brought up all the troops in reserve to hold that position; I held that position until I was ordered to recross the river, and from what I threw of our want of success on the right, and of the demoralized condition of the troops on the right and centre, as represented to me by their commanders, confess that I believe the order to recross was a very proper <num value="1">one</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> Answer.--The probable result would have been that the army as much of it as <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> supposed was necessary, would have immediately crossed the river, driving away the enemy here, perhaps <num value="500">five hundred</num> or <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men, and they would have occupied the very heights which we have since been obliged to attack; and that crossing would have been permanent and successful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> Question &mdash; Do you know on whom rests the responsibility of the delay in the arrival of the pontoons? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> Answer.--I do not, officially. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Question.--What, in your opinion, is the number of your killed, wounded, and missing? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> Answer.--I think it will amount to about <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>, altogether. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> Question &mdash; Have you any knowledge of the less of the enemy? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> Answer &mdash; I have not, except what I saw incidentally in a Richmond paper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> Question.--Do I understand you to say that you concurred in the movement to cross the river? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Answer &mdash; It was not my opinion that we could cross at any of the points indicated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Question.--Will you state whether or not it is your opinion that if the movement of the army from <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> had been delayed until the time the pontoons arrived here the army could have then come here, and with those pontoons have made a crossing here and occupied the <rs type="place">Heights</rs> before the enemy could have reached here in sufficient force to have prevented it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Answer.--Yes, sir, that is my opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> Question.--Then it is your opinion that if it had been ascertained that the pontoons could not possibly be here at the time <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> expected them to be here, he should have been notified of the time when they could be here, so that he might make the movements of his army correspond with the time when the pontoons could be here? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> Answer.--That is my opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> Question.--What is the condition of the army now as to its efficiency?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Is its efficiency impaired, other than by the loss of so many men, or is it demoralized by the recent disasters? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> Answer &mdash; I think it is not demoralized at all; that is, so far as my own wing is concerned, I know it is not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> Question.--After the crossing had been made was it possible, in your opinion, for our troops to have carried the heights, or to have held our position upon the other side so as to have derived any advantage from it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> Answer.--It is my opinion that if, instead of making <num value="2">two</num> real attacks, our whole force had been concentrated on our left &mdash; that is, our available forces &mdash; and the real attack had been made there, and merely a feint made upon the right, we might have carried the heights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>I think we could have carried them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Whether the army would have achieved a success by that I cannot say. I do not mean to say that the mere carrying of the heights would have secured our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I do not know what was behind them, or how much of a force the enemy had there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I know that wherever we appeared we found a great many more then than we had. I would like to impress as firmly upon the committee as it is impressed upon my mind, the fact that the whole disaster has resulted from the delay in the arrival of the pontoon bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Whoever is responsible for the delay is responsible for all the disasters which have followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>We were rather astonished when we came down here to find that <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> had been here for some days and had not received the pontoon bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>I think that is the main cause for this disaster. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> Question.--Do you know what the expectation was as to the pontoons being here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>On the arrival of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">first army corps</orgName> that would get here, was it expected that the pontoons would be here? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> Answer.--Certainly, it was expected they would be here. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> Question.--What was that corps to have done if pontoons had been here? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> Answer.--That corps was to have crossed at once and taken possession of the heights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>If the pontoons had been here there would have been very little difficulty in doing that. </p>
