<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>As the little Confederate bantam lies in the pit, &#x0022;its back to the earth and its face to the sky, &#x0022; the great, big, unconquerable roosters, gobblers, eagles, vultures, and birds of every race, who have at last brought down the game little chicken, rend the air with their triumphant cries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They crowd round the diminutive carcase, turn it over and rip it open to see what it has got in its crop, and generally agree that such a terrifically sublime achievement as the subjugation of that small bird was unparalleled in war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> A Northern journal, somewhat envious of the glory which the diminutive seaport of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> has obtained, endeavors to detract from its merits by saying that the fortifications which have enabled it to hold out so long were originally constructed by the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If that were true, it does not much help the matter, for the strongest of those fortifications (<placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>) was taken by <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> in a few hours, whereas the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> required <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> to retake it; and could not have taken it then, and never could have taken it, but for the evacuation of the city, in consequence of the unobstructed march of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> through <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6199" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Not only <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, but the whole <rs>South</rs>, was taken a good many years ago, and to some purpose, when tariffs, coasting laws and bounties rendered every slaveholding State tributary to Northern manufacture and commerce; when Northern industry supplied every article of clothing, of <rs n="household furniture" type="product">household furniture</rs>, every agricultural implement in the <rs>South</rs>; when Northern books, Northern literature and Northern theology wielded the sceptre over our minds and souls. --Whether it is a good bargain to exchange such an occupation as that for the dominion of brute force, we leave it to Northern ingenuity to calculate when its passions have cooled down sufficiently to allow it to work out the sum. We are inclined to think that, even if successful in arms, it could never compel from a subjugated people, the returns which are chiefly yielded by a contented and hopeful population. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> All history has shown that the nation with most slaves in ancient times was, <foreign lang="lat"> <hi rend="italics">ceteris parabus,</hi></foreign> the most powerful in war, and it is the remark of <num value="1">one</num> of the best <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> students of antiquity that if there had been a State in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> without slaves, the probability is, it would quickly have been overthrown by the neighboring slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We find, in the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jewish</rs> system, slavery formally established by a Divine decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Long before the foundation of that system, we find the patriarch <rs>Abraham</rs> going to <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> battle with a force of slaves, which the <name>Scriptures</name> inform us were &#x0022;born in his house and bought with his money.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The <rs>Egyptians</rs> held slaves, as their monuments prove, and many of these slaves were negroes, as is clear from the representations on the royal sepulchres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <rs>Greeks</rs> held vast numbers at the time of their greatest strength, and each nation in proportion to its powers in war. <placeName reg="Sparta, Hancock, Georgia" key="tgn,2024380">Sparta</placeName> had <num value="8">eight</num> slaves to <num value="1">one</num> freeman, and <placeName reg="Athens, Clarke, Georgia" key="tgn,7013329">Athens</placeName> nearly as many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The slaves of these nations greatly aided in their splendid conquests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At Pataca <num value="5000">five thousand</num> <rs n="Spartan" type="ethnic">Spartans</rs> were attended by <num value="35000">thirty- five thousand</num> Helots as light troops. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Slavery increased <hi rend="italics">pari passu</hi> in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> with the greatness of that country until the number of slaves in and around <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> exceeded the freemen in the proportion of <num value="12">twelve</num> and <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Industrial pursuits were almost entirely intrusted to slaves and freedmen, and as the country advanced these were enrolled as soldiers and trained as gladiators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It was only with the disappearance of slavery that domination of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> over the rest of the world passed away; that her manners became corrupt, and she fell an easy prey to northern barbarians. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The question of Ocean Telegraphy, which has been for some time in abeyance, is undergoing at this time another attempt at solution by <name>British</name> enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Of the principles and manner on which this new effort is being made, we have little information in this blockaded region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It may not be uninteresting, in this connection, to give a brief sketch of ocean telegraphy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> In <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, an unsuccessful attempt was made to connect <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> by a submarine telegraph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A vessel bearing a copper wire inclosed in gutta-percha, intended for this purpose, started from <placeName reg="Dover, Strafford, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013613">Dover</placeName> and succeeded in paying out the wire and conveying the other end to the <rs>French</rs> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The printing instrument was attached, and several communications exchanged between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>; but the next morning communications ceased, and it was evident that the insulation was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It was found that the wire had been snapped asunder, constructed, as it was, without any power of resistance to the action of the waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The next year a more substantial cable was laid successfully.--This cable contained <num value="4">four</num> copper wires, each covered with gutta percha, so as to afford <num value="4">four</num> separate conductors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>These were twisted into a <num value="4">four</num>-strand rope, served round with tarred hemp and covered with strong galvanized iron wire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In the course of repairs afterwards, it appeared that the outer wires were in places corroded, especially where the cable lay on rocks, and was subject to attrition and exposed to the action of the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The extent of corrosion in different parts varied very much; for instance, the cable came up for a short length very good where it had lain in sand or mud, and also where it had got covered with shells, which, in some cases, made a coating of a couple of inches thick upon it &mdash; in places, on the other hand, where it was exposed to the water, it was almost entirely eaten away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Where the iron wires were loose and untwisted, so that the water could wash through them to the hemp, the yarn was rotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In other parts, where the hempen case was closely surrounded by the wire, and fully saturated with the tar, it was still in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The gutta percha covering the copper wires was in perfect condition. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>These lines were all comparatively short and in shallow water, but, in <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, the requirements of the war in the <name>Crimea</name> led to the construction of a line between <placeName key="tgn,7010109" n="1.000 1" reg="balaklava,krym,ukrayina,europe">Balaklava</placeName> and Varna, from which may be dated a new era in Ocean Telegraphy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>This line was <measure n="310miles" type="distance">three hundred and ten miles</measure> long, and served, to some extent, as a basis for ascertaining the law which governs the retardation of the electric current in long lines of submarine telegraph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The act of incorporation of this company was passed in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, and gave them, amongst other privileges, the exclusive right for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of landing cables on the shores of <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Labrador" key="tgn,7013071">Labrador</placeName>, without any conditions as to the time within which this right was to be exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It is believed that the disasters of the company are traceable to this pledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The cable was hastily constructed in order to be ready in time, and without the aid of carefully-devised experiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The break machinery was novel and cumbrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The whole thing was done in a hurry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Niagara</rs> and the <name n="United Kingdom">British</name> <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Agamemnon</rs> started together with the cable from <placeName reg="Valentine, Shelby, Ohio" key="tgn,2742121">Valentia</placeName> on the <date value="1857-08-07">7th of August, 1857,</date> with the intention of laying it across to <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>, in accordance with a plan which necessitated the junction of the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the cable in mid ocean as soon as <num value="1">one</num> vessel had paid out its cargo, whatever the weather might be. After paying out about <measure n="335miles" type="distance">three hundred and thirty-five miles</measure>, the cable broke on the <date value="08-11">11th of August</date> in <num value="2000">two thousand</num> fathoms of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The expedition then returned to <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> The vessels started again from Cork on the <date value="1858-07-17">17th of July, 1858,</date> and accomplished the laying of the cable between <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Valentine, Shelby, Ohio" key="tgn,2742121">Valentia</placeName> on the <date value="1858-08-05">5th of August, 1858,</date> with apparently complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>From the landing of the cable till <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> thereafter, mere indications of signals were received, although signals were being regularly sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>On the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">fifth</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time>, strong induction coils having been applied at <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>, the signals were easily read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> words were, &#x0022;Please repeat power.&#x0022;--The <rs>Queen</rs>'s message to the <rs>President</rs> occupied <measure n="16hours" type="date">sixteen hours</measure> in transmitting, which is explained by its having been stopped in the middle during some operations in the harbor of <placeName reg="Valentine, Shelby, Ohio" key="tgn,2742121">Valentia</placeName> and by the necessity of repeating parts over and over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The signals continued to be received &mdash; sometimes better, sometimes worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>They would suddenly show satisfactory indications for a time, then fail again; but they gradually became weaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The variations in the strength of the signals appeared to be due to the effect produced by the oxidation of the copper by means of the positive current at the place or places where the faults were situated, which oxidation gives an insulating covering to the wire, and to the clearing off of this covering from the copper when the negative currents were sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>On the <date value="10-20">20th of October,</date> a message was entered in the <name>Valentia</name> signal diary as being read thus: &#x0022;<num value="240">Two hundred and forty</num> tk-- -- (? <num value="2">two</num>) <persName n="Daniell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Daniell,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniell</surname></persName>'s now in circuit.&#x0022; That was the reading as entered in the <name>Valentia</name> diary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The message really sent <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> was: &#x0022;<num value="240">Two hundred and forty</num> trays, and <num value="72">seventy-two</num> liquid <persName n="Daniell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Daniell,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniell</surname></persName>'s now in circuit. &#x0022; So that the word that could not be made out was &#x0022;trays&#x0022;; that was the last effort of the cable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Attempts have subsequently been made to repair it, but the decay, from rust, of the outer covering, which consists of strands of very fine wires, has prevented the possibility of raising the cable without breaking it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> The failure was believed to be, in a great measure, owing to the absence of a proper preliminary experimental inquiry into the conditions required in the construction of such a cable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>But the more immediate causes of failure alleged are: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the absence of sufficient care in the manufacture of the cable from the limited time allowed for its completion; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the injury that the cable received by repeated handling between the time when it was constructed and the time it was laid; <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, the insufficient protection of the outer covering against corrosion; <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, the insufficient size of the conductor, and of its insulating covering in proportion to the length of the cable &mdash; a want which necessitated the use of high battery power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> With the lights thrown upon it by former experiments, the present <name>British</name> enterprise bids fair to be more successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>If so, it will be the crowning triumph of the wonderful mechanical genius of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which has, within the last <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure>, changed the whole face of society; which perfected the steam engine, and gave to man a motive force that has traversed the waters against winds and tides; buried him over the land at <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure> an hour, drawn up the treasures of the deepest mine, and helped the power loom and the spinning jenny to clothe the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> Fellow Citizens: The shattered condition of my health, with my advanced age, considerably transcending the <num value="3">three</num>-score years and <num value="10">ten</num> allotted to man, having disqualified me for the discharge of the representative duties which you did me the honor, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, by an unsolicited choice, to confide to me, I feel constrained, by a sense of duty and propriety, to resign into your hands the trust I then received from you, and which I am now physically incapable of executing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>I have honestly and faithfully endeavored to serve you, according to the measure of my ability; but, as I apprehended when you called me from my retirement, my strength and constitution have utterly sunk under the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>For the last <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> I have been confined to my bed by a severe and complicated illness; and the consequence has been, much to my chagrin and regret, that you have been unrepresented in Congress upon some of the most important questions which have occupied the attention of that body during its present session. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> At my time of life, and with the shock already received from repeated attacks of disease, brought on in the public service during the last <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, I have no right to expect, whatever may be the result of my present illness, that in the future I shall be better able to serve you than at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Your interests, and the interests of the great cause in which we are engaged, are of too important a character to be committed to so precarious and feeble a guardianship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The labors of the present session of Congress drawing to a close, and the period of the general State elections being now at hand, when my place can be supplied without putting you to the trouble of a special election, I have thought the moment most suitable for resigning into your hands, as I now do, the remnant of my representative term. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Besides the grateful recollection I shall always cherish of the confidence and encouragement with which you have sustained me through a long career of public service, we shall still be bound together by common sentiments and common interests in the future as in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>My constant prayers shall be addressed to heaven to make that future as propitious and glorious as heart can wish.
