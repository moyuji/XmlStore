<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The alliance formed between <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, the object of which is to oblige <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> to pay her just debts, will compel the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> either to abandon the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine altogether, or to take a decided stand against the allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>It is true, that the allies, or at least the <orgName n="London Post" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Post</hi></orgName>, which is the organ of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, </hi> declare that they do not intend to land in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>; that their operations are to be confined to the sea and the harbors; that they mean to blockade the latter, and assemble a large fleet in the gulf, for the purpose off enforcing the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>With great deference to the better judgment of the <hi rend="italics">Post,</hi> we see not how the proposed object can be accomplished by the proposed measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>To us it seems very like the ancient policy of the debtor, who, as long as the law allowed him, locked up his insolvent creditor in jail, thereby insuring the absolute impossibility of his ever receiving his debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Nor will the proposed plan of taking possession of the ports, and themselves collecting the revenues, answer any better purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Such an arrangement is not possible as long as the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government is allowed to exist, or rather, we should say, such an arrangement must inevitably defeat its own object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>It is possible that the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government might consent to the installation of the allies as collectors of the revenue; but if the present <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government at all resembles any Government that <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> ever had since she broke of her connection with <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, it will none the less be certain to collect a new set of duties upon the goods when once landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>And should the allies interfere to prevent the collection of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> set of duties, they must end by planting their standards upon the steeple of the <rs type="place">Grand Cathedral</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Intervention in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> means, in plain terms, the conquest of <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>It may be that this <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> imbroglio will lead to the opening of our ports, but we do not think it will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>It was not until subsequent events proved it, that the officer discovered he had turned loose <num value="1">one</num> of the convicts &mdash; the very worst <num value="1">one</num> of the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>After the other <num value="2">two</num> were lodged in jail, search was made for the <num value="1">one</num> at large until <time value="12am">midnight</time>, and continued all day yesterday, but with no success up to late last evening. </p>

<head>[they were brought to this city yesterday.]<lb/>the <name>System</name> of Free markets.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/> The establishment of free markets in many of the cities <rs>South</rs> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, for the benefit of those who are not able to purchase the comforts and necessaries of life, is truly an admirable forethought in times like the present, and <num value="1">one</num> which we hope the enterprising and patriotic citizens of this locality will not be long in emulating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The following excellent and considerate suggestion is taken from the <placeName reg="Saint Joseph, Tensas, Louisiana" key="tgn,2043930">St. Joseph (Tensas parish</placeName>,) <hi rend="italics">Gazette.</hi> Cannot some such plan be adopted in this city?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>We have no doubt, if the recommendation of the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi> were generally agreed to, there are <num value="1000">thousands</num> whose contributions would not be stinted to the limit named by that journal; but even with a dime from each voter the aggregate would make a handsome sum: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> There never was an institution which, during the pressing times of a people, has been productive of so much good as the <rs type="place">Free Market</rs> in New Orleans is bestowing upon the distressed families of the volunteers, who have left that city for the war. As the winter approaches, vegetables will be less abundant, and apart from the stables, fuel will have to be supplied to the poor families, whom we cannot allow to be exposed to the cold blasts of the season, so that it must be clear to every <num value="1">one</num> that soon more contributions will be required than even now. It is true that the liberality of our citizens has been taxed in very many respects, that every <num value="1">one</num> is doing all he can for the good cause, and that there may be some who disagree with us as to the asking of assistance for the poor in the city when there is so much to be attended to at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>However, what we ask is very little and we doubt not will be attended to without a single exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>We suggest that at the coming <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> elections, contribution boxes he placed at all the polls wherein such man can deposit a dime for the benefit of the <rs type="place">Free Market</rs> in New Orleans-- There is not a man who will not be able and willing to contribute that much, and if the press throughout the <rs>State</rs> will only urge this matter, or our authorities publish such a <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> request, several <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> will be easily raised, which sum will go far to relieve the suffering of many destitute families. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Plain Mr. H., too, has enlisted as a high private.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/> We recommend the following paragraph which we clip from the <orgName n="Savannah Republican" type="newspaper">Savannah <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi></orgName>, to those whom it may concern in this city.--We respectfully suggest to our patriotic landlords, that (perhaps) the same reasons which dictated the propriety of a reduction of rents in our sister cities South of us, exist to us great an extent here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Has there been an instance of such a course being pursued by any <num value="1">one</num> of them? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/> Many of our landlords have acted most nobly towards their tenants in these times of trouble, when business is completely at a stand still, and the latter are unable to pay. Some have reduced their rent <num value="20">20</num>, some <num value="25">25</num>, and others <num value="0.33">33 per cent.</num>, in consideration of the great falling-off in business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>In some instances parties are required to pay what they conveniently can, and give their notes for the balance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> A few hard cases &mdash; men who cannot brook the idea of a curtailed revenue, or of abridging any of their luxuries in the midst of general distress, still hold out and claim the uttermost farthing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Of these, though, we hope there are but few, and that even they, upon a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought, will consent to make their share of sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>They may make less money, but they curtail nothing of the comforts of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>They will still be able to live and live well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>The real suffering in times like these, is with that class who labor for their daily bread, whose wages are necessary for their subsistence, and who have to struggle with diminished receipts and high prices combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>There are many such and the war has aggravated the evil by drawing the support of many poor families to the tented field. </p> </div4>
