<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Since my last letter the people of this city have been so profoundly exercised on the question of the river defence and the <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName>, that I have not been able to devote the usual time to keep you posted on the events and occurrences transpiring in our neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Batteries are being rapidly placed in position on <placeName reg="Tybee Island, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2462056">Tybee Island</placeName> by the <rs>Federals</rs>, and on all points in the neighborhood affording a chance to reach the <rs>Fort</rs>.--<placeName reg="Mortan batteries">Mortan batteries</placeName> mounting heavy pieces, some believed by <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> to be of unusual weight and calibre, (I have been told by <num value="1">one</num> who conversed with him that he does not doubt that <measure n="20inch" type="distance">twenty-inch</measure> mortars are in possession of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>,) and further, the continual and steady advance and occupation of these points seem to show a determination on their part to make the attack on the fort before long. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> It may be said that Pulacki is completely invested, and though the distance is great yet they have the means of reaching a greater range by their improved ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Some shots fired at the fort have passed over it, and near half a mile beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The fort is well protected and the garrison is composed of men who will not be found wanting when the time of trial comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I believe it capable of resisting or rather enduring such a bombardment successfully, but the besieged must be greatly harassed and annoyed by their continual fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We have not been altogether without some little episodes in the campaign about here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Although is would be difficult to rival the adventurous during of <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,John,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, we have the right spirit, and, of late, a terribly annoying and desultory style of warfare has been kept up on our foes, which they will find more harassing and troublesome and more difficult to repel than any other means hitherto adopted against them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> In <placeName reg="Florida, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> met with a disaster, losing a large number out of their force landed, and <measure n="4" type="killed">four killed</measure> in the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It was a most gallant exploit, and if we could obtain any really correct report of the affair, would be worthy of any amount of repetition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They compelled the officer in command of the gunboat to release <num value="7">seven</num> negroes stolen by them before the privilege of burying their dead had been accorded, and finally they gave to the gallows the negro fellow who piloted them in. In <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> they captured a party of Lincolnites, belonging to a Pennsylvania regiment, which, after having refused to yield, had <measure n="1" type="killed">one killed</measure> and <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure>, though discretion the better part of valor and succumbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><placeName reg="Edisto Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,1007009">Edisto Island</placeName>, on which they were captured, is a kind of debatable ground, and the large force which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> maintain there, proves the daring and courage of those who assail their pickets within such easy distance of their camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We had thought that the times were not propitious for like enterprisesoin <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, but no sooner had the idea crossed my mind than the <orgName type="regiment" key="13GARegiment">13th Georgia regiment</orgName> proves it unwarranted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Yesterday a scouting party from that regiment passed from <placeName key="tgn,2767946" n="1.000 2" reg="whitemarsh island, chatham, georgia">Whitemarsh</placeName> across to <placeName reg="Wilmington Island, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2024736">Wilmington Island</placeName>, and fortunately came up with a load of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, whom they soon disposed of satisfactorily, having <measure n="1" type="killed">killed one</measure>, mortally <measure n="2" type="wounded">wounded two</measure>, and <measure n="18" type="captured">captured eighteen</measure>, together with their barge and a <measure n="6l." type="pounds"><num value="6">six</num> pound</measure> bronze gun. The enemy will become so wary after a while I fear our boys will not be able to approach them within good rifle distance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> There have been many reports afloat about the city relative to an attack on <placeName reg="Fort Pulasid">Fort Pulasid</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I have already mentioned my source of information, but am not aware that <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> has any certain means of acquiring a knowledge of the movements of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, except from his more extended and accurate field of observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is certain that a recently captured <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs>, belonging to the <orgName type="regiment" key="48NYRegiment">48th New York regiment</orgName>, had a letter about him not finished, but intended for his wife in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, stating that on <name>Friday</name> next <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName> would be attacked, also detailing the proposed campaign from its successful bombardment, the immediate advance upon and capture of the city, and the equally brilliant and sudden occupation of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>How much credit is to be attached to these rumore I am unable to say, but I am not inclined to place confidence upon any such ratiocinations, for they have no more substantial foundation when the day and hour is assigned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Heavy guns were heard during this forenoon but it is not yet known whence it proceeded; it was thought that it came from <placeName reg="Causten's Bluff">Causten's Bluff</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The debate in Congress some time since, and the resolution offered relative to the withdrawal of our Ministers at foreign Courts, and the notification of the cessation of all authority under their old exequators received from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, has drawn subjugation to the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>People begin to appreciate the position that <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> occupy in regard to us, and the motive for their inaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Our pride demands that these officials, who really possess no authority, should not longer be allowed to assume it, and to act upon it, in many cases to the detriment of our cause and interference with our internal regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They have granted to many, in different parts of the country, a claim to <name>British</name> protection who have for years resided in our midet, claimed the right of suffrage, and even held offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I cannot speak of such renegades, who put off their allegiance, and with it their honor, as they would an old garment; but the means of accomplishing it should be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Why should we respect an authority that does not show us the respect which is due. <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> come over and accumulate massive fortunes, dwell among us, receive the protection of our laws, and in the time of trial deny the sligh test service which is demanded of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Is this to be endured with patience?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We would not institute a <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> code, but we can require all those who are not with us to leave the country, in conformity with the usage of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>There are not wanting instances of protection being granted to men born within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> on the simple oath of the party demanding it, while abundant evidence might be produced of the place of his nativity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Let the <rs>Government</rs> act with the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We seek no longer foreign interference with either the blockade or the war. Let <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> understand we care not how long they defer the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> On <date>Thursday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="3">3d</day></dateStruct>, a new draft will be called for from <placeName reg="Chatham, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000316">Chatham county</placeName>, that of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> ult, not having been filled to the required member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If it shall be conducted fairly and impartially few will complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>As the last stood, none but the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> were drafted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> <persName n="Walker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Walker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> has been extremely ill for a week past, from an attack of pneumonia, but I am glad to add that be is reported convalescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The loss of <num value="1">one</num> so well known, and whose services deserve so much honor from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, would be a servere blow to the <rs>State</rs>, but <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> kindly extends protection in our need over all our heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Should no change take place, we trust soon to see the <rs>General</rs> again at the head of his brigade, ready to lead where &#x0022;glory waits him&#x0022;--the battlefield. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> I am in receipt of a letter from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, is which I am advised of the successful evasion of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The writer thinks the enterprising beads that carry out this adventurous business, deserve the thanks of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and are, indeed, public benefactors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> We are getting quite alarmed here about provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Our markets are in a most desperately collapsed state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Butter is nearly impossible to obtain at <measure n="75cents" type="currency">75 cents</measure> per lb., and every other commodity is becoming scarce.
