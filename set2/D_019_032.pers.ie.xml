<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> A thin shawl may be made warm by folding a newspaper inside of it. The paper is impervious to the wind and cold air from outside, and prevents the rapid escape of the warm air beneath it. Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that the heat of the body is carried off much more rapidly in a high wind than in a calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The wind blows away the heat evolved from the body; but in a perfectly still air this heat remains, and constitutes an atmospheric envelope so nearly of the same temperature with the body itself, that the latter is not so quickly robbed of its natural heat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> There are some very interesting facts about the body in power to make and contain heat, which are familiar to all, when told, but which are seldom thought of in daily experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>For example, the body will hold a great deal more heat than it gets from its own furnaces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The stomach is a furnace, and our food is the fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>It keeps up a uniform temperature in the blood equal to about <num value="98">98</num> degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>If the stomach could consume food fast enough to maintain that heat, the body could not be frozen by any extreme of cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>But in proportion to the severity of cold to which the body is exposed, is the rapidity with which it looses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Some substances taken into the stomach make a hot blaze much sooner than others, as brandy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>To put brandy in the stomach is like putting pitch under a steam boiler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It soon burns out, and the greater heat injures the furnace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> We say that the body will hold more heat than it gets from its own furnaces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Heat is measured by degrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>On going out of a warm room, the body will immediately begin to lose its heat, and it must part with a certain number of degrees before it can begin to feel cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The direction has sometimes been given--<q>&#x0022;Don't hug the stove, if you are going to set out on a cold journey.&#x0022;</q> But experience says do hug it. Get in as many degrees of heat as you can carry, if it is <num value="500">500</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Then wrap yourself up well, and you can economize these <num value="500">500</num> degrees through a long ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>But if you had only taken <num value="100">100</num> degrees at the start, they would have been exhausted mid-way of the journey, and then you would have begun to feel cold. --Nevertheless, it is an unhealthy habit to accustom <num value="1">one</num>'s self on ordinary occasions to more heat than is actually needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>This is a very common fault, and bears on the pocket as well as on the health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The extremities of the body get cold <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, often to a painful degree, while the trunk is warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>But so long as the trunk keeps warm, in a person of common, vigorous health, there is little fear of &#x0022;catching cold&#x0022; by aching toes or fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>In rail-car riding, it is much safer to let the toes ache, than to allow the lungs to feed on the foul air around the stove. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> When you set out on a winter journey, if you are liable to suffer from cold toes, which many people do in spite of &#x0022;rubbers,&#x0022; fold a piece of newspaper over your stocking, which you can readily do, if your boots or shoes are not irrationally tight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>This is better than &#x0022;rubbers,&#x0022; which are, in fact, very cold comforters in extreme, while they make the feet sweat in moderate weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The main use of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> rubber overshoes is to keep out water, and for that they are <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only to a stout, water-proof, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate, calf-skin boot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>There is not a more villainously unwholesome article of wear made than the high topped rubber boot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> Although the body can take in a greater number of degrees of heat than it gets from its own furnace, the stomach, yet its capacity is limited in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>For example, when the hand is warm you cannot hold it in the air of a hot oven for a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>; but when it is cold, and especially when damp, also, you may hold it there for sometime without being obliged to withdraw it. And so of the whole body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It appears that the body may carry less, as well as more heat, than the quantity supplied by its own furnace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Its extremities and its surface often become painfully cold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> In winter, a traveler occasionally finds in a hotel a deficiency of bed covering: or in the sensitiveness of disease, he may require more than in health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The newspaper for which he paid <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure> on the cars, spread under the upper cover, will be equal to an additional blanket. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> A piece of silk <rs n="oil cloth" type="product">oil cloth</rs>, stitched in the folds of a shawl, is more flexible than the paper, and will last a whole winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It has the advantage of securing inward warmth without the additional weight of a thicker garment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> The constitutional vivacity and temper of a person has much to do with his endurance of cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>For this vivacity is a sort of nervous fire that lessens the sensibility to outward impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>An indifferent, milk-and-water person, without energy and force, is at the mercy of every cold blast that sweeps round the corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He, and especially <hi rend="italics">she,</hi> has no defence but to wear a dozen shawls during the day, and sleep under a bale of blankets at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The relation of master and slave, and the claim of property involved in it, are either just and honorable, or unjust and base; and hence I see no other way to adjust the differences that exist in reference to this phase of the subject than to induce men to examine and decide on rational grounds the right or wrong of the question, before they attempt to heal the exacerbations that grow out of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/> &#x0022;The decision to which i am brought on this point by an investigation, as careful as I am capable of making, is adverse to the general sentiment in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Slavery at the <rs>South</rs> is an immovable fact, accepted at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> from necessity, and cherished now (as its patrons tell us, and I readily believe them,) from conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The love of country, therefore, the love of peace, the love of liberty for ourselves, our posterity, and for all nations, no less than the love of truth, should persuade us to lay aside the bias of party, our prepossessions in favor of great names, and all our prejudices, that we may calmly and candidly review a subject which, in the present crisis of affairs, involves more momentous interests than any other of a worldly nature that can occupy our attention.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Dr. Seabury's"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<head>Members of the <rs>Convention</rs> &mdash; their classification.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/> Much embarrassment has arising as to the proper classification of the members of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Several instances have occurred already in which we know the classifications adopted are unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>In the great majority of cases there is really no difference in principle between those who are called &#x0022;Union men&#x0022; and those who are styled &#x0022;Secessionists.&#x0022; --The latter are, perhaps, warmer in their declarations than the former, and more positive in their specification of the time for definitive action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The former favor a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, and do not limit themselves as to time; yet, they indicate very clearly that the troubles of the sections must be settled before the discussion is ended, and must be settled satisfactorily and honorably to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Both would be glad if the old Union could be restored on such a basis; but <num value="1">one</num> is a little more patient than the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>The more patient are not red-hot, but warm enough for all practical purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>We have, therefore, selected as, perhaps, the best mode of classifying the members elect the terms &#x0022;Prompt Action&#x0022; and &#x0022;Conservative.&#x0022; These phrases will not convey the proper idea, but we can hit upon none better. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/> Although nothing new, this system of warfare could be better applied.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/> My proposition in regard to fortifications, is the extending of a line of cast-iron pipes along the outside of the ramparts, with short rubes like unto enlarged gas burners placed <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> apart, and screwed into the main pipes with apertures similar to fish-tall burners, so as to throw the streams in opposite directions, each stream crossing the other, care being taken that the tubes be turned slightly from the ramparts, so as to eject the streams outwardly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>In this manner a constant sheen of scalding water could be poured into the ranks of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>At certain distances &mdash; say, <num value="30">30</num> or <measure n="40feet" type="distance">40 feet</measure>--valves should be inserted, which by a simple movement would turn off or on the water, according to the section of pipe at which the attack would be made.--Large steam boilers, with the requisite applications of steam-pumps, pipes, valves and gauges, to keep up the supply of water and steam &mdash; well secured from the shot and shell of the enemy &mdash; placed at convenient intervals along the batteries inside, make up a whole of <num value="1">one</num> of the most formidable styles of defence now before the military world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>Over the ceiling of the gateways, inside the gates, as many large pipes, the same size of those for the ramparts, <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> in diameter, should be adjusted as near together as could be done conveniently, with its tubes inverted, so that in event the gates should yield to the besiegers a shower of scalding water and steam would send its death-dealing powers upon the contending forces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/> In reference to vessels-of-war, particularly steamers, it could be most easily and successfully employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>I would in that case propose the extension of a belt, as it were, of pipe, from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> in diameter, around the entire hull, outside, at a proper distance from the water, fitted with short tubes, as in the case of the fortification, the supply operated upon by means of stop valves from the inside, at the spot or section it should be required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>The degree of force necessary to throw the water is always at hand in steamers arranged with the modern improvements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>I give these propositions to you for what they are worth, fully convinced in my own mind, however, that were I employed in the construction of works of defence, or ships of war, I would unhesitatingly advocate the adoption of these ideas of resistance by hot water. </p> <closer> <signed>W.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>Left an orphan in early girlhood, she had inherited little from her <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> father beyond a certain graceful singularity of aspect, an earnest, thoughtful temperament, and a devoted love of art. Her <name>English</name> mother had tried hard to counteract this last, but the natural bias was too strong; and when this anxious but uncongenial parent was laid by her husband's side in the dismal city cemetery, and the young girl found herself alone with a few <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> for her sole fortune, she resolved neither to eke out her means by giving lessons to young children, as <persName n="Hanusmann,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.01078" reg="mostcommon:Hanusmann,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hanusmann</surname></persName> had done during her widowhood, nor to seek her <name>English</name> relations &mdash; cold and formal people, who offered the orphan a home, indeed, but had never forgiven her mother's runaway match &mdash; but at once to devote a portion of her little all to obtaining the best instruction in her father's favorite branch of art, flower-painting, and then to throw herself upon it as a profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>Miniature-painting, it had been suggested to her, would be a more lucrative pursuit; but she felt that her real success would lie in the other direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>Hers was a passionate love for nature, especially for flowers, which were almost her only experience of nature in perfection; while, on the other hand, an indifference to, or even a shy shrinking from society, had been fostered by the circumstances of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>Her mother, a refined <name>English</name> woman &mdash; although she had stepped out of her own sphere when she followed the fortunes of the wandering artist, had never felt herself at home in any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>The little <rs>Lina</rs> had no childish playmates, the growing girl no youthful companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>Since she cannot associate with her equals, the mother had thought to herself, she is best alone; and so her favorite toys had been her father's old brushes and colors, and her chief diversion a stroll with him. Others might have looked on this as a dreary life; the grave, affectionate girl herself never remembered it as having been such while her father lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>She had been satisfied with the sense of happiness that came over her when he corrected a little and praised a great deal some juvenile effort of her pencil; or when, curled up upon his knee, in the gloom of a winter evening, he would tell her bright tales of skies and flowers, palaces and paintings of other lands; or sad tales of his own gentle <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> mother, who grew quite blind before her early death; or, better still, when, in his fine barytone voice, he would troll out for her some of the student-songs of his native <placeName key="tgn,7005177" n="1.000 1" reg="heidelberg,karlsruhe,baden-wurttemberg,deutschland,europe">Heidelberg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>After she lost him, there came indeed a period of gloom, but it was not long enough to depress her energies; and when she was left alone, the very strength of purpose necessary was abundant support, and her art itself abundant excitement, so that sitting there day by day in that dingy room, her whole soul absorbed in her work, the grave, earnest, singular-looking girl had been perhaps more enviable than many of her more prosperous sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>At the time our story begins, she was <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>, and the struggling part of her career seemed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Her master had told her, some time ago, that he could teach her nothing further; her pictures already commanded a ready sale; and their decided merit began to extort notice from the most oracular critics of the day. To all this she might have added no small degree of social success &mdash; for, besides that people began to remember here and there how well-born and well-connected the <rs type="role" reg="IsChild">mother of</rs> the successful young artist had been, her own graceful figure and rich control to voice would have insured her a welcome into many a gay circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>But <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName> was too shy or too proud to find any enjoyment there, and steadily declined all invitations; only sometimes, in the summer, she might be bribed by her love of wild flowers, ferns, &#x0026;c., to pay a country visit, and it was in the course of <num value="1">one</num> of these that she had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met <persName n="Blount,,Fred,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.01079" reg="default:Blount,Fred,,,"><foreName>Fred</foreName> <surname>Blount</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>A week spent together in a country house in the sweet summer season; a few long walks at the close of pleasant days, with nature enjoyed, sunsets watched, songs sung together, and they parted lovers in all but words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>They met again in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and that constantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>They had been engaged for a year before the fact transpired to horrify the town of <placeName reg="Pyneton">Pyneton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>How happy <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName> had during this year been, it would not be easy to say. Her intense nature fully awakened for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time &mdash; her intellect stimulated by a companionship more thoughtful and cultivated than she had over known &mdash; the cold sense of loneliness which had hung over her since she lost her father all dispelled, it would be no exaggeration to say that she enjoyed a present bliss, unalloyed alike by <num value="1">one</num> regret for the past, or <num value="1">one</num> fear for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/><persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> was happy, too, but his was a more checkered feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>Naturally of an anxious temper, he often suspected that he had done unwisely in choosing for a profession <num value="1">one</num> to which he could not give an undivided allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>Had he been &mdash; as he once expected to have been &mdash; a man of independent means, he would have lived a student's life, absorbed in certain abstruse speculations, which had, ever since his college-days, secretly possessed a strong attraction for him. Even as things were, he could not forego them altogether, and <persName n="Stephens,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.01080" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><surname>Stephens</surname></persName> and <persName n="Chitty,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.01081" reg="mostcommon:Chitty,nomatch:0"><surname>Chitty</surname></persName> would often be thrown aside for <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.01082" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName> and <rs type="role2">Cousin</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>In this direction, if in any, lay the path he could have trodden with self-satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>But what of that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>He was now a lawyer &mdash; had, if so it might be, to earn a living at the bar; and it behooved him more than ever to work hard in his uncongenial calling, for <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>'s sake as well as his own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/> Meanwhile, <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>'s favorite dream was, by the exercise of her own beloved art, to free him from this necessity; to secure for him so complete an independence of professional drudgery as would leave him free to follow the bent of his own inclination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>He had no prejudice, <milestone unit="colum" n="2"/> she knew, against an active career for woman; he would let her continue hers; and for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time there mingled with her desire for excellence, a keen appreciation of the wealth it would bring in its train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/><q>&#x0022;For him, for him,&#x0022;</q> she would murmur to herself, as she hung over some exquisitely delicate painting, and touched and retouched till her copy had the very texture as well as the hue of the flowers before her. <q>&#x0022;It is not fitting that he should be poor &mdash; his life and mine have been so differently spent: he has all the tastes of the man of family and fortune; I, the artist's daughter, used to struggle from my childhood &mdash; I do not share, but it will be my joy to minister to these.&#x0022;</q> And so she would sit and dream, white the fairy fronds of some delicate fern, or the down on the stalk of some fragile wild-flower, grew beneath her fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>But of late weeks she would sometimes stop to close her large blue eyes, strained as they felt by the over-intentness of their gaze, or to press her hand over her forehead, which sometimes quivered with a sudden and darting pain, which she would not mention to <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> (reliant by nature, she had become more so by much living alone,) neither would she give into it, for the picture before her must be finished by the approaching Exhibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>It would sell, she calculated, for a considerable sum; other commissions would probably follow; and then &mdash; and then &mdash; She was so deep in her happy reverie <num value="1">one</num> day, that <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> actually entered the room unnoticed, and exclaimed at her paleness, and at the weary look in her sweet eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>But as he kissed them, their light returned, and the color rushed so richly into her cheek, that he began to think his impression had been indeed <q>&#x0022;all fancy,&#x0022;</q> as she declared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/> <q>&#x0022;But you must promise me not to overwork yourself in my absence, my <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>,&#x0022;</q> he said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/> <q>&#x0022;In your absence!&#x0022;</q> she replied, in a voice of dismay, for it was their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/> <q>&#x0022;Yes; I have had heavy tidings to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>My good old uncle, <persName n="Barlow,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.01083" reg="mostcommon:Barlow,nomatch:0"><surname>Barlow</surname></persName>, is ill, and alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>You know how much I owe to his kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>I cannot refuse to go to him, even though I leave my <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>But it will not be for long &mdash; I could not stand that.&#x0022;</q> Then turning to her picture: <q>&#x0022;What an exquisite group this is!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>How tender, how minute!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>Why, it makes my eyes ache to look at your microscopic touches, my fairy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>But come out with me now, and let us have a walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>I half suspect you work too hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>I declare I'm jealous of your art, <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>.&#x0022; </q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/> <q>&#x0022;You need not,&#x0022;</q> she said, with a smile so bright that no <num value="1">one</num> could have guessed how violent the pain that shot through her forehead and eyes as she spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>She had been over working, perhaps; but she was not going to tell him of this &mdash; and so spoil utterly his last walk with her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/> The evening was gloomy and chill; the shadow of their parting hung on the spirits of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>Whatever subject they took up led into a vein of sadness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/><persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName> did not know why, but she spent the greater part of the night in tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>When morning came, her eyes were so red and heavy, she was almost glad <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> would not see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>She must work hard, she said, to overcome this singular depression; and she <hi rend="italics">did</hi> work hard, though at times a strange dimness crept over her sight, and her hand was oftener pressed to her throbbing forehead than it had ever been before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day there came a letter from <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>, so long and loving that it half reconciled her to his absence, half increased her yearning for his return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>He had found his uncle worse than he expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>There was to be a consultation on the morrow; his next letter would give the result, and fix the day of his return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>Another day of continuous painting, of more pain to contend with, of strange flashes of light alternating with that occasional dimness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>She would rest her eyes, she resolved, as soon as she got <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>'s next letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>She could bear inaction with his return to look forward to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/> Alas! the letter, when it comes, does not fix his return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>A short sea-voyage is pronounced the only hope in his uncle's case; a friend has placed his yacht at his disposal; he will not make the experiment alone, but if <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> will accompany him, consents to try the effect of a short cruise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>It would be unkind, ungrateful to deny the old man's request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>A month at furthest will restore him to his <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>, and she will feel as he does, that there was no alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>O yes, she does feel it; he was right, right always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>His uncle has been a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>Had she been well, the brave-hearted woman would have acquiesced cheerfully; but as it was, she could not conquer her sadness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>She could not keep it back from him &mdash; write cheerfully this last letter that he could receive before the yacht sailed, and work the dismal time of separation away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>But when, having finished her letter, she went to her painting that morning, she found work impossible.--Large spots of red seemed to gather on the petals of the water-lilies she was copying; the pain in the eyeballs grew intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>Her heart beat thick and anxiously lest, if this went on, she might be obliged to give up her occupation for weeks or months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>Better to take prompt measures to have the tedium of repose now, that she might be quite well when <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>She went straightway to <num value="1">one</num> of the most celebrated oculists of the day. The sympathy of his manner, the minuteness of his questions, alarmed her; her energetic nature could bear anything better than suspense.--<q>&#x0022;Did <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs> W &mdash; fear blindness? &#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;He grieved to say he did.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Of what nature?&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Of the most hopeless &mdash; amaurosis.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/> Oh, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> all you upon whom there has never fallen some sudden shattering agony like this, who have had to give up the whole, hope of your life at an instant's notice &mdash; never had the glory and promise of the universe blotted from you by <num value="1">one</num> single word!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>And thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, too, when you stand by some fellow-creatures thus stricken, that such blows, when they do come, stun as well as torture, and that their very magnitude prevents for a season the sense of their reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>When the power of thinking returned, <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought was of <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>If this were indeed so; but no &mdash; it was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>At all events, it was well that his kind heart was not darkened with this horrible fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>A week &mdash; a fortnight passed; still, in spite of rest and remedial measures, the pain, the dimness, the flashes of light before the eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>And yet no <num value="1">one</num> looking into their blue depths could have seen anything beyond their beauty and their sadness, and in the heavy eyelids the trace of frequent tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>The doctor had indeed told her that, above all things, tears were injurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>Ah! he did not know how much she had to weep over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>Not only this art-world shut out from her, not only the loss of the pursuit that had been to her a passion, but the loss of love; for, as she lay there in her darkened room, <num value="1">one</num> thought, <num value="1">one</num> resolve grew clearer and stronger day by day; <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>'s career should not be hampered by a blind wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>She knew his noble, honorable nature well; knew that this great affliction fallen upon her would only make him hold his plighted word more sacred than before; that he would choose hard work of any kind, choose poverty even such as entailed loss of social station, choose any alternative rather than leave his poor sightless <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName> desolate and alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>But she knew, too, very well, that to a man of his sensitive poetical temperament and early formed habits, poverty would have a peculiar sting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>Then his own health was far from strong, and his spirits variable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>Better for him the sharp, sudden loos than the life-long burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>In the midst of her anguish, there came to the woman's heart the great strength of self-sacrifice--<hi rend="italics">better for him.</hi> These words nerved her for all. It was well, too, for her that at this terrible crisis she had to act as well as to suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>Sometimes, in her annoy to devise the measures by which this calamity should fall most lightly upon him, she for a while almost forgot her share in it. It often occurred to her that it would be best if, on his return, he should find her gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>But, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>the yearning for <num value="1">one</num> more look into the face she so loved before darkness fell upon her forever!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>Had he been with her when she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> heard that dreadful sentence, the impulse to tell him her wretchedness might have been too strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>She rejoiced that he was not. But now she thought she could trust herself to <num value="1">one</num> more meeting; at all events, she would make all her arrangements so as to be able to set off at a day's notice; but she would at least wait to hear of his safe return to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>Meanwhile, she employed her hours of ease, and of comparative clearness of vision, in modelling, from her most faithful memory, a bust of her lover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>She had often modelled before, but never with such singular success &mdash; she knew every lineament of this face <hi rend="italics">so</hi> well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>Her whole soul was in her work, for this bust would be all that she should save out of the wreck of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>This she would take with her into her banishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>Passing her hand thus over the high forehead, the heavy waves of hair, the regular features so familiar to her now, she could guard against the image in her heart ever becoming fainter. </p>
