<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday passed off with unusual quiet, scarcely a rumor having disturbed the current of the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We give below such news as we were enabled to gather: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>From the front.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> It appears that all the reports of the fight at <placeName reg="Riddle's Shop">Riddle's Shop</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, were incorrect, and that, instead of driving our troops, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were finally themselves driven by our infantry several miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>We still hold the <rs type="place">Malvern Heights</rs>, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,H.,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is reported to have gone to Wesfever, full <placeName><distance reg="30miles">thirty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName> by the road, in <placeName reg="Charles City, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002257">Charles City county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This is near the point to which <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> retreated after he was whipped away from the front of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The reports of the demoralization of the <rs>Federal</rs> army are apparently well grounded, and it may be that he has sought this locality which, under the protection of the gunboats, he can recuperate his shattered strength, and get the courage of his men up to the fighting point; though the more probable supposition is that he design is crossing to the <rs>Southside</rs>, somewhere in the vicinity of <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The enemy retreated in confusion, apparently, by the route he came, leaving his dead and wounded on the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> At daylight this morning, it was discovered that the <orgName>army of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Grant,H.,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName></orgName> had left our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our skirmishers were advanced between <num value="1">one</num> and <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, but failing to discover the enemy, were withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A body of cavalry and some infantry, from long Bridge, advanced to <persName n="Riddle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Riddle,nomatch:0"><surname>Riddle</surname></persName>'s shop and were driven back this evening nearly <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, after some sharp skirmishing. </p> <closer> <salute>Respectfully,</salute> <signed><persName n="Lee,,R.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Lee,R.,E.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName>  <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, General.</signed> </closer> </div5> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The enemy are still moving, it is supposed for the purpose of crossing the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> near <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The main body of their force is believed to be moving still on the north side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The force which they sent across the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> yesterday at <placeName reg="Longbridge, Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2469205">Long Bridge</placeName>, and which advanced up the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road about <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Riddle's Shop">Riddle's Shop</placeName></placeName> and the road leading to <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>, until checked and driven back by <persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Mahone,nomatch:0"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wilcox,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Wilcox,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilcox</surname></persName>, consisted of <num value="2">two</num> picked divisions of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> infantry from the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 5">5th corps</orgName>, a division of cavalry, and a battery of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This force came across merely to divert our attention, and with no purpose of seizing <placeName reg="Malven Hill">Malven Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They quickly, and almost without resistance, gave back when our infantry came up, retiring some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, and as seen as night came on they began moving down the south sine of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> towards the <rs>James</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> In this fight we lost some <num value="80">eighty</num> or <num value="90">ninety</num> men. The loss of the enemy is unknown beyond some <measure n="30" type="prisoners">thirty prisoners</measure> we captured. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Nothing worthy of special note has recently occurred along our lines in <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002267">Chesterfield county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There is apparently some movement going on among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but what it portends has not yet been definitely ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They have elevated their observatory on the <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName> Peninsula to the height of over <measure n="100feet" type="distance">one hundred feet</measure>, and it now towers above the highest trees in its vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is situated on <placeName><persName n="Cobb,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Cobb,nomatch:0"><surname>Cobb</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, and commands a complete view of the surrounding country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>A few days ago a piece of artillery was placed in a position to play upon this observatory, and, it is reported, succeeded in striking it once or twice, but before much damage could be done the enemy's batteries compelled a removal of the gun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> On Monday a body of the enemy's cavalry made a sudden dash on the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 1473" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName> road and <measure n="2" type="captured">captured two</measure> of our pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><num value="2">Two</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> tumbled off their horses from sheer fright, and were captured in a perfectly sound condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It was thought by some that this demonstration was a precursor of a more formidable movement against <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, but up to the date of our latest advices nothing of the sort had been developed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Persons who arrived yesterday from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, report all quiet in that city. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> It was currently reported yesterday that a force of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry had struck the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside Railroad</orgName> at <placeName reg="Concord Depot">Concord Depot</placeName>, <measure n="13miles" type="distance">thirteen miles</measure> this side of <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, and torn up the track at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>This turned out to be true, but the damages were soon repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>An official dispatch received yesterday gives assurance that <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> will be well defended, and may now be regarded as safe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> An instance of heroism is mentioned in connection with the advance of the enemy upon <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> which is worthy of record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>An ammunition train left that place about <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> last, by the <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> road, and returned the same evening at <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time>. When the train went down, a gentleman named <persName n="Dowdy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Dowdy,nomatch:0"><surname>Dowdy</surname></persName>, who had a <num value="100">hundred</num> unarmed men with him, took the responsibility of seizing an equal number of muskets that were on the train, armed his men, and got off at <placeName reg="Tye River Bridge">Tye River Bridge</placeName>, with the avowed purpose of defending it to the last extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There is no confirmation of the report that this bridge was destroyed by the enemy. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Affairs are becoming decidedly interesting in this locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Yesterday evening, about <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time>, a force of the enemy, numbers not stated, reached <placeName reg="Arrington Depot">Arrington Depot</placeName>, on the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria railroad</orgName>, in <placeName reg="Nelson, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002175">Nelson county</placeName>, <measure n="24miles" type="distance">twenty-four miles</measure> from this city, and burned the buildings at that place, and <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> several small treatle bridges near by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>At <num value="2">2</num> P M to-day they reached <placeName reg="Amherst, Amherst, Virginia" key="tgn,2110321">Amherst</placeName> C H, <measure n="13miles" type="distance">thirteen miles</measure> from here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Strong in the persuasion of the justice of our cause, in the gallant devotion of our citizen soldiers, and of the whole body of our people, and above all in the gracious protection of Heaven, we are not afraid so avow a sincere desire for peace on terms consistent with our honor and the permanent security of our rights, and as earnest aspiration to see the world once more restored to the beneficent pursuits of industry and of mutual intercourse and exchanges, so essential to its well-being, and which have been so gravely interrupted by the existence of this unnatural war in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> For ourselves, we have no fear of the result.--The widest pictures ever drawn of a disordered imagination comes short of the extravagance which could dream of the conquest of night <num value="1000000">millions</num> of people, resolved with <num value="1">one</num> mind&#x0022; to the freemen rather than live slaves,&#x0022; and forewarned by the savage and exterminating spirit in which this war has been waged upon them, and by the mad avowal of its patrons and supporters, of the worn than <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> bondage that aware them in the event of their subjugation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> When <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="nearbymention:Alexander,Chas,,,"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName> the <rs>Great</rs> was overrunning the <rs>East</rs>, it is recorded of him that at each successive victory he would say, <q>&#x0022;What will they think of this in <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName>?&#x0022;</q> In that stage of the world's existence, while <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName>, though enslaved, was still the <rs>Capital</rs> of civilization, and had it in her power to bestow or withhold reputation, we can understand the keen anxiety of the conqueror, who was desirous above all things to be regarded as a genuine Grock, to win the good opinion of its citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>But allowing, as we do, no such supremacy to <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, we are entirely at a loss to understand why there is so much anxiety in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to know what the <rs>English</rs> people think of us. We are sure of <num value="1">one</num> thing at least, and that is, that whatever may be their opinion, they can do <hi rend="italics">us</hi> no good if favorable, and no harm if the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>We see that their Government is decidedly against us, and as that Government professes to be a popular Government, under the control of the people, we might infer that the people themselves are against us likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Yet we are continually feeding ourselves with the belief that the <rs>English</rs> people love us dearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>What if they do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>They will do nothing for us, and this is no time for empty professions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> We published yesterday a series of extracts from <name>English</name> papers of every shade of politics with regard to the battles in <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The sameness of the whole batch is so striking that any person might be excused for thinking they were all written by the same person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The reason of the strange likeness is evidently that they all derive their information from the same sources, and those sources hostile to us. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers throughout this war have been their historians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>How they represent us and our cause we all know well enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>We have just had ample specimens in the telegrams of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, which <hi rend="italics">we</hi> know to be a tissue of the most barefaced lies ever presented to a people who do not wish for truth, if it be unpalatable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>But of this the <rs>English</rs> newspaper writers know nothing, for they only rarely, and at long intervals, see our papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>For that reason they almost invariably get a false impression of the actual state of affairs, and upon the impression thus derived they base their articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>In these very articles, for instance, every <num value="1">one</num> of them speaks of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="nearbymention:Grant,H.,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s &#x0022;splendid strategy,&#x0022; as if it had ever once compelled <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to abandon a position before <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00270" reg="nearbymention:Grant,H.,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself had withdrawn from his front; as if it had ever once compelled <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to give way; as if, in every case, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had not <hi rend="italics">followed</hi> <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="nearbymention:Grant,H.,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, instead of retreating before him. The tone throughout would lead to the inference that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was falling back to his defences around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, with an army still strong, it is true, yet beaten in every engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>In a word, these papers but repeat the tale of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, which everybody here knows to be a monstrous falsehood, and which is now showing itself to be such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>With all their experience of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mendacity, at each repetition they yield the same credence that they did in the beginning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have always been more sensitive to the opinion of the world than any other people we are acquainted with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>We had always believed that the people of the <rs>South</rs> were comparatively indifferent, and we are sorry to see that evidences of the contrary begin to appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is the vainest of all animals &mdash; it is <num value="1">one</num> among their many national failing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>They wish all the world to believe that they are the most <rs>Valliant</rs> and most refined nation on the earth, that New York is the greatest of all cities, and that <persName n="Boston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00275" reg="mostcommon:Boston,nomatch:0"><surname>Boston</surname></persName> is the <rs>Athens</rs> of the modern world, and they are constantly calling upon foreigners to admire their mighty empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The South, on the contrary, has never laid claim to any particular species of greatness, and is therefore not liable to the rude shocks which Yankeedom sometimes meets to its vanity in the disallowance of its claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>True, it has produced a Washington and a Lee, a Marshall and a Henry, a Jefferson and a Calhoun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>True, the only <hi rend="italics">statement</hi> of the old Union came form within her borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Her valor has been sufficiently illustrated in this war to place her on a level with any people that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>But she invites, on this account, no comparisons, and we cannot see why she should care <num value="1">one</num> farthing for the judgment of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> or any other country.
