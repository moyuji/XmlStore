<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It is some consolation to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name> to be led to hope that this suffering and this distress are rather diminishing than increasing, and that some renewal of employment is beginning to take place in the manufacturing districts. &#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Steamship Canada"></bibl></cit>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Darby</foreName></persName> criticised the <rs>Queen</rs>'s speech at length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He spoke in congratulatory terms on the <rs>Prince</rs> of <persName n="Waler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Waler,nomatch:0"><surname>Waler</surname></persName>'s marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He said he had no objection to raise against the course the <rs>Government</rs> had adopted in regard to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war, but he regretted that the <rs>Government</rs> had not felt themselves justified in joining the attempt, in which they were invited by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, not to intervene, nor for the purpose of putting an end to the war, but to obtain by their good offices, if possible, such an armistice and cessation of hostilities as would lead the <num value="2">two</num> parties themselves to reflect on the miseries and hopelessness of the war in which they were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Before he censured the course taken by the <rs>Government</rs>, it was but fair that he should say they were in possession of much better information than he was as to whether interference on their part would have been judicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He differed from the opinion expressed by many of his political friends, that the time had arrived for recognizing the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>There were only <num value="2">two</num> classes on which recognition on the part of a usual Power could be justified &mdash; namely: where there was no further struggle going on, or where it was desirable in the interests of humanity that the great Powers should interfere in order to prevent the continuance of a desolating warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But in that case recognition was always followed by something further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/><hi rend="italics">It meant support by force of arms</hi> of the claims of the country whose right was recognized, such as was the case on the separation of <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> from <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>, and of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>His conviction was that come what may, the reconstruction of the <name>States</name> as they formerly stood was absolutely impossible, and on the whole he approved the course which the <rs>Government</rs> had taken [Cheers] He then deplored the distress which the war had brought on the <name>Lancashire</name> operative and reviewed the foreign policy of the <rs>Government</rs> in regard to Italy Greece, etc., and deprecated the idea of ceding the <rs type="place">Ionien Islands</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Purcell</foreName></persName>, in reply, justified the policy of <unclear></unclear> intervention which the <rs>Government</rs> had pursued in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war. The circumstances were very different from those which existed when <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> was separated from Ulland and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>; and, taking all matters into conspiration, he thought the <rs>Government</rs> has taken the wisest course in their power to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>At the same time, he expressed the strong opinion that it would be impossible for the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States to be again established. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Malmsburg</foreName></persName> expressed regret that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had not joined <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in the proposed mediation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Gray</foreName></persName> took the contrary view, and after a few more speeches the address was agreed to. </p>

Allowing to the distress in the cotton districts, he said the <rs type="place">House</rs> might on such occasions, expect to learn how long this state of things is likely to last; but for his own part, he could not but regard what was passing in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> as revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He briefly sketched the rise of the <rs>Union</rs>, and expressed the opinion that the ultimate results of the war would be an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> very different to that known to our fathers, and even to this generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>There would be an America of armies, an America of diplomacy, and an America of turbulency and wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He believed the course originally marked out by the <rs>Government</rs> was <num value="1">one</num> honorable to the country, and beneficial to all its interests.--He was greatly surprised in the autumn when an important member of the <rs>Government</rs>, apparently with the sanction of his colleagues, made a deceleration which could only be regarded as an intention to recognize the <rs>Confederate Republic</rs>.--He felt there was great vacillation and inconsistency on the part of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The Foreign <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> said that the <rs>North</rs> was fighting for empire, and the <rs>South</rs> for independence; but the <rs>President</rs> of the <orgName n="Trade Board" type="board">Board of Trade</orgName> alleged that the curse of slavery was at the bottom of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He found fault with sundry Government proceedings in their foreign policy, and opposed the cession of the <rs n="Ionian" type="ethnic">Ionian</rs> Islands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> replied, but said nothing of moment in regard to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>After a recess of <num value="6">six</num> eventful months there is not a single statesman on either side who believes that the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> on the terms of the original compact is possible; not <num value="1">one</num> who believes that the forcible subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> is possible.

<head>Supplies.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> The supplies for this city are very limited, and prices are enormously high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>We cannot believe that provisions are scarce to a degree insufficient for the support of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The system of transportation and distribution is either obstructed or is insufficient to do the work required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The Government has indeed forestalled the market by stopping the supplies <hi rend="italics">in transitu</hi> on some routes, while it is almost impossible to get transportation on others, which are preoccupied by Government work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> Alarmed by the seizure of provisions in some sections, several counties formerly sending considerable supplies to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> have interdicted the exportation of meat and breadstuffs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> These causes operating together have seriously diminished the supplies for this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>So great is the falling off that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It becomes a serious question for the consideration of both Government and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is the seat of Government of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>A large part of its population is engaged in the service of the <num value="2">two</num> Governments, in the public offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Their duties are hors, and here they must remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Then there are large numbers of persons employed in Government work, furnishing arms and machinery, etc,' for the <rs>Government</rs>; and there lyed a very important and indispensable population of all sorts of people, forming quite an army of itself, engaged in the feeding, lodging, clothing, &#x0026;c., of all these others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Yet, again, there are the army officers, called continually here, and temporarily sojourning here, in large numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>With all these there as still to be counted the many hospitals of sick and wounded, and their numerous attendants, of physicians, stewards, nurses, etc. So that we find an immense population here, forming a great city in itself, separate and apart from the many refugees and those who were here before the war who have neither office, occupation nor emolument from the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Such a population requires a vast amount of provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>They are already hard pressed by the scarcity manifested through exorbitant prices, and there is reason to fear that the pressure is yet to be heavier, unless something is done to allow the necessaries of life to flow more liberally into the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> Persons out of the army and out of the offices, to provide for it know little of its wants and the prospect of supplying them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>It would be untrue to say that the measures of sizing the provisions were unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>But it may be conjectured with probable correctness that in some localities the system has been administered with too over bearing and sweeping a hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> Whatever be the truth in this respect, there is <num value="1">one</num> <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> which is true, and that is, that the best way to distribute supplies of all sorts is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to collect them at a point convenient for discrimination in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Therefore, even for furnishing the army itself, it would he advantageous to bring supplies together in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>To bring them here with this view would give the higher and more responsible class of officials the control of them, no doubt to the benefit of the army, as a more equitable distribution would be ensured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> The securing of this advantage to the public service would be attended with great benefit to all the numerous classes of citizens we have specified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>It would reduce the cost of living, now so high as to threaten many who live on very limited in comes &mdash; some of them women and children, orphans and minors &mdash; with distress.

<head>Trials of the. People.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> Of all the afflictions to which humanity is subject that of war &mdash; and especially such a war as the present &mdash; is the most terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>A few years ago not <num value="1">one</num> man in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States could have formed the slightest conception of its sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Wars had always existed among mankind from the bestowing of human history; but reading of its horror is <num value="1">one</num> thing, and being involved in them quite another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The present generation in these States had known nothing of them personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Their lot was <num value="1">one</num> of extraordinary exemption from most of those great evils &mdash; plague, pestilence, and battle &mdash; with which mankind in the old world had become familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>It could not be expected that <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> would always remain an exception to the common fate of humanity; and yet, how few of us anticipated such a state of things as the present ! These tribulations are felt the more keenly because of their novelty, and because of their contrast to our former condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>These sufferings are universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>With the exception of the few who are fattening upon the public distress, the same shadow rests over every heart, the same griefs and anxieties agitate every bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>All this is compatible with entire devotion to the cause, and only renders more meritorious the patriotism which grown brighter amidst affliction, and derives new strength from adversity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> Surely never, since the beginning of time, have a people made greater sacrifices than the people of the <rs>South</rs>--sacrifices voluntarily and cheerfully made and involving the choicest of their earthly possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>There has not been a household in which some mother or wife, with the faith of Ababa, has not offered up a child, and often every child, upon the altar of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The whole Southern army is made up of such willing sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>What heart rending anxieties have been aroused in Southern homes since the beginning of the war for the fate of the individuals composing that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>How many <num value="1000">thousand</num> fireflies has it desolated ! What deprivations have the people at large suffered ! And, of all classes of the people, what can compare in trials and perils with that glorious army, which, whatever the fate of this war, will be remembered in history as the most heroic and self sacrificing army that ever trod the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Whilst the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> journals have freely conceded that the annals of ancient and modern times furnish few such examples of lofty courage and devotion as those of the soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, they cannot know, as we know, how vastly superior to the rank and file of most armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>In all the qualities that adorn human nature, are the gentlemen who compose the mass of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>They were not driven to arms, like the <rs>Northern</rs> soldiers and the mercenaries of other lands, by their necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>On the contrary, there are few of them who would have subjected their slaves to such deprivations of food, clothing, and rest as they have themselves cheerfully endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Met <num value="1">one</num> of them-ever knew want or hardship till be became a soldier, and yet not a murmur, not a complaint; but, on the contrary, their spirits seem to rise the higher with every new pressure; and as for danger, each of them might say. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;Danger and I were thin lions, </l><l>Littered in <num value="1">one</num> day, </l><l>And I the older and more terrible.&#x0022; </l> </lg> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> What a contrast does their conduct present to that of the sharpers and speculators who have the heart to currach themselves by their necessities.--If people in civil life are ever tempted to murmur under their sufferings let them look at the infinitely greater privations of the army, and the sublime fortitude with, which they are endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We know not what further trials may be in store for <unclear></unclear> but this we know, the public mind of the <rs>South</rs> is prepared for every human affliction, for death itself, rather than submission to the greater evil &mdash; because involving degradation and shams &mdash; of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deamination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Most of the sufferings of the war are the work of the enemy, and we are not likely soon to forget or forgive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>As for the harpies in our own limits, whose grinding exhorting are threatening more injury to our cause then the arms of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> a day may come when the vengeance of outraged humanity will out to them the punishment they deserve. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
