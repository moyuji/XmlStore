<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> --The <hi rend="italics">Army and Navy Gazette,</hi> an English military and naval periodical, expresses the opinion that the military preparations now making by the <rs>North</rs> will end in the overthrow of the heroic <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> It is rational to conclude that this journal derives most of its intelligence from Northern sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It never sees the full Southern side of the question.--An eminent Spanish General visited <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s camp during the siege of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and was clear in the conviction that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was a dead cock in the pit. We suggested at the time that it would be well for this Spanish Generalissimo to visit the <rs>Confederate</rs> as well as Federal camps before coming to so decisive a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The result proved that the highest military authority outside of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> may blunder egregiously, and is in great danger of blundering simply because it hears only <num value="1">one</num> side of the story; and whilst it sees the preparations for assault, knows nothing of the resources for defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> If the <rs>British</rs> <hi rend="italics">Army and Navy Gazette</hi> had been published during the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, it would, at a certain gloomy period of that struggle, have pronounced the defeat of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> inevitable, and with much better reason than it now prophecies the downfall of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Even <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> was very much of the same opinion, for he declared that, if the army were not recruited, the game was nearly up. Even the <hi rend="italics">Army and Navy Gazette</hi> admits that we have <num value="1">one</num> chance &mdash; if <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is now able to rout the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, &#x0022;another year will be gained, and with <unclear>it</unclear>, who knows what gain may be obtained for the <rs>Confederates</rs>?&#x0022; The <hi rend="italics">Gazette </hi> must be sadly ignorant of &#x0022;the situation,&#x0022; and of the capacities of the <rs>South</rs> when it treats as problematical the existence of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for another year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We are stronger now than we were a year ago; glorious harvests; the currency improving; the tax bill bidding fair to yield an enormous revenue; our armies increasing every day in numbers and efficiency; our whole population, independent of the army, about to be organized into an embattled host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>When therefore the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi> speaks of <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName> as a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">caput mortum,</hi></foreign> it is as much out of its reckoning as the <rs>Spanish General</rs> who confidently predicted its capture by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, and, even if it were taken, nothing but the brick and mortal it is built of would be lost to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. &#x0022;Another year gained&#x0022; may help the <rs>Confederacy</rs> through!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If that is all that is necessary, we are safe enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will outlive the <hi rend="italics">Army and Navy Gazette,</hi> and exist as long as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> itself. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> --To &#x0022;rule or ruin&#x0022; the <rs>South</rs> has been the manifest and controlling principle of the <rs>Abolition Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from the beginning of this war. Its efforts were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> directed to <hi rend="italics">rule,</hi> but failing after <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> trial in that, its whole energies are now bent to <hi rend="italics">ruin.</hi> What is this but an admission that it never expects to conquer the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If it did, why <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> should it labor with all its power to render the <rs>South</rs> not worth having? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> It is not merely the ruin of towns and public buildings, and the desolation of fields, or the slaughter of our people, which show the inconsistency of the present destructive policy of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> dynasty with the anticipation of conquering the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Towns may be rebuilt, desolated fields will grow green again, a population grievously thinned by war may be again replenished; but when the only system of labor by which towns can be restored, fields cultivated, and a population supported, is to be torn up by the roots, we may fairly conclude that the architects of such destruction are aiming to ruin rather than to rule.--That the <rs>Cotton States</rs> can ever be cultivated except by slave labor, is a lunacy which we are not warranted in attributing even to the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>If they really expect to emancipate the slaves and still make the country profitable, which is the only condition on which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> desire a country, they are the most hopeless madmen the world has ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If the <rs>South</rs> is to be subjugated, she could not inflict upon her conqueror a more fatal stab than that he is preparing for his own bosom.--Burning the cotton that it may not fall into his hands is nothing to his own plan of destroying the labor by which the cotton is raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Emancipate the slaves and the cotton-growing States become as profitless to the commerce and manufacturers of the world as <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName> and <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Hence we can only under stand the abolition and destructive policy of the <orgName n="U. S.
