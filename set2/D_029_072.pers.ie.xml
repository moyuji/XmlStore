<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> Our correspondent at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, yesterday, gave some of the particulars of the fight at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>It appears that a reconnaissance in force was made of the enemy's position near the river on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at an early hour, which was brilliantly executed as far as it went, but was, unfortunately, attended with some little loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The sharpshooters were notified of the duties expected of them, and perfect quiet imposed upon their movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The assault was intended to be a surprise to the enemy; and such, indeed, it proved to be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> About <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>, everything being in readiness, the corps of sharpshooters, about <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> strong, left our works, and, with empty guns, advanced stealthily, but rapidly, upon the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>They fell like a thunderclap upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> behind the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of works they struck, clubbing such as they found awake with their muskets, bagging a good many prisoners, and capturing several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Not a musket was fired, and not a man injured on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Unfortunately, some of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who had escaped in the darkness, fled, and aroused the men in the rear line of works, and the alarm was quickly spread throughout the reserve camps behind, so that a formidable force was soon alert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>By the time our troops had formed into line on either side of the captured fort, the enemy was thoroughly aroused, and was prepared for further offensive operations on our side; otherwise, the advance of our troops <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> would have been irresistible and successful beyond anticipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>As it was, they came in a position subject to an enfilading fire on either side, and confronted by heavy forts and breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were not slow to take advantage of the opportunity thus afforded them, and they quickly massed artillery in the neigh boring forts, and infantry in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>They made several fierce assaults upon our columns, in heavy lines which were repulsed with great coolness and vigor, and in which it is believed the enemy sustained much loss. </p> </q><bibl n="The Petersburg Express"></bibl></cit>
