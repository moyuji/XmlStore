<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The appearance of the militia of the <rs>Republic</rs> is quite prepossessing, though, like all militia, the variety of uniform adopted by the different companies would mar the general effect on review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>For the most part, however, there is some attempt at uniformity in dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This is rendered necessary by the quality and texture of cloth from which the clothing is made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><persName n="Grey,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grey,nomatch:0"><surname>Grey</surname></persName> is the predominant color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The cloth is manufactured chiefly in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, while some of it is imported from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The material is generally serviceable and warm, and, affording no glaring or marked appearance, is particularly adapted to warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In clothing the men for service the gaudy tinsel and finery of the peaceful volunteer is left behind for quieter times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>As yet the <rs>State</rs> has ordered the observance of no uniformity in the dress of her warriors.--The <rs type="role" reg="chief-Officer">chief officers</rs>, nevertheless, have adopted a kind of undress uniform that is simple, neat and tasteful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I notice the <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</rs> and the members of his staff at times on the street with blue-black cloth <rs n="frock coats" type="product">frock coats</rs>, silver-washed <placeName key="tgn,2020752" n="1.000 1" reg="palmetto, manatee, florida">Palmetto</placeName> buttons, and a Palmetto tree worked upon the shoulders within a parallelogram of silver cord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The fatigue cap adopted is of the same cloth as the coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Its shape is of the &#x0022;rakish&#x0022; wide-awake style so much in vogue with all our military companies; still the hat is rendered peculiarly <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> by the inevitable <rs>Palmetto</rs> worked with silver upon the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>the cap is otherwise trimmed with silver cord. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The coat is trimmed with gilt buttons and bullion <placeName key="tgn,2020752" n="1.000 1" reg="palmetto, manatee, florida">Palmetto</placeName> decorations on the shoulders. </p> </q><bibl n="Baltimore American"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It contains all the views delivered by the others: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jeff,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.--I rise, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, for the purpose of announcing to the <name>Senate</name> that I have satisfactory evidence that the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName>, by a solemn ordinance of her people in Convention assembled, has declared her separation from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Under these circumstances, of course my functions are terminated here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It has seemed to me proper, however, that I should appear in the <name>Senate</name> to announce that fact to my associates, and I will say but very little more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The occasion does not invite me to go into argument; and my physical condition would not permit me to do so if it were otherwise; and yet it seems to become me to say something on the part of the <rs>State</rs> I here represent on an occasion so solemn as this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> It is known to <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> who have served with me here, that I have for many years advocated as an essential attribute of State sovereignty, the right of a State to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Therefore, if I had not believed there was justifiable cause; if I had thought that <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> was acting without sufficient provocation, or without an existing necessity, I should still, under my theory of the <rs>Government</rs>, because of my allegiance to the <rs>State</rs> of which I am a citizen, have been bound by her action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>I, however, may be permitted to say that I do think she has justifiable cause, and I approve of her act. I conferred with her people before that act was taken, counselled them then that if the state of things which they apprehended should exist when the <rs>Convention</rs> met, they should take the action which they have now adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> I hope none who hear me will confound this expression of mine with the advocacy of me right of a State to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>, and to disregard its constitutional obligations by the nullification of the law. Such is not my theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Nullification and secession, so often confounded, are indeed antagonistic principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Nullification is a remedy which it is sought to apply within the <rs>Union</rs>, and against the agent of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It is only to be justified when the agent has violated his constitutional obligation, and a State, assuming to judge for itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and appeals to the other States of the <rs>Union</rs> for a decision; but when the <name>States</name> themselves, and when the people of the <name>States</name>, have so acted as to convince us that they will not regard our constitutional rights, then, and then for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, arises the doctrine of secession in its practical application. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> A great man, who now reposes with his fathers, and who has been often arraigned for a want of fealty to the <rs>Union</rs>, advocated the doctrine of nullification because it preserved the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>It was because of his deep-seated attachment to the <rs>Union</rs>; his determination to find some remedy for existing ills short of a severance of the ties which bound <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to the other States, that <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> advocated the doctrine of nullification, which he proclaimed to be peaceful; to be within the limits of State power, not to disturb the <rs>Union</rs>, but only to be a means of bringing the agent before the tribunal of the <name>States</name> for their judgment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> Secession belongs to a different class of remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It is to be justified upon the basis that the <name>States</name> are sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>There was a time when none denied it. I hope the time may come again, when a better comprehension of the theory of our Government, and the inalienable rights of the people of the <name>States</name>, will prevent any <num value="1">one</num> from denying that each State is a sovereign, and thus may reclaim the grants which it has made to any agent whomsoever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> I therefore say I concur in the action of the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, believing it to be necessary and proper, and should have been bound by their action if my belief had been otherwise; and this brings me to the important point which I wish, on this last occasion, to present to the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It is by this confounding of nullification and secession that the name of a great man, whose ashes now mingle with his mother earth, has been invoked to justify coercion against a seceded State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The phrase, &#x0022;to execute the laws,&#x0022; was an expression which <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Jonathan,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> applied to the case of a State refusing to obey the laws while yet a member of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>That is not the case which is now presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The laws are to be executed over the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and upon the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.--They have no relation to any foreign country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>It is a perversion of terms, at least it is a great misapprehension of the case, which cites that expression for application to a State which has withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>You may make war on a foreign State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>If it be the purpose of gentlemen, they may make war against a State which has withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>; but there are no laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to be executed within the limits of a seceded State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>A State finding herself in the condition in which <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> has judged she is, in which her safety requires that she should provide for the maintenance of her rights out of the <rs>Union</rs>, surrenders all the benefits, (and they are known to be many,) deprives herself of the advantages, (they are known to be great,) severs all the ties of affection, (and they are close and enduring,) which have bound her to the <rs>Union</rs>, and thus divesting herself of every benefit, taking upon herself every burden, she claims to be exempt from any power to execute the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within her limits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> I well remember an occasion when <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was arraigned before the bar of the <name>Senate</name>, and when the doctrine of coercion was rife and to be applied against her because of the rescue of a fugitive slave in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>My opinion then was the same it is now. Not in a spirit of egotism, but to show that I am not influenced in my opinion because the case is my own, I refer to that time and that occasion as containing the opinion which I then entertained and on which my present conduct is based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I then said if <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, following her through a stated line of conduct, chooses to take the last step which separates her from the <rs>Union</rs>, it is her right to go, and I will neither vote <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> nor <num value="1">one</num> man to coerce her back, but will say to her, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed, in memory of the kind associations which once existed between her and the other States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> It has been a conviction of pressing necessity, it has been a belief that we are to be deprived in the <rs>Union</rs> of the rights which our fathers bequeathed to us, which has brought <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> into her present decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>She has heard proclaimed the theory that all men are created free and equal, and this made the basis of an attack upon her social institutions; and the sacred <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> has been invoked to maintain the position of the equality of the races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>That <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> is to be construed by the circumstances and purposes for which it was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The communities were declaring their independence; the people of those communities were asserting that no man was born, to use the language of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, booted and spurred to ride over the rest of mankind; that men were created equal &mdash; meaning the men of the political community; that there was no divine right to rule; that no man inherited the right to govern; that there were no classes by which power and place descended to families; but that all stations were equally within the grasp of each member of the body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>These were the great principles they announced; these were the purposes for which they made their declaration; these were the ends to which their enunciation was directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>They have no reference to the slave; else, how happened it that among the items of arraignment made against <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>was that he endeavored to do just what the <rs>North</rs> has been endeavoring of late to do, to stir up insurrection among our slaves?--Had the declaration announced that the negroes were free and equal, how was the <rs>Prince</rs> to be arraigned for stirring up insurrection among them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>And how was this to be enumerated among the high crimes which caused the colonies to sever their connection with the mother country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>When our Constitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable, for there we find provision made for that very class of persons as property; they were not put upon the footing of equality with white men &mdash; not even upon that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as representation was concerned, were discriminated against as a lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical proportion of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> Then, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, we recur to the compact which binds us together; we recur to the principles upon which our Government was founded; and when you deny them, and when you deny to us the right to withdraw from a Government which, thus perverted, threatens to be destructive of our rights, we but tread in the path of our fathers when we proclaim our independence, and take the hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>This is done not in hostility to others, not to injure any section of the country, not even for our own pecuniary benefit; but from the high and solemn motive of defending and protecting the rights we inherited, and which it is our sacred duty to transmit unshorn to our children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> I find in myself, perhaps, a type of the general feeling of my constituents towards your.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>I am sure I feel no hostility to you, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>I am sure there is not <num value="1">one</num> of you, whatever sharp discussion there may have been between us, to whom I cannot now say, in the presence of my <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I wish you well; and such, I am sure, is the feeling of the people whom I represent towards those whom you represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>I therefore feel that I but express their desire when I say I hope, and they hope, for peaceful relations with you, though we must part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>They may be mutually beneficial to us in the future, as they have been in <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> the past, if you so will it. The reverse may bring disaster on every portion of the country; and if you will have it thus, we will invoke the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of our fathers, who delivered them from the power of the lion, to protect us from the ravages of the bear; and thus, putting our trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and in our own firm hearts and strong arms, we will vindicate the right as best we may. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> In the course of my service here, associated at different times with a great variety of <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, I see now around me some with whom I have served long; there have been points of collision, but whatever of offence there has been to me, I leave here; I carry with me no hostile remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Whatever offence I have given which has not been redressed, or for which satisfaction has not been demanded, I have, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, in this hour of our parting, to offer you my apology for any pain which, in the heat of discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>I have inflicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>I go hence unencumbered of the remembrance of any injury received, and having discharged the duty of making the only reparation in my power for any injury offered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, having made the announcement which the occasion seemed to me to require, it only remains for me to bid you a final adieu. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> At the beginning of this session, now more than half over, committees were appointed in both Houses of Congress to consider the state of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Neither committee has been able to agree upon any mode of settlement of the pending issues between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> In this state of facts, our duty is to warn you that it is vain to hope for any measures of conciliation or adjustment from Congress, which you could accept.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/> The condition of commercial affairs presents no new feature at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Abroad, however, we see that troubles here are not without their effect.--Latest foreign intelligence shews that both in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> the influence of the commercial embarrassments growing out of the political discord here is most decidedly felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the rate of interest had been put up by the <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName> to <num value="0.07">7 per cent.</num> to check operations and save its bullion, which had been rapidly diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>There was a general decline in the markets, save in <hi rend="italics">Cotton,</hi> which was improving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>The exhibit of the <orgName n="France Bank" type="bank">Bank of France</orgName> was looked for with uneasiness, as tending to increase the panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Thus it will be seen that an unprincipled party in this country cannot trample upon the rights of half the <rs>Union</rs> with impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>In the gratification of their traitorous ambition they have sown the seeds not only of discord, but of distress and destruction to industry and commerce in <num value="2">two</num> hemispheres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>They are not to escape these evils unscathed, themselves &mdash; by no means &mdash; as we shall see. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> We give below the quotations of this market, from which it will be seen that there are not many changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Breadstuffs are a little better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Money is still scarce; but there are no failures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Exchange is a little higher. </p>
