<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> This national anniversary will pass by under circumstances novel and strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It cannot be celebrated in the usual style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The condition of the country does not admit of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We have a war, in which the very people who asserted their independence on this day, <measure n="85years" type="date">eighty-five years</measure> ago, are struggling, the <num value="1">one</num> for the maintenance of the principles of that independence, the other for crushing them to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The day is still to us a day memorable for the assertion of principles we revere, and mean to defend with our lives and the last drop of our blood, while to them it should be a day of mourning for the liberties which it proclaimed, but which they have lost, probably forever, in order to force the yoke of tyranny upon the <rs>South</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> It is to be regretted that <num value="1">one</num> of the incidents of the present struggle is the inability of our people to celebrate this day according to usage &mdash; indeed it would be inappropriate at such a time to undertake to observe it in that manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>But it is a sufficient tribute to it that we are engaged in the maintenance of the principles of human rights and liberty it announced, and that we are ready to sacrifice our lives and all we have in the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Could the departed sages of '<num value="76">76</num> behold the scenes of today, they could desire no better evidence of devotion to their acts and principles than is displayed by the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Today, when the <rs>North</rs> meets in Congress to approve tyranny, to sanction usurpation, and sustain a war of oppression and desolation, we are at our guns ready to resist that war, and to triumph or perish in the struggle for the principles of the unanimous declaration of the immortal Congress of <date value="1776-07-04">4th July, 1776.</date> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Plans have been adopted to continue such a supply as can be collected here, and we are encouraged to believe that we are prepared for any call that is likely to be made upon us at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>This was a temporary election, held while the ranks were yet unfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The company, many weeks after this, disbanded because there was no provision for guerilla service; and, when offered as regular cavalry, were rejected because there was already a sufficiency of that service in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/> --To call a man a liar is not to prove him false; to denounce him as a traitor is not to establish his reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>The eloquence which consists of personal aspersion is a gun of which the recoil is much more fatal than the discharge; and since cursing is much easier than convincing, when a man begins the <num value="1">one</num> you may be very sure that he despairs of the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/> But the fatal difficulty with wholesale personal vituperation is that its tendency is to compel moment to your own course not by persuasion and conviction, which are the only honorable motives of conduct, but by the fear of abuse or the desire to a void the expectoration of scurrility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Vituperation is akin to the skunk's argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>It you cross me, it says, I will make you smell as badly as I can Vituperation pre-supposes infallibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/><q>&#x0022;I think,&#x0022;</q> it style, <q>&#x0022;that the only way to avoid a terrible injustice is to do thus, and I think so honestly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>You don't agree with me; you pretend to believe that it can be avoided in some other way. Pooh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>you are dishonest, treacherous, week, and time serving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>You are a traitor, a fool, a perjurer, a knave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>You are a liar, a scoundrel, a thief, and a murderer.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/> What reply remains to the person so assailed but pity and contempt, and the silent appeal to the heart of mankind, which is just at last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/> There is a plea which is sometimes made for this acrimonious personal criticism and apportion of motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>It is this: <q>&#x0022;Here I am.&#x0022;</q> says the orator, <q>&#x0022;in a community which looks to certain men as its examples, not to certain principles as its guides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>Now I may talk till I drop about the duty of being just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Everybody agrees abstractly, but goes on following the models who act unjustly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>If, then, I say distinctly <q>&#x0022;this model of yours is a mean, time serving man, because, in my estimation, he does unjustly,&#x0022;</q> the followers are aroused by their personal interest and outraged sense of propriety to see just what it is I mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>If the idols of the young men are base, show and say that they are so, and their worship will corrupt the young men no more.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/> This is the plea, but it does not touch the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>It is not showing that the idol is base merely to say that it is so. It is necessary, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, to establish the dishonesty of the man; and when you have done that you do not need to blackguard him. The proof of his dishonesty is a sharper sting than lies in any word of yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>But to assume his dishonesty because he differs from you, and thereupon to pelt him with bid names, that is a folly and a fault which the universal instinct of men perceives and condemns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>You may hold to your own faith never so sincerely, yet you do not believe a bit more honestly than the man who profoundly differs from you. If you will not allow that men may honestly differ, and that you owe to what seems to you honest error in another man precisely the same consideration that you claim from him for your own sincere faith, you are really a monomaniac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Moral despotism is equally hateful in a triple crown, a peaked hat, or a broad brine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>We learn this truth slowly, but we learn it surely, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>The gentlemen would then see how disgusting as well as senseless the custom was, and, out of their respect to decency, if not to reason, they would be compelled to abandon it.
