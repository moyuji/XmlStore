<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The news from the front, a telegraphic synopsis of what I sent you last night, is of an encouraging and reassuring character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The enemy's advance forces, after their bloody repulse between <placeName key="tgn,2024554" n="1.000 207" reg="tunnel hill, whitfield, georgia">Tunnel Hill</placeName> and <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName> by <persName n="Cleburne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Cleburne,nomatch:0"><surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>, retreated to the mountain pass at the latter place, where they still remained at last advices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They destroyed the bridges as they retired, thus showing that they do not propose to follow us further at present, and that they are not willing for the <rs>Confederates</rs> to get at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Our rear is on this side of the burnt bridges beyond <placeName key="tgn,2024554" n="1.000 207" reg="tunnel hill, whitfield, georgia">Tunnel Hill</placeName>, where it presents a stern and defiant front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The main army is encamped around <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, where <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> has established his headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The trains and such forces as had reached <placeName key="tgn,2024046" n="1.000 167" reg="resaca, gordon, georgia">Resaca</placeName> have been ordered back to the same place, and I shall follow as soon as my horse is in condition to travel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The opinion was advanced in my telegram last night that there was no reason to apprehend an immediate advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Such is still my conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If the army could not be subsisted at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> without the aid of the railroad from that point to <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, neither can it be subsisted at <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> or <placeName reg="Kingston, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2023318">Kingston</placeName> without the possession of the <rs>Western</rs> and <address><street n="Atlantic road">Atlantic road</street></address>, and a sufficient number of locomotives and cars for the transportation of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These locomotives and cars <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> has not and probably cannot procure for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Rolling stock which would answer for <num value="1">one</num> road would be inadequate for <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The Federal commander will find it necessary, therefore, in order to an advance into the country, to accumulate supplies at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, to repair the railway bridges which his advance forces have already destroyed in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold</placeName>, and such others as the <rs>Confederates</rs> may destroy, and to provide a sufficient number of care and engine to transport supplies for his troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> In advancing this opinion, I take it for granted that he must advance, if at all this winter, by the railroad route, and not by <placeName reg="Willis Valley">Willis Valley</placeName>, in the direction of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The roads by the latter route, if not impassable in winter to heavily laden army wagons, are of such a character as to render it difficult, if not impossible, to subsist as large an army as his by wagon trains alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Indeed, if <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had intended to move directly upon <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>, and not <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, would have been chosen as his base of supplies, and, in that event, the struggle for <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> would not have been necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> But will <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> advance at all this winter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>His impossible, of course, for any <num value="1">one</num> except the <rs>Federal</rs> commander himself to answer this interrogatory, though it is permissible for us to speculate upon his probable designs, with the aid of such lights as are furnished by his previous conduct and present situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Omitting, as unnecessary to the argument, any inferences that might be drawn from his former campaigns, it is sufficient to say that he has neither the supplies nor the transportation to enable him at this time to move upon <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, the acknowledged goal of his ambition and the desires of his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>To advance along the railroad at this inauspicious season of the year, and repair the road as he moves, would be a herculean task &mdash; a task, let us hope, far beyond his power of accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is <placeName><distance reg="138miles">one hundred and thirty-eight miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName></placeName> to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>; the wagon made are inferior, and the intervening country is traversed by several <unclear></unclear> and numberless water courses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Can he cross this wide track under the heavy rains and frequent snows of winter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If he cannot, will he tempt to march a part of the way now, and the remainder in the spring?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The suggestion was made some time ago, in <num value="1">one</num> of these letters, that his efforts this fall would probably be limited to an attempt to get possession of the region of country lying west of the west branch of the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, and that early next spring he would put his army in motion towards the <orgName n="Great Railroad" type="railroad">great railway</orgName> centre at the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Can he do more than this now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The district from this place to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> in width, has been stript of its supplies, and an invading army would have to bring along with it all it required for its support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> may make an effort, however, to get possession of <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, the point where the <rs>Georgia</rs> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> road unites with the <rs>Western</rs> and <address><street n="Atlantic road">Atlantic road</street></address>, and even to reach the <placeName key="tgn,1123836" n="1.000 30" reg="etowah, georgia, united states">Etowah river</placeName>; but there is no reason to believe that he will attempt to go further now. The immediate possession of <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> was doubtless <num value="1">one</num> of the objects of his pursuit of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> since it would have cut off all communication by railway with <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, and all possibility of succor to <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> That an effort will be made to capture <address><street n="Long street">Long street</street></address> and his command, there is no room to doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>At last accounts, the <dateStruct value="--23"><day reg="23">23d inst.</day></dateStruct>, <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> was completely invested by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, who were only waiting for reinforcements, then about due, to make an assault upon the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>An intelligent officer, who left on that day, is very confident that the attack, if not prevented by the success of the enemy at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, would prove successful.--<persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>, with a portion of his command, has arrived at <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, having on his way chased the enemy from <placeName reg="Cleveland, Bradley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098519">Cleveland</placeName> and recaptured a portion of our lest wagon train. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I will endeavor to send you a detailed account of our losses in this particular as soon as I return to Dilton. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The weather is exceedingly cold, and many of the troops lost their blankets and shoes in the resent fight and on the retreat.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> When the <rs>French</rs> troops were drawn up on the day of the battle of the <name>Pyramids</name>, <unclear></unclear> rode before a favorite regiment, and, pointing to the huge piles which lay in full view, exclaimed &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Soddens, des hants de <unclear></unclear> Pyramides quarantine sirles vous contemplent.</hi>&#x0022; &#x0022;Soldiers, from the tops of those pyramids <measure n="40centuries" type="date">forty centuries</measure> look down upon you.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> We have no pyramids here, and no <measure n="40centuries" type="date">forty centuries</measure> to inspect our actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>But, as a substitute, we have the eyes of the living and contemporary world fixed upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and the august body which assembles to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Upon their action depends more than ever before, we candidly believe, depended upon the proceedings of any deliberative body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>They have the issues of life and death in their hands, and upon their breath depends the success or failure of the mighty struggle in which we are involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Greatly to our joy, we learn that the large majority of the members are fully aware of their responsibility, and fully equal to the task which has devolved upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>They have determined, so we learn, to make the greatest sacrifice which it is possible for members of Congress to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They have determined to deny themselves <num value="1">one</num> of their most exquisite enjoyments &mdash; to restrain that propensity which has so often been found uncontrollable, and the indulgence of which has more than once inflicted almost irreparable damage upon the public interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>They have resolved to make no long-winded speeches, to indulge in no appeals to <persName n="Bun,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Bun,nomatch:0"><surname>Bun</surname></persName> kum. Those who have never been in the habit of attending the sittings of legislative bodies can form no conception of the pain such a resolution must cost, and of the grandeur of the sacrifice it implies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Honor to those noble Congressmen who are prepared to sacrifice everything, even the pleasure of hearing themselves talk, to the good of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We have heard it suggested that ladies ought to be excluded from the gallery, thereby withdrawing <num value="1">one</num> main inducement for young members to show themselves off. But there will be no occasion now for such an ungallant proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The whole Congress &mdash; Senate and <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>, old members and young members, bachelors and Benedicts &mdash; all have determined to forget alike Bunkum and the fair sex for a season, and we hope that the fair sex and Bunkum will unite in assuring them that it is the very best thing they can do. Work, not talk, is the order of the day, and the only fear is that, having wasted the last session in unprofitable debate, they may go to the other extreme in this, and do some of their work without sufficient consideration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> The currency and the army will of course be the chief subjects of consideration &mdash; we were going to say discussion; but, fortunately, we are not likely to have much of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>With regard to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> subject, there is little doubt<unclear></unclear> that very decided steps will be taken in a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The evil is gigantic, and remedies of the most determined character must be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The &#x0022;infernal machine&#x0022; is to be stopped at once, so we learn, and steps taken for retiring the outstanding issues, of a character so decided that it will make persons who have been dealing in <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> at <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> times its actual value, wish they had never heard of it. Which of the many schemes proposed will be adopted, or whether an amalgam, compounded of the best parts of them all, we are, of course, unable to say.--But all of them look to the reduction of the volume of circulation by stopping the issue and drawing in the circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Some plan must be adopted to enhance the value of the circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>This can only be done by rendering it scarce and hard to come at. It will appreciate in proportion to the demand, and the demand will increase in proportion to the difficulty of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Commodities <unclear>ust</unclear> fall in proportion to the appreciation of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Whatever plan may be adopted, this is the object of them all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> The next subject that will engage the attention of Congress will be the army, and, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, the exempts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Congress has a noble programme chalked out for it in the message of <persName n="Bonham,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Bonham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Bonham</surname></persName>, noticed by us the other day. We have no doubt that it can add at least <num value="100000">100,000</num> men to our force in the field by calling out those who have gotten substitutes, and we feel no hesitation in saying that it ought to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>In <measure n="9cases" type="mass">nine cases</measure> out of <num value="10">ten</num> the substitutes desert, and thus the country is deprived of all service from that individual, either direct or secondary.--But it is not necessary to stop here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Let Congress go further, and put in the field all commissaries, quartermasters, and clerks, between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="45">forty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Another <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> might be obtained in this way, if the wagon drivers, teamsters, and persons occupied in similar employments, were added.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In a word, subject every man, between <num value="18">18</num> and <num value="45">45</num>, to military duty, and put in their places, where they are already occupied, men over <num value="45">45</num>, or men who have been rendered unfit by wounds for military service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> Congress, we understand, will enter upon all this with a bold hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>We hope they will and that the love of speech making may not tempt them to abandon their good resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>We appeal to Bunkum to listen to no &#x0022;stirring speeches,&#x0022; and to the young ladies to stay at home and not set the young men to talking. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Acknowledgment of the preeminent abilities of the <rs>Confederate President</rs> is universal with all parties abroad, and even at the <rs>North</rs> some of the most bitter revilers of the man concede the great intellectual and administrative qualities which he has manifested in this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>It is impossible that the whole world should be mistaken in its estimate of <num value="1">one</num> in the prominent and trying position of the leader of this great revolution; <num value="1">one</num> who has for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> been exposed to such an ordeal as mortal man has rarely endured, and whose acts and words have engaged the intense observation of all intelligent mankind.
