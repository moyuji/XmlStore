<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> A correspondent of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> writes a highly interesting account of a visit to the <term n="CS steamer">C. S. steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Florida</rs>, now lying at <placeName reg="Brest,Finistere,Bretagne,France,Europe" key="tgn,7008258">Brest, France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>We make some extracts from the letter which will be found to repay perusal: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> I had no difficulty in making out this now celebrated vessel, as she lay at anchor among some of the giants of the <rs>French</rs> navy &mdash; a long, low, black, rakish looking craft, not over smart in appearance, yet useful every inch of her &mdash; a pigmy among these monsters, and yet a formidable pigmy, even to the unpracticed eye, the palmetto flag flying proudly from her mizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We happened to have a French <rs type="role" reg="Vice-Admiral">Vice Admiral</rs>, a Russian <rs type="role" reg="Vice-Admiral">Vice Admiral</rs>, and a Senator of the <rs>Empire</rs> on board, and you may imagine there was an infinity of gossip, but no reliable information. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> When we landed at the <name>Cale</name> in the harbor the crowd which usually assembles to welcome or pester new comers was full of &#x0022;<foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">La Floride</hi></foreign> &#x0022; and her doings. &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Ellea</hi>&#x0022; cried an enthusiastic <hi rend="italics">commissionaire</hi> to me, <foreign lang="fre">&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">elle a, <rs type="role2">Monsieur</rs>, je vous assure sur ma parole d'honneur, pour deux <num value="1000000">millions</num> de lieres sterling a bord, tout en or, je vous assure.</hi> &#x0022; &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Eh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I could not help agreeing with the <hi rend="italics">mousse</hi> that the sum named was certainly a great deal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> That evening, (aided by my fellow traveler, <persName n="Tupper,Mister,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Tupper,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Tupper</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Vice-Consul">Vice Consul</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,2368259" n="1.000 5" reg="guernsey">Guernsey</placeName>, and <num value="1">one</num> of the jurats of that Island,) I found some of the officers of the <rs>Florida</rs> at the <rs type="place">Hotel</rs> de Nantes <foreign lang="fre">(rue d'aiguillon.)</foreign> <persName n="Hoole,Lieutenant,Lingard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Hoole,Lingard,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>Lingard</foreName> <surname>Hoole</surname></persName> (a young man, who apparently did not number more than <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>,) received us courteously, and gave us his card to assure us admission on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He stated, however, that his superior officer, <persName n="Maffit,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Maffit,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Maffit</surname></persName>, was generally to be found on board his vessel, and would be glad to see us. The frankness, courtesy, and total absence of boasting, manifested by this young officer impressed us most favorably. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> All next day it blew a gale of wind in the <name>Rade</name>, and we could not find a boat to venture out. To-day, however, the weather was most propitious, and early morning found us alongside of the <rs>Florida</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We sent our cards to <persName n="Maffit,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Maffit,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Maffit</surname></persName>, and were immediately admitted on board, the <rs>Captain</rs> himself coming to the top of the companion to receive us. Directly <persName n="Maffit,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Maffit,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Maffit</surname></persName> understood that we were <name>British</name> subjects he invited us below into his little cabin, and when I told him that there were many people in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> who regarded his career with great interest he entered very freely into a recital of his adventures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Of the <rs>Captain</rs> himself I may say that he is a slight, middle-sized, well knit man, of about <num value="42">42</num>, a merry looking man, with a ready, determined air, full of life and business &mdash; apparently the sort of man who is equally ready for a fight or a jollification, and whose preference for the latter would by no means interfere with his creditable conduct of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>His plainly-furnished little stateroom looked as business like as a merchant's office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The round table in the centre was strewn with books and innumerable manuscripts, and on the shelves were formidable looking rows of account books, charts, &#x0026;c. I may observe of the cabin, as of every part of the <rs>Florida</rs>, that none of it appears to have been built for ornament &mdash; all for use. &#x0022;You see,&#x0022; said the <rs>Captain</rs>, pointing to the heaps of papers, letters on files, account books,&#x0026;c, which literally littered the table, &#x0022;you see I've no sinecure of it. Since my paymaster died I've had to be my own paymaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There's a young man, named <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>, (no relation to our <rs type="role2">President</rs>,) who does paymaster's duty; but he's not yet quite up to the work.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In his opinion it has been the greatest naval feat of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He dwelt long and warmly upon the incidents of the affair, and pointed proudly to the marks of shrapnel, which are numerous enough, upon the masts and smokestacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <rs>Florida</rs> was struck with <num value="3">three</num> heavy shots on that occasion, and <num value="1">one</num> can easily perceive in the side of the ship where the mischief caused by the <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> shell has been repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs>Florida</rs> made no endeavor to reply to the fire which she received, the sea running too high to admit of steady aim, and her small crew being too much occupied in the management of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> showed us a water color sketch (very well drawn by <num value="1">one</num> of the midshipmen) of the <rs>Florida</rs> running the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It would not have disgraced a professional artist. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The only broadside which the <rs>Florida</rs> has fired in anger was against the <rs>Ericsson</rs>, an armed merchantman, which she encountered some <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> from New</placeName> York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The <rs>Ericsson</rs>, a very large vessel, did not reply, but made the best of her way off, and succeeded in escaping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>When they ventured within <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> of New</placeName> York they did not know that the arrival of the <rs>Tacony</rs> (<num value="1">one</num> of their &#x0022;outfits,&#x0022;) had put the New Yorkers on their guard, and they soon found that there were about <num value="70">seventy</num> armed vessels out searching for them, and so were glad to retreat. &#x0022;We never seek a fight,&#x0022; said <persName n="Maffitt,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Maffitt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Maffitt</surname></persName>, &#x0022;and we don't avoid <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Our object is merely to destroy their commerce, so as to bring about a peace.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The <rs>Captain</rs> exhibited a book in which all the prizes were regularly entered and all particulars relating thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He explained that their mode of procedure was to burn and destroy the property of the <rs>Northern States</rs> wherever they found it. I asked if they took gold and precious articles, and the reply was, &#x0022;Pretty quick, when we get them.&#x0022; The papers of the burned prizes are all kept and a valuation is made before the destruction of the vessels, in the expectation that when peace is restored the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> will make an appropriation of money equivalent to the claims of the captors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In consequence of this arrangement there is very little actual treasure on board the <rs type="ship">Florida</rs>, and the officers and crew are working mainly on the faith of the future independence and solvency of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. &#x0022;Anyway,&#x0022; said <persName n="Maffit,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Maffit,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Maffit</surname></persName>, &#x0022;we have cost the <rs>Government</rs> very little, for we've lived on the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> In reply to some questions as to the method of capture the captain said, &#x0022;We only make war with the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Most of those whom we have captured have spoken well of us. To be sure we have met with some ungrateful rascals, <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> but you meet with these all the world over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>In its object this State paper is certainly intelligible.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> The truth is, the course of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war has taken us by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>When we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrived at the conclusion that the <rs>South</rs> could never be coerced into reunion at the point of the sword we still anticipated prompt military success on the part of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The only reserve affecting our judgment was a doubt about the earnestness and unanimity of the <rs>South</rs> in claiming independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>That condition being satisfied, we considered that though <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of men were certainly stronger than <num value="9000000">nine millions</num>, <hi rend="italics">they were not so much stronger as to have any chance of subjugating these <num value="9000000">nine millions</num>, dispersed as they were over an almost illimitable territory.</hi> We hardly doubted the immediate superiority of the <rs>North</rs> in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The general expectation of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> was that the <rs>South</rs> would soon be overrun, that its seaports would be all captured and occupied, and that strong Federal garrisons would hold its chief towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>In short, we anticipated that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, or at any rate the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war, would see the prostration of the <rs>Confederates</rs> thus far completed; but it was then that we thought the hopelessness of the work would begin to be left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> If at that time we could have foreseen that the successes of the <rs>North</rs> after more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of desperate fighting would amount only to the achievements now recounted with so much complacency by <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, we should have thought the task of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> more impracticable than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> The Federals thought to sweep the <rs>Southern States</rs> with their irresistible forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>All that can be said at this moment of Northern exultation is that the <rs>Federals</rs> have taken <num value="2">two</num> places on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> after sieges <num value="3">three</num> times as tedious and as costly as they were expected to be, and that they have not had their own capital occupied by the enemy, as seemed highly probable <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> ago.--<persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, while coloring his history as favorably as he can, is compelled to talk of drawn battles as events creditable to the <rs>Federal</rs> arms; and the very paper which is designed to show the unquestionable ascendancy of the <rs>North</rs> speaks of the &#x0022;necessity of covering the national capital,&#x0022; and the absolute equality of the belligerent forces in its immediate vicinity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>This, however, was not the case, and we are therefore not much impressed with the moderate balance of success which <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName><surname>Seward</surname></persName> claims for his own side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>In point of fact, taking <num value="1">one</num> field with another, the <rs>South</rs> has had a greater share of victory than the <rs>North</rs> its only conspicuous failure, indeed, was in an attempt to bring the war to a close by the capture of the <rs>Northern</rs> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>This is not much of a case for a Power pretending so distinctly to superiority as to complain that the character of a belligerent is accorded to its rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>On that point, indeed, let any <num value="1">one</num> read <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s own descriptions, in this very document, of the strength, the numbers, and the bearing of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, and then say if the <rs>South</rs> be not entitled to the designation of a belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Why, in recording the <rs n="Battle of Antietam" type="battle">battle of Antietam</rs>, the <rs>Federal Secretary</rs> is actually compelled to expatiate on the identical qualities of the contending forces, and to add that the <rs>Northern</rs> soldiers were then proved, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time; to be not inferior in heroism and valor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Practically, then, <hi rend="italics">the very gist and essence of <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s argument is fatal to its object.</hi>--If all is true that he tells us, that all is infinitely short of what we were prepared to take for granted <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, without being any the more sanguine of Northern success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We only conclude from this that the <rs>Federals</rs> have not even that superiority for which we gave them credit; <sic>and</sic> and that the relative strength of the <rs>Confederates</rs> is by so much the greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>But he shows neither of these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>On the contrary, he tells us that the <rs>Southern President</rs> has just proclaimed all evy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>, while of his own Government he says nothing, except that it is preparing to prosecute the war as before.

For the relief of such doubters, we are happy to announce that <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> is defensible only against an enemy on the opposite side of the river.
