<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We have already laid before our readers an account of the passage of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> by the enemy on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, and the fighting which ensued is and around the town of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It was anticipated by those unfamiliar with the time required to manoeuvre and place in position large bodies of troops, that a general engagement between the <num value="2">two</num> armies would take place on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This expectation was disappointed, and the fight of that day amounted to little more than preliminary skirmishing for position, most of the firing being on the part of the slowly advancing columns of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Before nightfall the firing ceased, and by all parties it was believed that the issue would be fully joined at daydawn on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. With this view the <orgName>divisions of <persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName></orgName> and <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName> (the latter commanded by <persName n="Barly,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Barly,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Barly</surname></persName>) were ordered up from the extreme right in the direction of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName>, and about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> took position to the west of the railroad, and near <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName>'s crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Before there arrival, however, our line of battle had been formed &mdash; the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> consisting of <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="Tallaferro's Division"><persName n="Tallaferro,Division,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Tallaferro,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Division"></roleName><surname>Tallaferro</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName>, and the left and centre formed by the <orgName>divisions of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName></orgName>'s <orgName n="corps">corps</orgName>, and extending to within <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The line was nearly a semi &mdash; circle, and reached about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> from the extreme left to the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> About <time value="9.5oclock">9&#x00BD; o'clock</time> the booming of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun was heard at <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName>'s Turnout, away off to the left, in the direction of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In a short time the excessive reports of artillery told unmistakably that the ball was opening, and along the whole line of the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> the troops buckled on their armors for the conflict before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>As the morning were on, and the fog which had partially obscured the light was lifted from the earth, the cannonading became more general, until about <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time>, when what had before been but an occasional report became an uninterrupted roar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>So general was this cannonade that an unpracticed ear could scarce distinguish the report of our own from the guns of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> About <time value="1pm">1 o'clock P. M.</time>, the long black columns of the enemy, in regular order, were observed moving up from their position near the river, in the direction of our batteries on the hill side, <num value="3">three</num>--<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile in advance of <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName>'s crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>As they moved across the wide valley, stretching along between the river and the railroad, <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries away off to the right opened upon them <unclear></unclear> which was kept up until the head of their columns had reached the woods in which our <unclear></unclear> was formed, when the sharp crack of infantry, fix at intervals and then in volleys quickly succeeding each other, was heard and observed from the surrounding hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At this time the fight at this ports had become general and very severe, both <unclear></unclear> contesting the ground with more than usual obstinacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Here and to the left of the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>, the battle raged for perhaps an hour, our troops engaged being <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName> and a portion of Barly's and Tallaferro's forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Meanwhile, the enemy's columns were observed to falter, and presently to recede, when it very soon became evident that the fire was too warm for them, and that they were yielding and gradually giving way, as our own forces pressed on. For a distance of about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> they were followed by our men, who then withdrew from the pursuit, and retired to the west side of the railroad, in the woods where the line was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Later in the afternoon, the enemy renewed the attack, which was met with such spirit that it was but finally sustained, and they soon full back in the direction of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This <unclear></unclear> the heavy fighting on the right of the line, and the battle was principally fought and won by the troops of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, aided at times by the other troops of <placeName reg="Jackson, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002268">Jackson</placeName>'s corps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Whilst these operations were going on <sic>on</sic> the right, <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> was hotly engaged with the enemy on the left, immediately in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The right of the enemy's line was formed a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> from the southern limits of the town, and our forces confronting them were posted on a range of hills about half a mile distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The fighting at this point was very heavy, and continued throughout the afternoon, during the whole of which time our position was maintained without a reverse, and late in the day the enemy were signally repulsed and driven back into the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We were informed that <orgName n="McLawe's Division"><persName n="McLawe,Division,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:McLawe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Division"></roleName><surname>McLawe</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> sustained the principal shock of battle on this end of the line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> When darkness drew on the firing of small arms cased, and the stillness of the night was only occasionally interrupted by the report of heavy-guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The result of the day's bloody work is easily summed up. At every point of attack the enemy were effectually repulsed, and at night our forces slept on their arms on the ground occupied by them in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The number of prisoners taken during the day is variously estimated from <num value="600">600</num> to <num value="1000">1,000</num> and we think will reach the latter figure.--Among these are a number of minor officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In conversation with <num value="1">one</num> of them &mdash; a man of more than ordinary intelligence &mdash; he stated that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s forces did not exceed <num value="100000">100,000</num> men, and that no confidence is felt among the troops that they will be successful in the straggle now in progress, and which resulted with such decided advantage to our arms on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He says, that at no time since the war commenced has there been a more despondent feeling among their troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> expressed himself as highly gratified with the result of the previous day's work.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> While the committee believe that the efforts referred to have not yet pervaded the community at large, the tone and spirit of certain articles in a portion of the public press, the misrepresentation and perversion of facts, the biassed addresses of many men of influence, all with the manifest tendency to bespeak favor for those who are contending for the extension and consolidation of slavery, and to disparage and discourage efforts directed to its extinction, impress the committee with the painful conviction that in some quarters a demoralizing effect has been produced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> The committee deplore and regard with profound grief the fratricidal conflict between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>; but, while anxious to avoid expressing any opinion likely to be construed into an approval of a war policy, they regard it as established beyond disproof that the <rs>South</rs> was not only the aggressor, but designedly provoked an armed contest with the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>On the other hand, the <orgName n="U. S.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> Lastly, the <rs>President</rs> has lately issued a proclamation declaring absolutely and forever free all the slaves in those States which shall be in rebellion on the <date value="01-01">1st of January</date> next, and pointing to the measures in progress for the abolition of slavery in the loyal States upon the principle of indemnification. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> While the committee deprecate a resort to arms, even with the avowed purpose of promoting the extinction of slavery, they reiterate the opinion that the friends of the slave in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under whatsoever designation, have established a just claim upon the sympathy of the friends of freedom throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> In this spirit, and with the object of evoking such an expression of sympathy as shall encourage the emancipation party in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in their most difficult position, to persevere in their endeavors to obtain justice for the slave, the committee issue the present address, earnestly commending it to the favorable consideration of their fellow-countrymen and to the friends of humanity in all lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>This may be owing to the fact that, on account of its very difficulty it is rarely attempted without good hope of success.--The necessity of subdividing the force and disposing it over an extended line, is of course an element of weakness for the defensive, while, if the line should not be thus guarded, the force would all the time be exposed to flank and rear assaults from the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> Depend upon it, the rebel leaders are sensible of all the weakness, as well as of all the strength, of their position at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>; and you may at any time expect to learn that they have taken advantage of the opportunities before the operations of <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> are fully developed, to retreat, ere retreat is rendered perilous or impossible.--They have already derived from their occupancy all the benefit it is capable to afford them; they have delayed the army here now nearly <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, which is triumph enough for <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>As soon as they find themselves seriously exposed to a flank movement which will bring us on their rear, they will hasten to evacuate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Indeed, we know that already their chief force is not at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> itself, but at <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio" key="tgn,7013448">Bowling Green</placeName>, <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> South of that place &mdash; and which you will observe to be significantly placed with relation to the roads leading obliquely South from what you will perceive, from a topographical study of the map, to be the most available point of an assault from this place. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> There is, therefore, good reason to hope that <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> &mdash; indispensable to us as a depot of supplies for hospital accommodations, &#x0026;c.--will yet fall into our hands without any fatal encounter.
