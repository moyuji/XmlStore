<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>To day we copy additional sketches of these highly animated and not unamusing displays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>It was quite remarkable that the <rs>Speaker</rs> thought it necessary that he should descend from the chair and initiate the proceeding which caused the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>He was handled pretty roughly for it, as he deserved.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> The tendency of the debate, if debate it could be called, was quite remarkable.--There was a boldness in asserting sentiments hostile to the war and the <name>Administration</name>, that proves either a growing resolution or increased strength and confidence in the opposition pasty; and, perhaps, both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>This vote was upon a motion to lay upon the table a preamble and resolution offered by <persName n="Fink,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00348" reg="mostcommon:Fink,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fink</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, declaring that &#x0022;the army and navy cannot be rightfully and lawfully used to subjugate and hold as conquered territory any of the <name>States</name> of this Union,&#x0022; and &#x0022;that this war should not be urged on our part in any spirit of conquest or subjugation, nor for any purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of the <name>States</name>, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and to preserve the <rs>Union</rs>, with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and as soon as these objects are attained the war ought to cease.&#x0022; A motion was made to lay the preamble and resolution on the table, and this prevailed by <unclear></unclear> to <num value="64">64</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>It is not improbable that there is a gradual extension over the <rs>Northern</rs> mind of the idea that whatever be the condition of the <rs>South</rs> after the war, in case the <rs>North</rs> triumph, to that condition also must the <rs>North</rs> subside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>If it is held as a conquered province and ruled by a despotic authority, then that authority must be despotic everywhere, and the <rs>North</rs>, as well as the <rs>South</rs>, be under its dominion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>There are increasing signs of late that this apprehension is spreading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>It is a just <num value="1">one</num>; but nevertheless loss <num value="1">one</num> of those just ideas which are slow to prevail in opposition to a Government with a large army and navy and unlimited means to back it. Nor should we infer that were the party now supporting this idea, in power, it would materially change the manner of the war. To bolster up its power and attain its ends it would consider any means justifiable, and would become so embittered against that brave people who would give them so much trouble by resistance as to think any punishment or calamity they might bring upon themselves well merited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Resisting <persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00349" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his myrmidous is not so horrible in their estimation; but to resist them were they in power would be quite another and much more serious affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>To fight <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00350" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who boldly tells us to what abject degradation he means to reduce us, is natural; but to resist these States--rights men, with their promise to secure to the <rs>Southern States</rs> all their &#x0022;dignity, equality, and rights unimpaired,&#x0022; would be an obduracy so monstrous and aggravating, as really after all to entitle the <rs>South</rs> to no better fate than that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00351" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had prepared for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It might not be so; but there is in human nature such facility of change of policy and of principle to suit a change of circumstances, that we need not place much faith in any predominating party at the <rs>North--State</rs> rights nor any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>If there is in <hi rend="italics">human nature</hi> a weakness where self is concerned, an infirmity of inclination to interest in despite of principle, how much greater is that weakness, that infirmity, in <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nature?</hi> Still, let us take what pleasure we can in these feuds of our enemies, hoping at least that there is sincerity and honesty amongst those who are opposing the tyranny and barbarism of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, and feeling assured that the indomitable bravery of the soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> and the triumphs of Southern arms will embolden their opposition and still further divide the counsels of the inhuman Government now plotting the subjugation and denationalization of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> But to return to the subject of the expulsion: In the course of the debate <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wood,Mister,Fernando,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00352" reg="default:Wood,Fernando,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Fernando</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName></hi> suggested that it would be better before expelling <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Long,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00353" reg="mostcommon:Long,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Long</surname></persName></hi> to recur to what he did say; and read from the manuscript copy of the speech, prepared several weeks before it was delivered, the following passages &#x0022;I now believe that there are but <num value="2">two</num> alternatives &mdash; either an acknowledgment of the <rs>South</rs> as an independent nation, or their complete subjugation and extermination as a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Of these alternatives I prefer the former.&#x0022; The reading of this passage occasioned a pause in the proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>The satanic subjugationists were placed in a dilemma.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>They would be forced to expel <persName n="Long,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00354" reg="mostcommon:Long,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Long</surname></persName> for preferring recognition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to the entire destruction of every man, woman and child in the <rs>South</rs>, or abandon the prosecution.--So they laid over the subject to see what the official report in the <hi rend="italics">Globe</hi> would make Mr. L. say. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/> Nevertheless, while the fate of <num value="1">one</num> victim was thus necessarily delayed, possibly averted, another presented himself in the person of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Harris,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00355" reg="mostcommon:Harris,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, who stood up to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Long,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00356" reg="mostcommon:Long,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Long</surname></persName></hi> &#x0022;through thick and thin.&#x0022; Nay, he went farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He declared as follows:--The South ask you to leave them in peace; but no, you say you will bring them into subjection &mdash; that is not done yet, and <hi rend="italics"><name n="God" type="God">God</name> Almighty great that it may not be.</hi> I hope you never will subjugate the <rs>South</rs>.&#x0022; <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> H. said a great many other strong things&#x0022;among them that &#x0022;a braver set of men never existed on <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> earth than exists at the <rs>South</rs>;&#x0022; and that he would not consent that the money of the nation &#x0022;should be spent by a tyrant; &#x0022; &#x0022;not a man nor a dollar would no vote for this infernal war,&#x0022; &#x0026;c. But the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> passage quoted above from the defiant <persName n="Marylander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="mostcommon:Marylander,nomatch:0"><surname>Marylander</surname></persName> (&#x0022;there is life in the old State <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> yet!&#x0022;) was ordered to be written down by the clerk, and <num value="1">one</num> of those <hi rend="italics">brother blackguards,</hi>&#x0022;the <hi rend="smallcaps">Washburnes</hi> &#x0022;moved <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Harris,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00358" reg="mostcommon:Harris,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>'s</hi> expulsion including for so great an offender <unclear></unclear> short skill the vote was immediately taken, and resulted ayes <num value="81">81</num>, noes <num value="58">58</num>--not a <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num></hi> vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>So <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> H. was not expelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The strategy was then changed, and it was moved by <persName n="Schenck,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="mostcommon:Schenck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Schenck</surname></persName>, (more appropriately <hi rend="italics">Skunk,</hi>) of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, that <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> H. was &#x0022;an unworthy member of this <name>House</name>, and is &#x0022;hereby severely censured.&#x0022; We cannot but suppose that the gallant <rs>Harris</rs> took this terrible judgment as a compliment!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>It is evident that the is in the wrong place &mdash; he is too noble a man to herd with such animals as now compose the representative body of Yankeedom in the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>He is as unworthy of association with them as would be an honest man with a band of robbers, or a gentleman with a set of scurvy blackguards and knaves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> We repeat, the occurrences to which we have alluded are significant of an emboldened sentiment of opposition to the tyranny and brutality of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The rapid strides it has made to its imperious and overshadowing power &mdash; a complete despotism &mdash; and the danger that it will be permanent, are exciting a growing uneasiness and apprehension in the <rs>Northern</rs> public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>This tendency of public feeling has been stimulated, no doubt, by the course of the campaigns opened so unfortunately for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the present year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>A few more reverses will spread the flames rapidly, and there is no telling what startling events may not ensue within the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The futile war &mdash; the <rs>Federal</rs> finances, which are growing daily more desperate &mdash; the despair of making the <rs>South</rs> pay the enormous <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> debt &mdash; must produces political and social convulsions among a people who are too selfish to submit to an adversity they may check, too avaricious to endure pecuniary rain in a hopeless cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Let us hope that such convulsions are not remote, and that they may come with all the force these causes can give them, and with as much severity as may be merited by the rapacious and heartless people upon whom they must fall. </p> </div3>
