<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>At other periods the <rs>French</rs> enjoyed comparative repose, while engaged in blockading Mantna. </p>

<head>Spirit rations for the army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> We were surprised to hear a few days ago from an old soldier that spirit rations are not served out to the men in our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>In our opinion, this accounts in some measure for the ravages of disease and of death in our rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>A small quantity of whiskey twice a day is almost essential to the health of men who undergo such exposures and hardships as those of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Especially is this the case where the men are unable to procure coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Coffee is a great stimulant and invigorator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>In the <rs>French</rs> army it is greatly in use, and perhaps deserves no little credit for some great victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>In the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army the men have regular spirit and coffee rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It is rather hard that our brave fellows should have neither, and be obliged to contend against superior numbers besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>This great omission ought at once to be rectified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>There ought to be whiskey enough in the country to supply an army as large as that of <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName> for a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We had supposed when the sale of whiskey was prohibited to citizens and to soldiers in cities, <num value="1">one</num> object was to preserve the supply, which, in moderate quantities, is highly important for the fighting man. It was right and proper to keep whiskey out of the hands of those who would use it for evil purposes, and to prevent soldiers who are off duty from drinking to excess; but a wine glass full twice a day to a man who is digging ditches from sunrise till sunset, and sleeping on the wet ground at night, or standing guard in the winter snows till his feet are frozen to the ground &mdash; as repeatedly happened to our sentries last winter &mdash; is a very different matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It is a thing, under such circumstances, of almost absolute necessity, and the quality being regulated by army rules, excess is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>We have heard that old <persName><foreName>Stonewall</foreName></persName> says that, though he never drinks himself, nothing does him more good than to see his men refreshing themselves with the modest allowance which is contained in the spirit ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>This snows the practical good sense and discrimination of this valuable officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>He does not tickle his own palate with wines, and then withhold whiskey rations from his soldiers; but, on the contrary, whilst he denies himself, has no desire to make his own abstinence a rule for everybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Nothing can be more horrible and disgusting than intemperance, and an army of drunkards would make short work with any cause committed to their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>We should be glad indeed if whiskey were put out of the reach of every man, citizen or soldier, who has not the virtue of self control, but that should not lead us to deprive men of a prescribed moderate quantity, who are performing such extraordinary labors as those required of the soldier. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> The weather yesterday morning being unusually beautiful and inviting, it was universally believed that military operations of some kind would take place along our lines; and the loud reports of ordnance heard near the centre of our position, early in the day, seemed to corroborate the general rumor.--Upon enquiry, however, we learned that an <orgName n="Artillery Company" type="company">artillery company</orgName> had simply been amusing itself by shelling the enemy out of the woods and trying their range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>This sentiment is universal in all branches of the service, and doubtless fully known to those commanding. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/> We are extremely glad to see such strictness enforced by our commanders, and trust that the boast of some are not true, viz: <q>&#x0022;That little difficulty is experienced in passing to and fro at right, for the guard are either too lazy or careless to carefully examine passes presented to them,&#x0022;</q> &#x0026;c.
