<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The debate in Congress Wednesday is interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In the <name>Senate</name>, <persName n="Wigfall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Wigfall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wigfall</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, made a warm speech, in which he said: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> If the people of the <rs>North</rs> desire it, this Union can be saved; but this Union is not to be saved by flattery, either on the floor of the <name>Senate</name> or from the stump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>You cannot save the <rs>Union</rs> by singing hosannas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>You cannot save it by making <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> speeches.--You have got to come down to the work and do something practically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The people of the different slaveholding States, especially the <rs>Cotton States</rs>, are dissatisfied with the present government as about to be administered by the incoming Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There is nothing that can satisfy them except by amending the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and these amendments must be made by the <rs>Northern States</rs> unanimously, or they will not be satisfied, and I say here they ought not to be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> which would secure us everything we ask, were ratified by <num value="15">fifteen</num> slave and <num value="10">ten</num> non-slaveholding States, it would be considered part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; but if <num value="8">eight</num> non-slave States vote against it, and yet its ratification made it a part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, we would say at once here were amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> which were distasteful to <num value="8">eight</num> non-slaveholding States, and which they would probably disregard, as they disregard the present Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Suppose that amendments were proposed, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> slave States ratify them; suppose, also, that the non-slaveholding States ratify them, but that New York, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs>, and other border States, refuse ratification, why, what practical use would they be to use?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>None. What is the use of discussing what we would be satisfied with, when nothing has been offered us?--What is the use, when we do not believe we will be permitted to retain the <rs>Senators</rs> we now have? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> deny that under the <rs>Constitution</rs> slaves are recognized as property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If we could believe they would go to their constituents and urge the ratification of proper amendments, we believe the <rs>Gull States</rs> would suspend their action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Certainly so, if the amendments be carried out in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If they will cease preaching the irrepressible conflict doctrine and declare slaves to be property, that they shall be delivered up when claimed as fugitives, that abolition societies shall be abolished and abolition presses be suppressed, that abolition speeches shall no longer be made, and that we shall not have pirates and murderers sent among our women and children, when such an honest effort is made to meet the demands of the <rs>South</rs>, there is a prospect of giving them a fair consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>[Roars of laughter from the galleries and the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>.] He continued, saying &mdash; <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> may laugh in our faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>[Renewed laughter from the whole house.] My friends from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and other Union-saving friends may look and see derision depicted in their countenances when I make this proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>[Laughter.] I trust they will understand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The Latin maxim says, &#x0022;Learn, even from your enemies, some wisdom.&#x0022; I have told the people whom I represent, long, long ago, that they will not be permitted to keep that which they have now; that they are regarded as poltroons, and that you talk of coercion, and of binding this <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName>, as you call it, with cords of hemp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Yet you petition that his <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName> shall continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Stop with in your borders those flaming presses and public speakers who excite the people against us I say to those States that you <hi rend="italics">shall not</hi>-- that's the word I choose to use, and I represent the feeling and determination of the people I represent &mdash; I say you <hi rend="italics">shall not</hi> permit men to excite your citizens by making <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> speeches and bringing <hi rend="italics">strychnine</hi> within the limits of the <rs>State</rs> I represent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> You <hi rend="italics">shall not</hi> publish newspapers and pamphlets to excite our slaves to insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>You <hi rend="italics">shall not</hi> publish newspapers and pamphlets to excite our slaveholders against the slave, or slaveholder against non-slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We will have peace, and if you do not offer it to us, we will quietly have our rights under the constitutional compact or withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> and establish a government for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If you then persist in aggression, these sovereign States will settle the question, and when you laugh at these impotent efforts, little as you regard them, I tell you emphatically that Cotton is <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>[Laughter, and some applause in the galleries.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> said the Sergeant-at-Arms will clear the galleries if it occurs again. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I trust the <name>Senate</name> will act upon t-- decency is looked for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I think we attach too much importance to the expression of the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I take it for granted that those warned yesterday did not repeat it. Yesterday there was <num value="1">one</num> set, to-day there is a new set. We will get them all instructed after a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>[Laughter from <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> <persName n="Wigfall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Wigfall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wigfall</surname></persName> resumed &mdash; I say Cotton is <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>, and that cotton waves his sceptre not only over <num value="33">thirty-three</num> States, but over the <rs>Island</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and over Continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> There is no crowned head, either upon that Island or Continent, that does not bend the knee in fear, and acknowledge allegiance to that power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><num value="5000000">Five millions</num> of people in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> live upon cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>You may make short crops of grain, and they can husband their supply, but exhaust the supply of cotton <num value="1">one</num> week, and all <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will starve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They will not burst open barns, but burn whole towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We can direct the trade of <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num> to our own ports instead of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and New York, if we go out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>What tariff we will accept I expect to know in a few months, and in another chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>[Laughter in the galleries.] You suppose numbers constitute the strength of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I tell you that it is the almighty dollar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> When your operatives are turned out; when your capitalists are broken, will you go to direct taxation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>When you cease to have exports will you have imports?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Your factories will then be burnt down; your capitalists will go to the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I know you do not regard us in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I would save the <rs>Union</rs> if I could, but it is my deliberate impression &mdash; and I have been studying the character of the people you represent for years past &mdash; that it cannot be saved. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>His sympathies were as broad as the atmosphere which surrounds the <rs>Globe</rs> &mdash; they embraced the whole human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>His actions were confined to <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> &mdash; his example was a pattern for the <name>Imitation</name> of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>He found us a few scattered colonies, divided in sentiment, separated by vast distances, engaged in different pursuits, bound together only by the ties of a common language and a common origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>He left us a united nation, enjoying unrivalled prosperity, united by the sufferings and triumphs of a long and successful war, growing in population at a gigantic pace, with a glorious record and an unclouded future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>And it was all his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It was he who had guided our counsels in the closet, and directed our armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It was he who had led us to victory, and enabled us to gather the fruits of our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>His aspirations, his hopes, his exertions, were all for the well-being of the nation he had founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>For himself, he asked nothing, not even that envy, hatred and all uncharitableness should spare his name when he was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>He left his character behind him, and asked no man to spare it. He bid defiance to calumny while alive, and could no more be moved out of his path by censure, than the sun can be turned from its course by being told that it is the fountain of darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>He seems not to have cared whether anything at <hi rend="italics">all</hi> was said of him, and if said, whether it might be good or bad. All he ever aimed at, when in the plenitude of power, was to do what he considered to be his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>That done, his own mind was easy, and he was indifferent to the opinion of the world. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> was the wisest <hi rend="italics">uninspired</hi> man that ever lived. &#x0022;What,&#x0022; says the critic, &#x0022;<hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> the wisest of men, and the republic he established gone to pieces, like a stranded ship, in <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure>!&#x0022; Certainly!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>He was but a man, after all, although the wisest of his species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>He is said to have entertained in his inmost soul a distrust of man's capacity to govern himself, notwithstanding he hoped for the best, and did everything that man could do to ensure the success of the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>He foresaw the dangers to which it would be exposed &mdash; he pointed out the breakers that lay in its path &mdash; and he implored his countrymen to avoid them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Demagogues and sectional animosities, he foresaw, would be the ruin of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>He told his countrymen to beware of them, and it was all he could do.--Was he not a prophet, as well as a wise man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Did he not foretell, <measure n="65years" type="date">sixty-five years</measure> ago, the very state of things which now exists?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>What has brought us to our present condition &mdash; what has broken this republic into fragments, but demagogues spouting poison at every cross road, and sectional jealousies the food from which the venom is supplied?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The republic was like the cedar of <placeName reg="Lebanon, Russell, Virginia" key="tgn,2112632">Lebanon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Its height pierced the clouds; its branches overshadowed the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>All the nations of the earth found rest under its shadow; all the fowls of the air built their nests in its branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It is humiliating to think that it has not been torn from the roots by a whirlwind, or felled to the earth by the axe of the woodman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>It is already sapless and dead &mdash; it is about to come to the earth &mdash; the nations will send up a cry of despair when it comes down, for it carries with it the last hope of oppressed man. There will be joy in <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, and shouts of laughter in all the despotisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Its ruin is due to the filthy worms called demagogues, who have been boring into its trunk, penetrating its roots, consuming its vitality, and blasting its verdure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> It is a great pity our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> brethren are so very good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>It is a great pity that they are so utterly unselfish &mdash; that they should so entirely neglect the means of their own eternal salvation, and devote themselves so entirely to the eternal salvation of other people &mdash; that they should feel a calling to preach against other people's sins, and should not concern themselves about their own. It is a pity, too, that the light of the gospel should be confined to that land, or carried abroad only by its missionaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It is the greatest pity of all, that they should feel themselves <hi rend="italics">called</hi> to force their opinions upon all flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>They boast of being descended from the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We should think this boast was not altogether idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The family resemblance is certainly very strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>What their fathers did for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, they now seek to do for us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>We should think they ought to be satisfied with these exploits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Such is not the fact, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>They know what true religion is better than anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>They know better than our Saviour himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>He passed his whole life among slaves, and he said nothing against slaveholding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>He denounced every other sin, but this he passed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are great improvers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>They improve even upon the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>They have discovered that slaveholding is a sin, or as they term it, after <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Wesley</foreName></persName>,</hi> &#x0022;the sum of all villainies.&#x0022; True, they make fortunes out of the product of slave labor; but it is allowable to the <name>Saints</name> to eat of the fat and drink of the strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Having no sins of their own, they feel themselves called to attend to the condition of Southern souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Forthwith demagogues all over <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> begin a crusade against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The South has her demagogues, too, and deep answers to deep until the passions of the <num value="2">two</num> sections become so inflamed against each other, that there is no such thing as living any longer together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> And all this <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> foresaw, and all this he warned us against. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>We adhere to the opinion, often expressed in this paper, that now is the time to settle up finally and forever the slavery question &mdash; in the <rs>Union</rs>, if it can be done; otherwise, out of it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/> We are fully of opinion, as we have often said, that a respectable and powerful minority in the <rs>Northern States</rs> will be true to the <rs>South</rs> if the <rs>South</rs> will be true to itself, and stand together in a compact phalanx.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>This minority, with a united South, can easily demoralize and break up the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> phalanx, which is composed of materials as incongruous as those of the image in <hi rend="smallcaps">Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Already, the fear of losing the fleshpots at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> has caused some of them to renounce their run-mad abolitionism, and whole droves will follow in the same track as soon as their eyes are opened to the dangers which threaten their interests.--Now, while their ranks are shaking, the <rs>Southern</rs> column, if it were consolidated as <num value="1">one</num> man, could split them like a wedge, and scatter them, never to be re-united.
