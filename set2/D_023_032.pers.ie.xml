<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The measure proposed by our chivalrous and forbearing Government is mild in contrast with the brutal rigors of the brutal and cowardly Northern, <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, who are hounding on their unscrupulous and beastly soldiery to devastate the land and insult and outrage our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The day of retribution must come, and we trust it will not long be delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>That day will be when we are enabled to cross the line and return the desolation to those who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> spread it broadcast amongst us. Then let the poisoned chalice be commended to appropriate lips &mdash; let the angel of desolation hover over the people who have prayed and fought that we should be plunged in misery and woe &mdash; and let no forbearing hand check the tide of retribution until the cry for mercy comes from the persecutor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>And not then until be gives proof of his humiliation by abandoning his war and giving the <rs>South</rs> peace on honorable and just terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Retribution. retribution, must be the watchword of the <rs>South</rs> and we should never rest until it is visited with full and overrunning measure upon the robbers and murders who are now infesting our country. </p> </div3>
