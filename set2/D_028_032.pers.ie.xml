<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> In yesterday's <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> we published the late legislation of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress abolishing slavery, and the scenes attending its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The proposition which that body has passed is for the incorporation into the <rs>Constitution</rs> of an amendment ordaining that &#x0022;neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.&#x0022;In order to be incorporated in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the amendment must be ratified by a majority in each House of the <name>Legislatures</name> of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <num value="36">thirty-six</num> States belonging to the <rs>Union</rs>, of which (the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> having <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> States) there can be no doubt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> If we had ever doubted that this was <num value="1">one</num> of their Revolutions, not designed to go backward, if we had ever harbored a suspicion that reconstruction of the old Union was within the limits of possibility, or that a beneficent Heaven had led us forth from the land of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> only to return to the dominion of <persName><foreName>Pharaoh</foreName></persName>, the crowning consummation of the <name>Abolition</name> triumph has set at rest forever this idle and unworthy thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The hand of Heaven has written on the wall the eternal separation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and no Confederate man will longer even desire to join together that which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> hath put asunder. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We assure them that it did not come a moment too soon; that it is not in any way too stringent or too sweeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We look upon it as the manifest hand of Heaven interposed in the very way, and at the very hour, that our condition required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is a greater boon to us than a grand victory in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We echo back the shouts of delight that rang through the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We should like to see gun for gun fired with their frantic population in honor of the event, only that we wish to save our gunpowder and give them shotted salutes on the battle-field.

Do they see the difference between men and children?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If we do not now ring all our bells, fire all our cannon, sing <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Deum,,Te,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Deum,Te,,,"><foreName>Te</foreName> <surname>Deum</surname></persName></hi> in all our churches, it is not because there is no music, joy and gratitude in our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> It was but a few days ago that the military organ of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> conceded that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> could not be subjugated by simple force; that it was upon the overthrow of its &#x0022;will,&#x0022; of its &#x0022;moral Strength,&#x0022; that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> relied for its conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If ever there was a time when its &#x0022;will&#x0022; was weakened, or its &#x0022;moral Strength&#x0022; decayed,--thanks to that Abolition Congress &mdash; thanks to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s reply to our commissioners &mdash; it stands now upon a Gibraltar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Henceforth the most sordid spirit in the whole Confederacy will not dream of reconstruction; the veriest poltroon will be brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The dream of a re-united country will vanish even from lunatic asylums, and every eye will see in the face from which the <rs>Federal</rs> mask has been dropped by itself the undisguised features of the <name>Thug</name> and the <name>Devil</name>.--They will have our property, our lands, our lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Will they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The United Sates Congress has abolished <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We could laugh at their folly, if gratitude for the service they have rendered us did not forbid us to treat our benefactors with irreverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Why did they not abolish it in <placeName key="tgn,1000160" n="1.000 1" reg="benin">Dahomey</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Why do they not command the sea to stand still, and say to the ocean, &#x0022;Thus far shalt thou come, and no further?&#x0022; Our very slaves will teach them to respect their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Let them make good their laws by deeds instead of words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We are going to resist them henceforth as <num value="1">one</num> man, and to defend our hearthstones and our lives as men do who have no hope but in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and in their own right arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The &#x0022;moral strength&#x0022; of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is this day restored as by a miracle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Those concessions are made, be it remembered, in the face of those successes which have caused such croaking and despondency among the nervous and dyspeptic of our own people, after the defeat of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 4" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName>, the triumph, by overwhelming odds, at <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> We have never been of those who denied the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the qualities of courage and soldiership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We conceded them those common capacities of all male animals before the war, but we have seen nothing in the war which gives us any new light on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>They have everywhere fought us at odds of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, and often been defeated even with such odds in their favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We need not even assume, what we believe, that the <rs>South</rs> are a more military people than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, or any other race of men.-- We attribute our success, under the favor of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, to the &#x0022;moral strength&#x0022; of a people fighting on their own soil, and for their own firesides, against that &#x0022;moral weakness&#x0022; of invaders and aggressors which no ordinary preponderance of numbers can make strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>With those conditions in our favor, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> may wage this warfare till the crack of doom, and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> can never be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Our enemies see this as plainly as we do ourselves, though we had scarcely imagined <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> they would have the honesty to confess it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> We have <num value="1">one</num> word to say to the croakers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>: If you want to give up the contest, meet, like men, in public assemblies, and say so; but do not paralyze the army with your long faces and deep groans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Do not come from your comfortable dwellings well spread boards and luxurious beds, and chant lamentations to those hopeful heroes who stand in your front, and have endured in your defence such perils and privations as have rarely fallen to the lot of humanity since the beginning of the world.
