<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> The foreign imports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at the port of New York for <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> from the <dateStruct value="-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> are reported at <measure n="148460318dollars" type="currency">$148,460,318</measure>. The exports for the same time amounted to <measure n="114173395dollars" type="currency">$114,173,395</measure>, against same months preceding year <measure n="136425844dollars" type="currency">$136,425,844</measure>, showing a decrease in exports of <measure n="22252449dollars" type="currency">$22,252,449</measure> in <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> of the present fiscal year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>For the same time there is an increase in imports of <measure n="17046608dollars" type="currency">$17,046,608</measure>, and the imports exceed the exports for the same <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> by the large sum of <measure n="29286923dollars" type="currency">$29,286,923</measure>. This is a heavy balance against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at <num value="1">one</num> <placeName reg="Custom-House">Custom-House</placeName> at a time like the present, and must be met by the cash in specie; and yet it appears the specie exports from New York have fallen off in the <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure>, as compared with the year preceding, <measure n="6041000dollars" type="currency">$6,041,000</measure>. The matter is explained by the fact that the <rs>California</rs> gold, or the great bulk of it, is now exported in <name>British</name> vessels directly to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> pay for their imports by drawing upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> It is certainly not an encouraging fact to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that their exports are so much in deficit of their imports at a time when their resources are so tremendously taxed to carry on the war upon the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will hardly allow them to enlarge their credits with her, for in prospective they have nothing wherewith to pay their debt, in case they fail to conquer the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>So they must continue to pay up their balance in hard money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Nor is this the most serious drain upon them, as would be found if the veil of private transactions between the <rs>Northern</rs> and <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> ports &mdash; or Northern merchants and foreign bankers &mdash; could be lifted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It would be found that hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of shoddy and other sharpers who have amassed fortunes out of the war have made and are now making special deposits in safe places beyond the <rs>Atlantic</rs> which must come upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>If <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> were to-morrow to let out his <measure n="30000000dollars" type="currency">$30,000,000</measure> of gold in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address>, in order to reduce the premium on gold and temporarily to bolster up the credit of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, the greater part of it, if not the whole, would find its way to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> The Confederacy and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are girding up their loins for what bids fair to be the most decisive struggle of the war.--The enemy who, for <num value="3">three</num> long years, has persecuted us with a malice which seems to have been kindled in the lowest flames of hell; who has subjected our prisoners in his hands to horrors which make the blood run cold; whose track across our country may be traced by dwellings burned down and desolated fields; who openly proclaims his purpose to rob us of all we have on earth, and reduce our whole population to the condition of beggars and slaves, is about to make <num value="1">one</num> more mighty effort to crush us to the earth, and render our land as desolate and miserable as the portals of the damned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>As the momentous hour approaches, as the mind wells upon the tremendous results which the future may bring forth, what a fathomless abyss of shame and agony if we fail; what a celestial <placeName reg="Canaan, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063278">Canaan</placeName> of joy and deliverance if we triumph &mdash; the suspense might drive the mind to madness if we could permit ourselves to doubt the justice of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the determined hearts and strong arms which He has raised up in our defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> Now that the enemy has fully unveiled his plans and purposes, the armies of the <rs>South</rs> need no incentive from any Confederate voice or pen. There was a time when they might have doubted that such infernal designs could be actually harbored in the hearts of any race of men calling themselves civilized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But those doubts can exist no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It is not the restoration of the defunct Union that they seek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They themselves laugh the idea to scorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It is our subjugation, openly proclaimed by their Congress; it is the confiscation of every foot of land owned by every Southern man. Our extermination is a matter of comparative unimportance so they rob us of all we possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Let the population secede, says <persName n="Beecher,,Henry,Ward,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="default:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Ward</foreName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>; we care not for the population, but the lands cannot secede &mdash; those we must have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>With the exception of some <num value="1000">thousands</num> of official necks, which they threaten to break, they would perhaps desire that the mass of the population should live and suffer, should beg and starve in sight of their old homes; that they should be made hewers of wood and drawers of water for their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> taskmasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Death would be a refuge and repose in comparison with such torments, which they will not vouchsafe to the hated people, base envy of whose superior comfort and elevation of character is the great mainspring of this Satanic war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> Soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, in the hour of battle remember these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Never had a people such wrongs to avenge, such evils to avert, such glorious rewards to gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>You are no longer deciding the question of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery &mdash; that is the fixed decree of Heaven; but the question is whether you and your children shall be slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Answer that question as freemen know how to answer it, and, with the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> will accomplish your deliverance, and secure the independence of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
