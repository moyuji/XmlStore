<head>Mining and the miner.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> In these cold and nipping days, when the good people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> put their toes on the fender and poke their coal fires into blaze, they rarely think where that coal comes from, or of the labor, the courage, the patience and the skill required to bring its cheerfulness and glow to their hearth-stones. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The coal measure of <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName> are worked at <num value="2">two</num> print rest points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><num value="1">One</num> near <placeName reg="Coalfield station">Coalfield station</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName> road, and the other at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Appomattox, Virginia" key="tgn,7013312">Clover Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>At the latter place the works are quite extensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The strata of coal outcrop there and dip to the westward, descending at about the angle of <num value="23">twenty-three</num> degrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>These seams or layers of coal &mdash; alternating with layers of stone like the cake and jelly of jelly-cake &mdash; differ much in thickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The richest is about <measure n="27feet" type="distance">twenty-seven feet</measure> through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some are so thin that the working of them would not be productive.--The mines are of <num value="2">two</num> kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><num value="1">One</num> kind begin at the outcrop, where the coal comes to the surface, and follows down the bed with a long shaft, called an &#x0022;incline, &#x0022; sometimes steep and sometimes nearly horizontal, according to the inclination of the stratum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Thus a shaft <measure n="1500feet" type="distance">fifteen hundred feet</measure> long becomes at the lower end about <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="700feet" type="distance">seven hundred feet</measure> below the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Up this shaft runs a double railroad track, each traversed by a small car, drawn by a rope or chain passing over a drum at the mouth of the shaft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Thus <num value="1">one</num> car depends as the other rises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A steam engine above ground, at the top of the shaft, does this work, as well as the pumping and ventilating of the mine.-- Running at right angles with this shaft are long galleries called levels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>These keep very nearly horizontal by winding and turning as the dip of the seam changes in inclination.--These have also railroads running through them, the cars of which are drawn by mules &mdash; poor animals that never see the blessed sunlight, nor ever munch a mouthful of fresh herbage from <num value="1">one</num> year's end to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>No wonder that they get a little obstinate sometimes, or bray out a note of complaint to a fellow-sufferer in an adjoining drift &mdash; but this is pathetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These levels are nearly parallel, and about a <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> apart, all coming into the main shaft, of course, at lower points as the shaft descends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>These in their turn are intersected by another set of drifts about <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> apart, running at right angles with them, and of course parallel with the main shaft or &#x0022;incline.&#x0022; Thus the whole bed of coal is cut through with passages crossing <num value="1">one</num> another, leaving large masses of coal, called &#x0022;pillars,&#x0022; to support the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>When the whole seam is thus explored, and the drifts have struck rock all around, then commences the work of &#x0022;robbing&#x0022;--cutting away the pillars of coal &mdash; of course beginning at that part of the mine farthest away from the shaft, for the roof tumbles in as they are cut, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Dangerous work this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The other mine sinks a perpendicular shaft <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="900feet" type="distance">nine hundred feet</measure> deep, and of course a long distance off from the out-crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The levels strike off from the foot of this, and the mining is carried on in the same manner, except that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is carried <hi rend="italics">downward</hi> from the surface, and this is carried from the bottom of the shaft <hi rend="italics">upward</hi> toward the out-crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The foot of the shaft is the deepest part of the mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Of course these levels cannot always be parallel, or equidistant, or the intersecting drifts straight and at right angles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The varying dip of the strata, the disappearance of some veins, the discovery of others, and, most of all, the masses of rock, called &#x0022;troubles,&#x0022; all tend to change the regularity of the mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>A high grade of science and experience are called into play to circumvent these troubles, or to tell where and how to cut through them, and to follow the vein of coal through all its faults and turnings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The draining of the mines is frequently a problem of great difficulty, as enormous veins of water often burst out, sometimes flooding a whole mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The ventilation, too, is most important, as the lives of all in the pit depend upon its perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The system of sending fresh pure air through all the labyrinth of passages is too complicated to be explained here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is sufficient to say that a strong current is created by a large fan revolving with great rapidity, which expels the foul gases and brings the wholesome air down from the open world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <num value="1">One</num> can easily see that this is hard work &mdash; and dangerous too. Dangers exist, hard to anticipate, and difficult, if not impossible, to provide against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The ceiling of brittle coal-slate sometimes crushes through all its props, and its black lumps are made red with the blood of the mangled miner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A blast might open communication with some vast reservoir of water, and the narrow drifts and galleries fill so fast that escape would become impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Sometimes the gas &mdash; the same gas that, tamed and civilized, lights our houses &mdash; accumulates here his natural savage strength, and gathering too rapidly for the ventilator to purify, explodes with a force compared with which <hi rend="italics">gun</hi>powder is a trifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Everything is slivered and splintered by its fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Then fellows the &#x0022;black damp&#x0022; --air from which all the life-sustaining principle is burnt out &mdash; and if any escape unhurt from the concussion, they are <hi rend="italics">drowned</hi> in the lifeless air. And this work, with all its severe labor and danger, begets a class of men who take in it a strange delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>When <persName n="Shelley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Shelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Shelley</surname></persName> spoke of men &#x0022;leaner than fleshliness misery, who waste their lives in far down darksome mines,&#x0022; he surely never could have seen the <name>Welsh</name>, <persName n="Cornish,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Cornish,nomatch:0"><surname>Cornish</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="New Castle, Henry, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040481">Newcastle</placeName> miners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName> mines are worked chiefly by these men, and a sturdy set of fellows they are. They prefer the pit to any other work, and have the same kind of scorn of surface men that sailors have of land &#x0022;lubbers,&#x0022; or that trappers have of civilized folks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They feel that high qualities, that energy, courage and patience are called into play here, and that they are spending strength on strength in the stern labor of cutting their way through living rock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They love the solid darkness of the mine, its perilous descents, the intricate mazes of its drifts and galleries, often steep and slippery, and its utter isolation from the rest of the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The sailor and the trapper have been told of often enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><persName n="Cooper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><surname>Cooper</surname></persName> alone has said quite enough of both; but no <num value="1">one</num> has ever taken the pitman, in his grimy dress, hard-handed, swart, and smutted, and made a hero of him. But perhaps his turn may yet come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>An <name>English</name> writer, speaking of the dignity of labor, said that when the epic poem of our day is written, it will not be &#x0022;Arms and the <name>Man</name>.&#x0022; &#x0022;Tools and the <name>Man</name>&#x0022; will be our epic, and then will the <name>Pitman</name> be sung. </p> </div3>

<head>Fashion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> For the benefit of our lady friends, we give a little gossip about the fashions for <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> in New York and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> A favorite dinner dress is of violet <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> poplin, trimmed with blase bands of white poplin, arranged to simulate an overskirt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> The coiffure is of <hi rend="italics">point applique</hi> lace and violet velvet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The hair is rolled from the face and caught up in a waterfall at the back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> This is an admired home dress: <persName n="Ruby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Ruby,nomatch:0"><surname>Ruby</surname></persName> reps, trimmed with velvet buttons and ruby silk cord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The hair is crimped and arranged in a loose coil at the back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The coiffure consists of a band of ruby velvet studded with jet beads, and tied at the back with a ruby chenille cord. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Also an evening dress, rather flashy than elegant, of white <hi rend="italics">crepe</hi> puffed over silk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The cuffs are confined by bands of scarlet velvet edged with black lace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The overskirt of <hi rend="italics">crepe</hi> is bordered by scarlet velvet and black lace, and festooned up very high on the left side by a bunch of white flowers and loops of scarlet velvet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The corsage is of scarlet velvet, trimmed with buttons and black lace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Folds of <hi rend="italics">crepe</hi> are laid above the corsage, and about the <hi rend="italics">crepe</hi> is a fulling tulle drawn closely to the neck, and trimmed with pearl beads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Bunches of flowers and loops of velvet ribbon ornament the sleeves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The hair is rolled from the face, and arranged in a loose waterfall at the back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The coiffure is formed of bandeaux of scarlet velvet, caught at the side by a tuft of flowers and loops of velvet ribbon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The genuine Empire bonnet is so very peculiar in shape that only a tall, stylish-looking person could wear it to advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Imagine a flat, square crown, with small front and long gipsy ears tying behind underneath the water-fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>A band of ribbon fastened on top passes down and ties under the chin, pressing the bonnet so closely to the face that side trimmings are entirely suppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Gilt chains on velvet, a rich ornament, or a few flowers, are placed over the forehead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In the hand these bonnets are decidedly ugly, but when &#x0022;well worn&#x0022; they are quite <hi rend="italics">distingue.</hi> It is not incumbent upon every <num value="1">one</num> to wear these exaggerated styles, as there are several very pretty modifications of the <rs>Empire</rs> bonnet. --All are exceedingly small, with raised, soft crowns, or else a perfectly flat crown, and a small, tightly-covered cape, or band set up rather high on the crown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> The principal feature in the new bonnets is the veil, which has now become the all-important item both for bonnets and hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It is of unhemmed <rs type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">white</rs> illusion, spangled with gold, figured net, <hi rend="italics">crepe lisse,</hi> or else the regular made veil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is either caught on the side of the bonnet by a fancy ornament, or is fastened just over the crown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The length varies from <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a yard to <measure n="1yard" type="distance">one yard</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> It was thought that waterfalls would disappear when the <rs>Empire</rs> bonnet was introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Such, however, is not the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The bonnets are so short in the crown as to positively require a <hi rend="italics">chignon</hi> of some kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Though the waterfall is still popular, the thick coil is fast gaining favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> <sic>It</sic> it is a noticeable feature that metal ornaments are introduced into the <hi rend="italics">toilette</hi> wherever it can possibly be done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Flower <rs n="head dresses" type="product">head-dresses</rs> have, in a great measure, given place to antique-looking bandeaux of gilt, steel or silver, either plain, engraved or filigreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Some are ornamented with a richly-enamelled butterfly, poised on a fine wire, in the centre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> The newest boots for young ladies are of lasting, laced up in front over a tongue of colored silk, which can be changed at pleasure to suit the dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>A small rosette of velvet, matching the tongue in color, is worn on the toe of the boot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This rosette on the toe must be very ugly, utterly destroying the outline of the foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The fashions of New York and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> are not pretty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>There is an air of over-trimming, vulgar glitter, and an all-pervading flavor of shoddy and petroleum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We have given the fashions, but we entreat the ladies of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> not to wear them. </p>

I remembered it well, that snow, though it was <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> since I had last seen its cheerless face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>There it lay, in the same old ruts, and spreading the same old snares on the side-paths.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/> I poked up my fire, and took a long look backward upon my past life, through the embers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>I remembered how my childhood had been embittered by dependence, how my rich and respectable uncle, whose ruling passion was vain-glory had looked on my existence as a nuisance, not so much because he was obliged to open his purse to pay for my clothing and education, as because that, when a man, he thought I could reflect no credit upon his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>I remembered how, in those days, I had a soul for the beautiful, and a certain, almost womanish, tenderness of heart, which, by dint of much sneering, had been successfully extracted from me. I remembered my uncle's unconcealed relief at my determination to go abroad and seek my fortune, the cold good-bye of my only cousin, the lonely, bitter farewell to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, hardly sweetened by the impatient hopes that consumed rather than cheered me &mdash; the hopes of name and gold, won by my own exertions, with which I should yet wring from those who despised me the worthless respect which they denied me now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> Sitting there at the fire, I rang the bell, and the waiter came to me: and old man, whose face I remembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>I asked him some questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>Yes, he knew <persName n="Rutland,Mister,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00358" reg="default:Rutland,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>; recollected that many years ago he used to stay at <persName n="Morley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="mostcommon:Morley,nomatch:0"><surname>Morley</surname></persName>'s when he came to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>The old gentleman had always stayed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/> It was about <num value="7">seven</num> on a frosty evening when I arrived at the imposing entrance of <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>No <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> came rushing out to meet me. &#x0022;Of course not,&#x0022; I thought; &#x0022;I am unused to their formal manners in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>He is lying in wait for me on the mat inside.&#x0022; I was admitted by a solemn person as quietly and mechanically as though my restoration to home and kindred were a thing that had happened regularly in his presence every day since his birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>He ushered me into a grand hall, but no mat supported the impatient feet of the dignified master of the house. &#x0022;Ah !&#x0022; said I, &#x0022;even this, perhaps, were scarcely etiquette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>No doubt he stands chafing on the drawing-room hearth-rug, and I have little enough time to make myself presentable before dinner.&#x0022; So, resigning myself to circumstances, I meekly followed a guide, who volunteered to conduct me to the chamber assigned to my especial use. I had to travel a considerable distance before I reached it. &#x0022;Dear me !&#x0022; I remarked to myself when I did reach it, &#x0022;I had expected to find the rooms in such a house more elegantly appointed than this !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/> I made my toilette, and again submitting myself to my guide, was convoyed to the drawing-room door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>All the way down stairs I had been conning pleasant speeches with which to greet my kinsfolk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>I am not a brilliant person, but I sometimes succeed in pleasing when I try, and on this occasion I had the desire to do my best. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/> The drawing-room door was at the distant end of the hall, and my arrival had been so very quiet that I conceived my expectant entertainers could hardly be aware of my presence in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>I thought I should give them a surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>The door opened and closed upon me, leaving me within the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>I looked around me, and saw &mdash; darkness there, and nothing more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/> Ah, yes, but there was something more ! There was a blazing fire which sent eddying swirls of light through the shadows, and right in the blush of its warmth a little figure was lounging in an easy chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The little figure was a girl of apparently about <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of age, dressed in a short, shabby black frock, who was evidently spoiling her eyes by reading by the fire-light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>She lay with her head thrown back, a mass of fair curly hair being thus tossed over the velvet cushion on which it rested, while she held her book aloft to catch the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>She was luxuriating in her solitude, and little dreaming of interruption. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/> She was so absorbed in her book, the door had opened and closed so noiselessly, and the room was so large that I was obliged to make a sound to engage her attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>She started violently then, and looked up with a nervous fearfulness in her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>She dropped her book, sat upright, and put out her hand, eagerly grasping a thing I had not noticed before, and which leaned against the chair.--a crutch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>She then got up, leaning on it, and stood before me. The poor little thing was lame, and had <num value="2">two</num> crutches by her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/> I introduced myself, and her fear seemed to subside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>She asked me to sit down, with a prim little assumption of at-home-ness, which did not sit upon her with ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>She picked up her book and laid it on her lap; she produced a net from the recesses of her chair, and, with a blush, gathered up the curls and tucked them into its meshes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>Then she sat quiet, but kept her hand upon her crutches, as if she was ready at a moment's notice to limp away across the carpet, and leave me to my own resources. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/> &#x0022;<persName n="Thomson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00366" reg="mostcommon:Thomson,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomson</surname></persName> thought there was nobody in the room,&#x0022; she said, as if anxious to account for her own presence there. &#x0022;I always stay in the nursery, except sometimes when they all go out, and I get this room to myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Then I like to read here.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/> &#x0022;<persName n="Rutland,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="nearbymention:Rutland,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName> is not at home?&#x0022; I said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/> &#x0022;No; they are all out dining.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/> &#x0022;Indeed ! Your papa, perhaps, did not get my letter?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/> She blushed crimson. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/> &#x0022;I am not a <persName n="Rutland,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="nearbymention:Rutland,George,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>,&#x0022; she said. &#x0022;My name is <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>. I am an orphan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>My father was a friend of <persName n="Rutland,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="nearbymention:Rutland,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>, and he takes care of me for charity.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/> The last word was pronounced with a certain controlled quiver of the lip. But she went on. &#x0022;I don't know about the letter, but I heard a gentleman was expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>I did not <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> think it could be to-night, though, as they all went out.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/> &#x0022;A reasonable conclusion to come to,&#x0022; I thought, and thereupon began musing on the eagerness of welcome displayed by my affectionate <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>If I were the gentleman expected, they must have received my letter, and in it were fully set forth the day and hour of my proposed arrival. &#x0022;Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>, my dear fellow,&#x0022; I said, &#x0022;you are not a whit changed!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> Arriving at this conclusion, I raised my glance, and met, full, the observant gaze of a pair of large shrewd grey eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>My little hostess, for the time being, was regarding me with such a curiously legible expression on her face that I could not but read it and be amused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>It said plainly: &#x0022;I know more about you than you think, and I pity you. You come here with expectations which will not be fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>There is much mortification in store for you. I wonder you came here at all. If I were once well outside these gates I should never limp inside them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>If I knew a road out into the world you come from I would set out bravely on my crutches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>No, not even for the sake of a stolen hour like this, in a velvet chair, would I remain here.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/> How any <num value="1">one</num> glance could say all this was a riddle; but it did say all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The language of the face was as simple to me as though every word had been translated into my ear. Perhaps a certain internal light, kindled long ago, before this little orphan was born, or <persName n="Rutland,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00371" reg="default:Rutland,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName> had become owner of <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>, assisted me in deciphering so much information so readily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>However that may be, certain things before surmised became assured facts in my mind, and a quaint bond of sympathy became at once established between me and my companion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/> &#x0022;<persName n="Ray,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00372" reg="nearbymention:Ray,Teecie,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>,&#x0022; I said, &#x0022;what do you think of a man who, having been abroad for <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure>, has the impudence to come home without a shilling in his pocket?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Ought he not to be stoned alive?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> &#x0022;I thought how it was,&#x0022; she said, shaking her head, and looking up with another of her shrewd glances. &#x0022;I knew it, when they put you into such a bad bedroom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>They are keeping all the good rooms for the people who are coming next week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>The house will be full for <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00373" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>It won't do,&#x0027;&#x0022; she added, meditatively. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> &#x0022;What won't do?&#x0022; I said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/> &#x0022;Your not having a shilling in your pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>They'll sneer at you for it, and the servants will find it out. I have a guinea that old <persName n="Thornton,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00374" reg="mostcommon:Thornton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Thornton</surname></persName> gave me on my birthday, and if you would take the loan of it I should be very glad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>I don't want it at all, and you could pay me back when you are better off.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/> She said this with such business-like gravity that I felt obliged to control my inclination to laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>She had evidently taken me under her protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Her keen little wits foresaw snares and difficulties besetting my steps during my stay at <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>, to which my newer eyes, she imagined, must be ignorantly blind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>I looked at her with amusement, as she sat there seriously considering my financial interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>I had a fancy to humor this quaint confidential relation that had sprung up so spontaneously between us. I said gravely: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/> &#x0022;I am very much obliged to you for your offer, and will gladly take advantage of it. Do you happen to have a guinea at hand?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/> She seized her crutches, and limped quickly out of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Presently she returned with a little bon-bon box, which she placed in my hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Opening it, I found <num value="1">one</num> guinea, wrapped up carefully in silver paper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/> &#x0022;I wish it had been more !&#x0022; she said, wist-fully, as I coolly transferred it to my pocket, box and all, &#x0022;But I so seldom get money !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> At this moment the solemn person who had escorted me hither and thither before announced that my dinner was served. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> On my return to the drawing-room I found, to my intense disappointment, that my beneficent bird had flown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/><persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00375" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName> had limped off to the nursery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/> Next morning, at breakfast, I was introduced to the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>I found them, on the whole, pretty much what I had expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>My <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> had developed into a pompous portly paterfamilias; and, in spite of his cool professions of pleasure, was evidently very sorry to see me. The <rs>Mamma Rutland</rs> just countenanced me, in a manner the most frigidly polite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The grown-up young ladies treated me with the most well-bred negligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Unless I had been very obtuse indeed, I could scarcely have failed to perceive the place appointed for me in <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>I was expected to sit below the salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>I was that dreadful thing &mdash; a person of no importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName> amused himself with me for a few days, displaying to me his various fine possessions, and then, on the arrival of grander guests, left me to my own resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>The <rs>Misses Rutland</rs> endured my escort on their riding expeditions only till more eligible cavaliers appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>As for the lady of the house, her annoyance at having me quartered indefinitely on her premises was hardly concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The truth was, they were new people in the circle in which they moved, and it did not suit them to have a poor relation coming suddenly among them, calling them &#x0022;cousin,&#x0022; and making himself at home in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>For me, I was not blind, though none of these things did it suit me to see. I made myself as comfortable as was possible under the circumstances, took every sneer and snub in excellent part, and was as amiable and satisfied on all occasions as though I believed myself to be the most cherished inmate of the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>That this meanness of mine should provoke their contempt, I had hardly a right to complain of. Nor did I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>I accepted this like the rest of their hospitality, and smiled contentedly as the days went on. The gloom which had oppressed me on my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrival in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had all betaken itself away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>How could I feel otherwise than supremely happy at finding myself thus surrounded by my kind relations, thus generously entertained under their hospitable roof? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/> As I found that the guests at <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName> enjoyed a certain freedom in their choice of amusements, and the disposal of their time, I speedily availed myself of this privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>I selected my own associates, and I entertained myself as pleased me best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Not finding myself always welcomed in the drawing-room, I contrived, by a series of the most dexterous artifices, to gain the free entree of the nursery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>In this nursery were growing up some <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> younger branches of the <name>Rutland</name> family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>After a certain hour in the day none of the elders ever thought of invading its remote precincts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/><time value="5oclock">Five o'clock</time> in the evening was the children's tea hour, and the pleasantest, I thought, in the <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Nurse was a staid woman, who knew how to appreciate a little present now and again, and to keep her own counsel on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>The children were not pleasant children; they were unruly, mischievous little wretches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>They conceived a sort of affection for me, because I sometimes brought to the nursery sundry purchases made during solitary rides; picture-books, toys, dolls, or sweetmeats, procured by means of <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>'s guinea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>I suggested as much to Teecie <num value="1">one</num> evening as she sat by, watching the distribution, and she nodded her head in sage satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>She thought that I economised my substance very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>It covered a great many small extravagances, that guinea did. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/> Whatever might be my position at <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>, <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>'s was simply intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>A spirit less brave must have been cowed and broken by it; a nature less delicate must have been blunted and made coarser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>The servants openly neglected her, the children used her as they pleased; wreaked their humors on her, sparing neither blow nor taunt in their passions, and demanding from her at all times whatever service it suited their capricious fancy to need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Nurse, the only <num value="1">one</num> who ever showed a grain of consideration for the orphan, would sometimes shield her from their impish attacks, when she could do so with safety to herself, but she was not permitted to deal with those darlings in the only fashion which would have been at all likely to bring them to reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>As for the elders of the house, <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>'s momentary presence, or the mere mansion of her name, was sufficient to ruffle their peace of mind. &#x0022;What is to be done with that girl?&#x0022; I heard <persName n="Rutland,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00379" reg="nearbymention:Rutland,George,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName> remark to <num value="1">one</num> of her daughters. &#x0022;If she were not lame <num value="1">one</num> might set her to earn her bread in some way; but, as it is-- &#x0022; A shrug of the shoulders, and a certain vinegar-like expression of countenance, which this lady knew how to assume, sufficiently developed the idea thus imperfectly expressed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/> And how did <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName> meet all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>She did not complain nor rebel, she did not sulk or fret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Under that well-worn black frock of hers she carried a little breastplate of sober determined endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>When sorely tried there was never any cowardly submission to be seen in her grave little face, neither was there ever in her manner or words either reproach or remonstrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>She simply endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Her large patient eyes and mute wise mouth seemed to say, &#x0022;Whatever I suffer, whatever I long to dare, gratitude shackles my limbs, and seals my lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>I am saved from many things; therefore I am dumb.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time I met my little benefactress was a day or <num value="2">two</num> after our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> interview in the drawing-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>I came upon her <num value="1">one</num> afternoon by chance, limping down a hedge lane which lay to the back of the house, away beyond the gardens, and the kitchen gardens, and the pleasure-grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>This lane, I found, led to a large meadow, and beyond the meadow there was a wooded hill, and far down at the distant side of the hill there was a river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>This was <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00381" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>'s favorite ramble, and her <num value="1">one</num> avenue of escape from the torments of the nursery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>I immediately began pouring forth a legion of perplexing troubles and difficulties, <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> to all of which she listened with perfect credulity, expressing her sympathy as I went along by an expressive nod of the head or a shrewd swift glance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Then she gave me her wise little counsel when all was told, and went home, I believe, pondering on my case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> As the days passed, and my relations became more and more involved in their winter gaieties, I found myself more and more thrown upon my own resources for amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Occasionally I was included in an invitation, and accepted it; but in general I preferred indulging my fancy for keeping aloof from those who were little charmed with my company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>A system of the most unblushing bribery had won for me a warm welcome from the savage tribes in the nursery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Many and many an evening found me walking down that hedged lane in the frosty dusk, with <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName> limping by my side, and talking her grave simple little talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>I had always some fresh puzzle to propose to her, and she was always ready to knit her smooth brows over its solution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Once she stopped short and struck her little crutches on the snow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/> &#x0022;You ought to go away from here and work,&#x0022; she cried. &#x0022;O, if I could !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/> A certain <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> arrived at <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>; I will not trouble myself to think of his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> name; it is not worth remembering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>He was a wealthy bachelor of high family, and his movements were watched with interest by the lady of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>This <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> had a fancy for smoking his cigar in the hedged lane, and on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion he encountered my little benefactress limping on her solitary way, and stared at the pretty fresh face under her old black hat till it blushed with uncomfortable brilliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Teecie changed her track like a hunted hare, but <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> scented her out, and annoyed her with his fulsome compliments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The matter reached <persName n="Rutland,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="nearbymention:Rutland,George,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>'s ears, and she vented her chagrin on the defenceless little girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>I know not what sorry accusations and reproaches she bestowed upon her during a long private lecture; but that evening when, at the children's tea hour, I entered the nursery door with a new ball in my hand for <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00384" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>, (the youngest and least objectionable of the band,) I saw <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00385" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>'s face grievously clouded for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>It was flushed and swollen with passionate crying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>I do not intend to commit to paper certain remarks which I made <hi rend="italics">sotto voce</hi> on beholding this disfigurement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> &#x0022;Come, come, Teecie, &#x0022; I said, while Nurse was busy quelling a disturbance which had arisen because &#x0022;<persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Guy</foreName></persName>&#x0022; had not brought something to every <num value="1">one</num> else as well as <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00386" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>; &#x0022;where is all your philosophy, little mother?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>You need never preach to me again, if you set me such a bad example.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/> Teecie said never a word, but stared on into the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>This wound had cut deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/><persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Rutland,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00387" reg="nearbymention:Rutland,George,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>, at that moment I should have dearly loved to knock your <num value="2">two</num> good-for-nothing heads together ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/> &#x0022;Teecie,&#x0022; I said, &#x0022;you have <num value="1">one</num> friend, at any rate, even if he be not a very grand <num value="1">one</num>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/> She gave <num value="1">one</num> of her quaint expressive little nods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Translated, it meant: &#x0022;I understand all that, but I cannot talk just now.&#x0022; By-and-by, however, she brightened up, and went to the table to claim her share of tea and thick bread and butter, and I began to mend a bow belonging to <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>. <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the leaders of the unruly tribes, a regular savage chieftain. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> Ere <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> more had passed I felt strongly inclined to exercise the horsewhip on this young gentleman's shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> fine morning, was seized with an impish inspiration to play a trick upon Teecie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Stealing her crutches, he walked about the nursery mimicking her poor little limp, and then marching off with them, heedless of her entreaties to have them restored, carried them in triumph out of doors, and smashed them in pieces with a hatchet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Teecie sat helpless in the din and riot of that ill-conditioned nursery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Bright bracing days came and found her a prisoner, looking with longing eyes through the window-panes out over the beautiful country lanes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> saw her patience with the most audacious indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>But why talk about <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>I could not help believing, nor do I ever intend to help believing, that older heads than <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s plotted the cruel caging of that bonnie bird. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/> The bird drooped on its perch; but who cared?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Nurse vowed it was a shame, and showed more kindness than usual to the prisoner, but I will not venture to decide how much of this tenderness was owing to the odd crown-pieces which found their way from my hand to hers &mdash; all out of the guinea, of course?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>O yes, all out of the guinea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>And there was another friend who sometimes expressed an interest in <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00388" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>'s existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>This was that <persName n="Thornton,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00389" reg="mostcommon:Thornton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Thornton</surname></persName>, whose bounty had indirectly furnished me with pocket-money during my stay at <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>The favor of this old lady I had done my best to win. She was a nice, comfortable old lady, and I liked her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>I chanced to be alone in the drawing-room when she arrived, and I seized the opportunity to tell her the story of Teecie's crutches. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> &#x0022;A bad boy !&#x0022; she said. &#x0022;A bad, malicious boy ! She must get new crutches before my party.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> &#x0022;Of course she must,&#x0022; I said very heartily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/> The old lady threw back her head, raising her fat chin in a peculiar sort of way, and looking at me direct through her spectacles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> &#x0022;Indeed !&#x0022; she said. &#x0022;Pray, young man, what particular interest do you take in <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00391" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/> I smiled. &#x0022;Oh, Teecie and I are excellent friends,&#x0022; I said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/> &#x0022;Teecie and you !&#x0022; she repeated. &#x0022;Pray, are you aware that <persName n="Ray,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="nearbymention:Ray,Teecie,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName> is <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age?&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>But often afterwards during that day I laughed when I thought of <persName n="Thornton,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00397" reg="mostcommon:Thornton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Thornton</surname></persName>'s information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Preposterous ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> <num value="1">One</num> morning, when it wanted but a week of the party, a curious event occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The heads of the house met in consultation on the matter, in the library, before breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>An extraordinary Thing had arrived from <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> at <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The Thing was a large wooden case, directed to <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00399" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>. On being eagerly opened, it was found to contain a pair of crutches. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/> And such a pair of crutches ! Light and symmetrical, and fanciful, works of art in their way. Tortoise-shell stems, with silver mountings of exquisite workmanship, capped with dainty little cushions of embroidered velvet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Thunder-stricken were the elders of the house. &#x0022;Who could have done this thing?&#x0022; was on every lip. Who, indeed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Who outside of <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName> had ever heard of <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00400" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>These crutches were costly affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>I knew the conclusion they came to, <num value="1">one</num> and all. They pitched on <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> as the culprit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>It was a thorn in their side, and I rubbed my hands in glee. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/> Having considered the question in their dismay, they decided that Teecie should be kept in ignorance of her mysterious present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>It was not fit for her to use; it would fill her mind with absurd ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>And so, in spite of the arrival of her beautiful new crutches, poor Teecie still sat helpless in the nursery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>The wooden case and its contents were hidden away, and no word was spoken of their existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> I waited a few days to see if the elders would relent, but to no purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>The bird still pined on its perch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>No kindly hand seemed likely to open the cage door and let it fly. There sat Teecie, day after day, in her nursery chair, hemming aprons for nurse, or darning the children's stockings, looking longingly out of the window, and growing pale for want of fresh air. Still never rebelling, never complaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>Meantime the stir of <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00401" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName> preparation was agitating all the household, and the children were full of rapture at the prospect of <persName n="Thornton,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00402" reg="mostcommon:Thornton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Thornton</surname></persName>'s Christmas party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>There was great excitement in the nursery about pretty new dresses, wonderful fussing about ribbons, and muslins, and fripperies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Teecie alone sat silent in her shabby frock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>By-and-by her hands were full, bowing up sashes, sewing on tuckers, stitching rosettes on shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>She was a nimble little workwoman, and they kept her busy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Seeing how well a lapful of bright ribbons became her, I thought it a pity she should not have a gay dress as well as the rest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> Nobody said, &#x0022;Teecie, what will you wear?&#x0022; nor even, &#x0022;Teecie, are not you invited too?&#x0022; No <num value="1">one</num> seemed to expect for a moment that Teecie could wish to be merry with the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>How could she go, she who was lame and had no crutches? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> It happened that I had an errand to the nearest town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>It was rather late, when, on my return, I called at the best millinery establishment in the place and asked for a parcel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> Yes, the parcel was ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>A large flat box. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> &#x0022;Would the gentleman like to see the lady's pretty dress !&#x0022; The box was opened, and a cloud of some airy fabric shaken out under my eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>I cannot, of course, describe it, but it was something white, very pure and transparent, with something else of pink just blushing through it. It was very tasteful, I pronounced, trying to look wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>There was only <num value="1">one</num> fault: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> &#x0022;Did it not seem rather long for a little girl?&#x0022; I asked, remembering the figure it was to adorn, with its short skirt just coming to the top of the boots, so well worn and mended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> &#x0022;Oh, sir,&#x0022; said the milliner, with dignity, &#x0022;you said the young lady was <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age, and of course we have given her a flowing skirt !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/> It was late in the evening when I reached home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/><num value="2">Two</num> merry carriage-fulls were just departing from the door as I drove up. A few minutes afterwards I was in the nursery with the milliner's parcel in my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>There sat dear little Cinderella, resting <num value="1">one</num> flushed check on her hand, and contemplating the litter of scraps of ribbon, fragments of lace, scissors, flowers, and reels of cotton, which lay scattered around her. She had a toilsome, tiresome day, and now they had got all they wanted of her, and had left her to her solitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/> A flash of pleasure sprang to her face when she saw me. &#x0022;Oh ! I thought you had gone with the rest,&#x0022; she said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> &#x0022;No,&#x0022; said I, &#x0022;I have not gone yet, but I am going presently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>I came for you.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/> &#x0022;For me !&#x0022; she echoed in dismay. &#x0022;You know I could not go. I have no dress, even if I could walk.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/> &#x0022;A friend has sent you a dress,&#x0022; I said, &#x0022;and I will undertake to provide the crutches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Nurse, will you please to take this box, and get <persName n="Teecie,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00403" reg="mostcommon:Teecie,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Teecie</surname></persName> ready as quickly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>The carriage is waiting for us at the door,&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/> &#x0022;Teecie flushed very red at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and I thought she was going to burst out crying, and then she turned pale, and looked frightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Nurse, to whom I had slipped a munificent <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00404" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName> box, immediately fell into raptures over the pretty dress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/> &#x0022;Come, Teecie,&#x0022; I said, &#x0022;make haste !&#x0022; And trembling between dread and delight, Teecie suffered herself to be carried off to her toilette. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/> By the time I returned from an exploring expedition, with the wonderful silver-and-tortoise-shell crutches under my arm, Teecie was ready. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/> Teecie was ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Those <num value="3">three</num> simple little words mean so much that I feel I must stop and try to translate them into all they are bound to convey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>They do not mean that Teecie, the child whom I was wont to call my little benefactress, my little mother, had got on a nice new frock, and was equipped for a juvenile party like other children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>But they mean that there, when I came back, stood a beautiful girl by the nursery fire, in a fair sweeping blush-colored robe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>When she turned her head, I saw that the sweet face, framed in its child-like curls, was the same, but still the old <rs>Teecie Ray</rs> was gone, and here was (<hi rend="italics">peccavi</hi> <persName n="Thornton,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00405" reg="mostcommon:Thornton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Thornton</surname></persName> !) a lovely woman. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> We were all <num value="3">three</num> ludicrously amazed at the sudden metamorphose that had taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Teecie was too simple not to show that she felt the change in herself, felt it keenly, with a strange delight and a strange shyness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Nurse had so long been accustomed to use her as a child that she stood bewildered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>As for me, I was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> frightened at what I had done, then enchanted, then foolishly awkward, and almost as shy as Teecie herself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/> When I presented the crutches, nurse looked at me as though I must be some prince in disguise, out of the <rs n="Arabian" type="ethnic">Arabian</rs> Nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>It was with a curious feeling that I saw Teecie try them, not limping now, rather gliding over the nursery floor, with the little velvet cushions hidden away amidst clouds of lace and muslin under her round white shoulders, and the airy masses of the fresh tinted gown just crushed back a little by the gleaming silver staves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>I don't know why it was that I thought at that moment, with a certain rapture, of a guinea in a little bon-bon box, that lay below in the <num value="1">one</num> shabby portmanteau which I had thought proper to bring with me to <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName> ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/> Our equipage awaited us. It was too late now to withdraw from what I had under-taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Teecie and I were soon dashing over the snowy roads to <persName n="Thornton,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00406" reg="mostcommon:Thornton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Thornton</surname></persName>'s. I will not attempt to describe the remainder of that memorable evening, or the sensation caused by our arrival; the wonder and mortification of my kind relations; or the mingled pleasure and displeasure of the hostess, who, while delighted to see her little favorite, took occasion to whisper angrily in my ear, &#x0022;And pray, sir, how is all this to end?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> The scene was all new and delightful to Teecie, but her dread of <persName n="Rutland,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00407" reg="nearbymention:Rutland,Christina,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>'s portentous frown would not let her enjoy it. We both felt that a storm would burst over our heads that night, and we were not wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>None of the family from <placeName reg="Rutland Hall">Rutland Hall</placeName> took the least notice of us. When the time came for going home, they went off in their <num value="2">two</num> carriages, and Teecie and I drove home as we had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>When we arrived, we found <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> and his wife waiting for us in the library, armed to the teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>I saw it was to be war and no quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>I need not repeat all that passed between us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/> &#x0022;Sir,&#x0022; he said, &#x0022;we have suffered your insolent intrusion long enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>You leave this house to-morrow morning.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/> &#x0022;<persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>,&#x0022; I said, &#x0022;don't put yourself in a passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>I will go to-morrow morning, but upon <num value="1">one</num> condition &mdash; that <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00409" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName> may come with me, if she will.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/> He looked at me perfectly aghast. &#x0022;Do you know,&#x0022; he said, &#x0022;that she is a penniless, friendless orphan, whom I have sheltered through charity?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/> &#x0022;I want to make her my wife,&#x0022; I said, sternly, &#x0022;if, indeed, I be so fortunate as to have won her affections.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/> &#x0022;And after that, &#x0022;he said, with a sneer, &#x0022;how do you propose to live?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>Upon air, or your friends?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/> &#x0022;Not upon you, <persName n="Rutland,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00410" reg="default:Rutland,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>,&#x0022; I said, looking him steadily in the eyes. &#x0022;Mark me, I have tried you out. I have sifted you, all in this house, like a handful of wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>I found you all chaff, but the <num value="1">one</num> golden grain which lies on my palm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>I will keep it and treasure it, if I may. <name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant I may !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> &#x0022;Very fine,&#x0022; said <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>, &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">very</hi> fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Remember, however, that from this moment I wash my hands of you both; you, <persName n="Rutland,,Guy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00411" reg="default:Rutland,Guy,,,"><foreName>Guy</foreName> <surname>Rutland</surname></persName>, and her, <persName n="Ray,,Teecie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00412" reg="default:Ray,Teecie,,,"><foreName>Teecie</foreName> <surname>Ray</surname></persName>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/> &#x0022;Amen !&#x0022; I said, and bade him good night, and turned on my heel and left him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/> Early the next morning I knocked at the nursery door, and begged of Nurse to awake <persName n="Teecie,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00413" reg="mostcommon:Teecie,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Teecie</surname></persName>, and ask her to speak with me in the garden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>I then went out to wait for her. It was <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas morning</occasion></dateStruct>, the day of peace and good will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>What I felt was scarcely peace, as I looked over the calm landscape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>And yet I bore no ill will to any man or woman. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> Teecie came to me by-and-by; just the same old Teecie, limping over the frosty path in her short shabby frock, and looking half ashamed of her grand new crutches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>I felt relieved when I saw her so. I was shy of the dainty lady whom I had called into existence the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>And yet when I looked more closely, I knew that this was not quite the old <rs>Teecie</rs>, and that the very same Teecie of a day ago never, never, could come back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Something was altered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Whether the change was in her or me, or in both of us, I did not inquire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The change was not an unpleasant <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/> We strolled out of the garden, and into the lane, and we talked earnestly all the way. On our way back I said: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/> &#x0022;And you're not afraid of starving with me, Teecie?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>You'll take the risk?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/> <num value="1">One</num> of her old nods was Teecie's answer. </p>
