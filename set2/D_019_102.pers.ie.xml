<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> <hi rend="italics">Gentlemen of the <rs>Congress</rs>:</hi> </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> It is my pleasing duty to announce to you that the <rs>Constitution</rs> framed for the establishment of a permanent government for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has been ratified by Conventions in each of those States to which it was referred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>To inaugurate the <rs>Government</rs> in its full proportions and upon its own substantial basis of the popular will, it only remains that elections should be held for the designation of the officers to administer it. </p> </q><bibl n="Gentlemen of the Congress"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> There is every reason to believe that at no distant day, other States identified in political principles and community of interests with those which you represent will join this Confederacy; giving to its typical constellation increased splendor &mdash; to its government of the equal and sovereign States a wider sphere of usefulness &mdash; and to the friends of constitutional liberty a greater security for its harmonious and perpetual existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> It was not, however, for the purpose of making this announcement that I have deemed it my duty to convoke you at an earlier day <unclear></unclear> that fixed by yourselves for your meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The declaration of war made against this Confederacy by <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in his proclamation issued on the <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> day of the present month; tendered it necessary in my judgment that you should convene at the earliest practicable moment, to devise the measures necessary for the defence of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The occasion is indeed an extraordinary <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It justifies me in a brief review of the relations heretofore existing between us and the <name>States</name> which now unite in warfare against us, and in a succinct statement of the events which have resulted in this warfare; to the end that mankind may pass intelligent and impartial judgment on its motives and objects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> During the war waged against <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> by her colonies on this continent, a common danger impelled them to a close alliance, and to the formation of a Confederation, by the terms of which the colonies, styling themselves States, entered <hi rend="italics">&#x0022;severally&#x0022;</hi> into a firm <orgName n="Friendship League" type="league">league of friendship</orgName> with each other for their common defence, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them, or any other pretence whatever.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> In order to guard against any misconstruction of their compact, the several States made explicit declaration, in a distinct article, that <unclear></unclear> State <unclear></unclear> its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right who has not by this Confederation <hi rend="italics">expressly delegated</hi> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in Congress assembled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Under this contract of alliance, the war of the <name>Revolution</name> was successfully waged, and resulted in the treaty of peace with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></dateStruct>, by the terms of which the several States were, <hi rend="italics">such by name</hi> recognized to be independent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The articles of confederation contained a clause whereby all alterations were prohibited, unless confirmed by the <name>Legislatures</name> of <hi rend="italics">every State,</hi> after being agreed to by the <rs>Congress</rs>; and in obedience to this provision under the resolution of Congress of the <date value="1787-02-21">21st February, 1787,</date> the several States appointed delegates who attended a Convention, <q>&#x0022;for the <hi rend="italics">safe and express purpose</hi> of revising the articles of confederation, and reporting to Congress and the several Legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as shall, when agreed to in Congress, <hi rend="italics">and confirmed by the <name>States</name>,</hi> render the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It was by the delegates chosen, by the <hi rend="italics">several States,</hi> under the resolution just quoted that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was framed in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, and submitted to the <hi rend="italics">several States</hi> for ratification, as shown by the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> articles, which is in these words: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> &#x0022;The ratification of the <hi rend="italics">Conventions of <num value="9">nine</num> States</hi> shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between <hi rend="italics">the <name>States</name></hi> so ratifying the same.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> I have it exercised certain words in the quotation just made, for the purpose of attracting attention to the singular and marked caution with which the <name>States</name> endeavored, in every possible form, to exclude the idea that the separate and independent sovereignty of each State was merged into <num value="1">one</num> common government and nation; and the earnest desire evinced to impress on the <rs>Constitution</rs> its true character &mdash; that of a <hi rend="italics">compact</hi> between independent States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The Constitution of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> having, however, omitted the clause already recited from the articles of confederation, which provided in explicit terms, that each State <hi rend="italics">retained </hi> its sovereignty and independence, some alarm was felt in the <name>States</name> when invited to ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs>, lest this omission should be construed into an abandonment of their cherished principle, and they refused to be satisfied until amendments were added to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, placing beyond any pretence of doubt the reservation by the <name>States</name>, of all their sovereign rights and powers &mdash; not expressly delegated to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Strange indeed must it appear to the impartial observer, but it is none the less true, that all these carefully worded clauses proved unavailing to prevent the rise and growth in the <rs>Northern States</rs> of a political school which has persistently claimed that the government thus formed was not a compact <hi rend="italics">between</hi> States, but was in effect a national government set up <hi rend="italics">above</hi> and <hi rend="italics">over</hi> the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>An organization, created by the <name>States</name> to secure the blessings of liberty and independence against <hi rend="italics">foreign</hi> aggression, has been gradually perverted into a machine for their control in their <hi rend="italics">domestic</hi> affairs, the <hi rend="italics">creature</hi> has been exalted above its <hi rend="italics">creators;</hi> the <hi rend="italics">principles</hi> have been made subordinate to the <hi rend="italics">agent</hi> appointed by themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The people of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, whose almost exclusive occupation was agriculture early perceived a tendency in the <rs>Northern States</rs> to render the common government subservient to their own purposes, by imposing <sic>burthens</sic> on commerce as a protection to their manufacturing and shipping interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Long and angry controversy grew out of these attempts, often successful, to benefit <num value="1">one</num> section of the country at the expense of the other.--And the danger of disruption arising from this cause was enhanced by the fact that the <rs>Northern</rs> population was increasing by immigration and other causes in a greater ratio than the population of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>By degrees as the <rs>Northern States</rs> gained preponderance in the <orgName n="National Congress" type="congress">National Congress</orgName>, self-interest taught their people to yield ready assent to any plausible advocacy of their right as a majority to govern the minority without control; they learned to listen with impatience to the suggestion of any constitutional impediment to the exercise of their will; and so utterly have the principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs> been corrupted in the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, that in the inaugural address delivered by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> last, he asserts as an axiom, which he plainly deems to be undeniable, that the theory of the <rs>Constitution</rs> requires that in all cases the majority shall govern; and in another memorable instance, the same <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> did not hesitate to liken the relations between a State and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to those which exist between a county and the <rs>State</rs> in which it is situated and by which it was created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This is the lamentable and fundamental error on which rests the policy that has culminated in his declaration of war against these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> In addition to the long-continued and deep-seated resentment felt by the <rs>Southern States</rs> at the persistent abuse of the powers they had delegated to the <rs>Congress</rs>, for the purpose of enriching the manufacturing and shipping classes of the <rs>North</rs> at the expense of the <rs>South</rs>, there has existed for nearly half a century another subject of discord, involving interests of such transcendent magnitude, as at all times to create the apprehension in the minds of many devoted lovers of the <rs>Union</rs>, that its permanence was impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> When the several States delegated certain powers to the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName>, a large portion of the laboring population consisted of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slaves, imported into the colonies by the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In <num value="12">twelve</num> out of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> States negro slavery existed, and the right of property in slaves was protected by law. This property was recognized in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and provision was made against its loss by the escape of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The increase in the number of slaves by further importation from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> was also secured by a clause forbidding Congress to prohibit the slave trade anterior to a certain date; and in no clause can there be found any delegation of power to the <rs>Congress</rs> authorizing it in any manner to legislate to the prejudice, detriment, or discouragement of the owners of that species of property, or excluding it from the protection of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The climate and soil of the <rs>Northern Sates</rs> soon proved unpropitious to the continuance of slave labor, whilst the converse was the case at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Under the unrestricted free intercourse between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, the <rs>Northern States</rs> consulted their own interest by selling their slaves to the <rs>South</rs>, and prohibiting slavery within their limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The South were willing purchasers of a property suitable to their wants, and paid the price of the acquisition without harboring a suspicion that their quiet possession was to be disturbed <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> by those who were inhibited, not only by want of constitutional authority, but by good faith as venders, from disquieting a title emanating from themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> As soon, however, as the <rs>Northern States</rs> that prohibited <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery within their limits had reached a number sufficient to give their representation a controlling voice in the <rs>Congress</rs>, a persistent and organized system of hostile measures against the rights of the owners of slaves in the <rs>Southern States</rs> was inaugurated, and gradually extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>A continuous series of measures was devised and prosecuted for the purpose of rendering insecure the tenure of property in slaves: fanatical organizations, supplied with money by voluntary subscriptions, were assiduously engaged in exciting amongst the slaves a spirit of discontent and revolt; means were furnished for their escape from their owners, and agents secretly employed to entice them to abscond; the constitutional provision for their rendition to their owners was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> evaded, then openly denounced as a violation of conscientious obligation and religious duty; men were taught that it was a merit to elude, disobey, and violently oppose the execution of the laws enacted to secure the performance of the promise contained in the constitutional compact; owners of slaves were mobbed and even murdered in open day, solely for applying to a magistrate for the arrest of a fugitive slave; the dogmas of these voluntary organizations soon obtained control of the <name>Legislatures</name> of many of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and laws were passed providing for the punishment by ruinous fines and long-continued imprisonment in jails and penitentiaries, of citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, who should dare to ask aid of the officers of the law for the recovery of their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Emboldened by success, the theatre of agitation and aggression against the clearly expressed constitutional rights of the southern States was transferred to the <rs>Congress</rs>; <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Representatives were sent to the common councils of the nation, whose chief title to this distinction consisted in the display of a spirit of ultra fanaticism, and whose business was, not <q>&#x0022;to promote the general welfare or ensure domestic tranquility,&#x0022;</q> but to awaken the bitterest hatred against the citizens of sister States by violent denunciation of their institutions; the transaction of public affairs was impeded by repeated efforts to usurp powers not delegated by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, for the purpose of impairing the security of property in slaves, and reducing those States which held slaves to a condition of inferiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Finally, a great party was organized for the purpose of obtaining the administration of the <rs>Government</rs>, with the avowed object of using its power for the total exclusion of the slave States from all participation in the benefits of the public domain, acquired by all the <name>States</name> in common, whether by conquest or purchase; of surrounding them entirely by States in which slavery should be prohibited; of thus rendering the property in slaves so insecure as to be comparatively worthless, and thereby annihilating in effect property worth <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This party, thus organized, succeeded, in the month of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, in the election of its candidate for the <name>Presidency</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> In the meantime, under the mild and genial climate of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and the increasing care and attention for the well-being and comfort of the laboring class, dictated alike by interest and humanity, the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slaves had augmented in number from about <num value="600000">600,000</num>, at the date of the adoption of the constitutional compact, to upwards of <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In moral and social condition they had been elevated from brutal savages into docile, intelligent, and civilized agricultural laborers, and supplied not only with bodily comforts, but with careful religious instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Indeed, it is obvious, that under the law of nations, this principle is an axiom, as applied to the relations of independent sovereign States, such as those which had united themselves under the constitutional compact.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> Early in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> the attention of the whole country, as well as that of our Commissioners, was attracted to extraordinary preparations for an extensive military and naval expedition in New York and other Northern ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>These preparations commenced in secrecy, for an expedition whose destination was concealed, only became known when nearly completed, and on the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">5th</day></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="-04-06"><day reg="6">6th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-04-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, transports and vessels of war, with troops, munitions and military supplies, sailed from Northern ports bound Southwards.--Alarmed by so extraordinary a demonstration, the <rs>Commissioners</rs> requested the delivery of an answer to their official communication of the <date value="03-12">12th of March,</date> and thereupon received, on the <date value="04-08">8th April,</date> a reply dated on the <num value="15">15</num> of the previous month, from which it appears that, during the whole interval, whilst the <rs>Commissioners</rs> were receiving assurances calculated to inspire hope of the success of their mission, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> and the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had already determined to hold no intercourse with them whatever; to refuse even to listen to any proposals they had to make, and had profited by the delay created by their own assurances, in order to prepare secretly the means for effective hostile operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> That these assurances were given has been virtually confessed by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by its sending a messenger to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, to give notice of its purpose to use force, if opposed in its intention of supplying <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>No more striking proof of the absence of good faith in the conduct of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> towards this Confederacy can be required, than is contained in the circumstances which accompanied this notice, According to the usual course of navigation, the vessels composing the expedition designed for the relief of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, might be expected to reach <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> on the <date value="04-09">9th April;</date> yet with our Commissioners actually in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, detained under assurances that notice should be given of any military movement, the notice was not addressed to <hi rend="italics">them,</hi> but a messenger was sent to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> to give the notice to the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and the notice was so given at a late hour on the <date value="04-08">8th of April,</date> the eve of the very day on which the fleet might be expected to arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>That this man&#x00E6;uvre failed in its purpose was not the fault of those who contrived it. A heavy tempest delayed the arrival of the expedition, and gave time to the commander of our forces at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> to ask and receive the instructions of this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Even then, under all the provocation incident to the contemptuous refusal to listen to our Commissioners, and the tortuous course of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, I was sincerely anxious to avoid tire effusion of blood, and directed a proposal to be made to the commander of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, who had avowed himself to be nearly out of provisions, that we would abstain from directing our fire on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, if he would promise not to open fire on our forces unless <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at tacked.--This proposal was refused, and the conclusion was reached that the design of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was to place the besieging force at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> between the simultaneous fire of the fleet and the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>There remained, therefore, no alternative but to direct that the fort should at once be reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>This order was executed by <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, with the skill and success which were naturally to be expected from the well known character of that gallant officer; and although the bombardment lasted but <measure n="33hours" type="date">thirty-three hours</measure>, our flag did not wave over its battered walls until after the appearance of the hostile fleet off <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Fortunately not a life was lost on our side, and we were gratified in being spared the necessity of a useless effusion of blood by the prudent caution of the officers who commanded the fleet, in abstaining from the evidently futile effort to enter the harbor for the relief of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I refer to the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> and the papers which accompany it, for further details of this brilliant affair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> In this connection I cannot refrain from a well-deserved tribute to the noble State, the eminent soldierly qualities of whose people were so conspicuously displayed in the port of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>For months they had been irrigated by the spectacle of a fortress held within their principal harbor, as a standing menace against their peace and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Built in part with their own money, its custody confided with their own consent to an agent, who held no power over them other than such as they had themselves delegated for their own benefit, intended to be used by that agent for their own protection against foreign attack, they saw it held with persistent tenacity as a means of offence against them by the very government which they had established for their protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>They had beleaguered it for months &mdash; felt entire confidence in their power to capture it &mdash; yet yielded to the requirements of discipline, curbed their impatience, submitted without complaint to the unaccustomed hardships, labors and privations of a protracted siege; and when at length their patience was rewarded by the signal for attack, and success had crowned their steady and gallant conduct &mdash; even in the very moment of triumph they evinced a chivalrous regard for the feelings of the brave but unfortunate officer who had been compelled to lower his flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>All manifestations of exultation were checked in his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Their <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs>, with their cordial approval and the consent of his government, refrained from imposing any terms that could wound the sensibilities of the commander of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He was permitted to retire with the honors of war &mdash; to salute his flag, to depart freely with all his command, and was escorted to the vessel in which he embarked with the highest marks of respect from those against whom his guns had been so recently directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Not only does every event connected with the siege reflect the highest honor on <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, but the forbearance of her people and of this government from making any harsh use of a victory obtained under circumstances of such peculiar provocation, attest to the fullest extent the absence of any purpose beyond securing their own tranquility, and the sincere desire to avoid the calamities of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Scarcely had the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> received intelligence of the failure of the scheme which he had devised for the reinforcement of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, when he issued the declaration of war against this Confederacy which has prompted me to convoke you. In this extraordinary production, that high functionary affects total ignorance of the existence of an Independent Government, which, possessing the entire and enthusiastic devotion of its people, is exercising its functions without question over <num value="7">seven</num> sovereign States--over more than <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of people &mdash; and over a territory whose area exceeds half a million of square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>He terms sovereign States <q>&#x0022;combinations, too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by law. &#x0022;</q> He calls for an army of <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men to act as a <hi rend="italics">posse comitatus</hi> in aid of the process of the courts of justice in States where no courts exist whose mandates and decrees are not cheerfully obeyed and respected by a willing people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>He avows that <q>&#x0022;the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> service to be assigned to the forces called out, will be, not to execute the process of courts, but to capture forts and strongholds situated within the admitted limits of this Confederacy, and garrisoned by its troops;&#x0022;</q> and declares that &#x0022;this effort&#x0022; is intended <q>&#x0022;to maintain the perpetuity of popular government.&#x0022;</q> He concludes by commanding <q>&#x0022;the persons composing the combinations aforesaid,&#x0022;</q> to wit: the <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of inhabitants of these States, <q>&#x0022;to retire peaceably to their respective abodes within <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> </p> 
<p> Apparently contradictory as are the terms of this singular document, <num value="1">one</num> point was unmistakably evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> called for an army of <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men, whose <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> service was to capture our forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It was a plain declaration of war which I was not at liberty to disregard, because of my knowledge that under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> the <rs>President</rs> was usurping a power granted exclusively to <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> the <rs>Congress</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>He is the sole organ of communication between that country and foreign powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The law of nations did not permit me to question the authority of the <rs>Executive</rs> of a foreign nation to declare war against this Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Although I might have refrained from taking active measures for our defence, if the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs> had all imitated the action of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, by denouncing the call for troops as an unconstitutional usurpation of power to which they refused to respond, I was not at liberty to disregard the fact that many of the <name>States</name> seemed quite content to submit to the exercise of the power assumed by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and were actively engaged in levying troops to be used for the purpose indicated in the proclamation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> Deprived of the aid of Congress at the moment, I was under the necessity of confining my action to a call on the <name>States</name> for volunteers for the common defence, in accordance with the authority you had confided to me before your adjournment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>I deemed it proper further to issue proclamation inviting application from persons disposed to aid our defence in private armed vessels on the high seas, to the end that preparations might be made for the immediate issue of letters of marque and reprisal, which you alone, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, have power to grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I entertain no doubt you will concur with me in the opinion that in the absence of a fleet of public vessels, it will be eminently expedient to supply their place by private armed vessels, so happily styled by the publicists of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, &#x0022;the militia of the sea, &#x0022; and so often and justly relied on by them as an efficient and admirable instrument of defensive warfare.--I earnestly recommend the immediate passage of a law authorizing me to accept the numerous proposals already received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> I cannot close this review of the acts of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> without referring to a proclamation issued by their <rs type="role2">President</rs> under date of the <date value="04-19">19th April, </date> in which, after declaring that an insurrection has broken out in this Confederacy against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, he announces a blockade of all the ports of these States, and threatens to punish as pirates all persons who shall molest any vessel of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> under letters of marque issued by this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Not withstanding the authenticity of this proclamation you will concur with me that it is hard to believe it could have emanated from a President of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Its announcement of a mere paper blockade is so manifestly a violation of the law of nations that it would seem incredible that it could have been issued by authority; but conceding this to be the case so far as the <rs>Executive</rs> is concerned, it will be difficult to satisfy the people of these States that their late confederates will sanction its declarations, will determine to ignore the extermination on both sides, by treating as pirates open enemies acting under the authority of commissions issued by an organized Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>If such proclamation was issued; it could only have been published under the sudden influence of passion, and we may rest assured mankind will be spared the horrors of the conflict it seems to invite. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> For the details of the administration of the different departments, I refer to the reports of the <rs>Secretaries</rs> which accompany this message. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Free transit has been secured for vessels and merchandize passing through the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; and delay and inconvenience have been avoided as far as possible in organizing the revenue service for the various railways entering our territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> In the <num value="2">two</num> States just named, the gentlemen confirmed as Judges declined to accept the appointment, and no nominations have yet been made to fill the vacancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>I refer you to the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs>, and concur in his recommendation for immediate legislation, especially on the subject of patent rights.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> The operations of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> have been necessarily restricted by the fact that sufficient time has not yet elapsed for the purchase or construction of more than a limited number of vessels adapted to the public service.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> I call your attention to the recommendation of the <rs>Secretary</rs> for the establishment of a magazine and laboratory for preparation of ordnance stores, and the necessary appropriation for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Hitherto such stores have usually been prepared at the navy-yards, and no appropriation was made at your last session for this object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> The <rs>Secretary</rs> also calls attention to the fact that no provision has been made for the payment of invalid pensions to our own citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Many of these persons are advanced in life, they have no means of support, and by the secession of these States have been deprived of their claims against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>I recommend the appropriation of the sum necessary to pay these pensioners, as well as those of the army, whose claims can scarcely exceed <measure n="70000dollars" type="currency">seventy thousand dollars</measure> per annum. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster General</rs> has already succeeded in organizing his department to such an extent as to be in readiness to assume the direction of our postal affairs, on the occurrence of the contingency contemplated by the <name>Act</name> of <date value="1861-03-15">15th March, 1861,</date> or even sooner, if desired by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The various books and circulars have been prepared, and measures taken to secure supplies of blanks, postage stamps, stamped envelopes, mail bags, locks, keys, etc. He presents a detailed classification and arrangement of his clerical force, and asks for its increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>An auditor of the treasury for this department is necessary, and a plan is submitted for the organization of his bureau &mdash; The great number and magnitude of the accounts of this department, require an increase of the clerical force in the accounting branch in the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The revenues of this department are collected and disbursed in modes peculiar to itself, and require a special bureau to secure a proper accountability in the administration of its finances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> I call your attention to the additional legislation required for this department to the recommendation for changes in the law fixing the rates of postage on newspapers, periodicals, and sealed packages of certain kinds, and specially to the recommendation of the <rs>Secretary</rs>, in which I concur, that you provide at once for the assumption by him of the control of our entire postal service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> In the military organization of the <name>States</name>, provision is made for Brigadier and <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs>, but in the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName> the highest grade is that of <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Hence it will no doubt sometimes occur that where troops of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> do duty with the militia, the <rs>General</rs> selected for the command, and possessed of the views and purposes of this government, will be superseded by an officer of the militia not having the same advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>To avoid this contingency in the least objectionable manner, I recommend that additional rank be given to the <rs>General</rs> of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate Army</orgName>, and concurring in the policy of having but <num value="1">one</num> grade of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, I recommend that the law of its organization be amended, so that the grade be that of General. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> To secure a thorough military education, it is deemed essential that officers should enter upon the study of their profession at an early period of life, and have elementary instruction in a military school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Until such school shall be established, it is recommended that cadets be appointed and attached to companies until they shall have attained the age and acquired the knowledge to fit them for the duties of <rs type="role2">Lieutenants</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> I shall call your attention to an omission in the law organizing the army, in relation to military chaplains, and recommend that provision be made for their appointment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> In conclusion, I congratulate you on the fact that in every portion of our country there has been exhibited the most patriotic devotion to our common cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Transportation companies have freely tendered the use of their lines for troops and supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The <rs>Presidents</rs> of the railroads of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, in company with others who control lines of communication with States that we hope soon to greet as sisters, assembled in Convention in this city, and not only reduced largely the rate heretofore demanded for mail service and conveyance of troops and munitions, but voluntarily proffered to receive their compensation at these reduced rates in the bonds of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, for the purpose of leaving all the resources of the <rs>Government</rs> at its disposal for the common defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Requisitions for troops have been met with such alacrity that the numbers tendering their services have, in every instance, greatly exceeded the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Men of the highest official and social position are serving as volunteers in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The gravity of age and the zeal of youth rival each other in the desire to be foremost for the public defence; and though at no other point than the <num value="1">one</num> heretofore noticed have they been stimulated by the excitement incident to actual engagement, and the hope of distinction for individual achievement, they have borne what for new troops is the most severe ordeal, patient toil and constant vigil, and all the exposure and discomfort of active service, with a resolution and fortitude such as to command approbation and justify the highest expectation of their conduct when active valor shall be required in place of steady endurance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> A people thus united and resolved cannot shrink from any sacrifice which they may be called on to make, nor can there be a reasonable doubt of their final success, however long and severe may be the test of their determination to maintain their birth-right of freedom and equality, as a trust which it is their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty to transmit undiminished to their posterity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> A bounteous <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> cheers us with the promise of abundant crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The fields of grain which will within a few weeks be ready for the sickle, give assurance of the amplest supply of food for man; whilst the corp, cotton, and other staple productions of our soil, afford abundant proof that up to this period the season has been propitious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> We feel that our cause is just and holy; we protest solemnly in the face of mankind that we desire peace at any sacrifice, save that of honor and independence; we seek no conquest, no aggrandizement, no concessions of any kind from the <name>States</name> with which we were lately confederated; all we ask is to be let alone; that those who never hold power over us shall not now attempt our subjugation by arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>This we will, this we must resist to the direst extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The moment that this pretension is abandoned, the sword will drop from our grasp, and we shall be ready to enter into treaties of amity and commerce that cannot but be mutually beneficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>So long as this pretentious is maintained, with a firm reliance on the <rs>Divine Power</rs> which covers with its protection the just cause, we will continue to struggle for our inherent right to freedom, independence and self-government. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName>  <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <dateline> <name type="place">Montgomery,</name> <date value="1861-04-29">April 29, 1861.</date> </dateline> </closer> </div3>
