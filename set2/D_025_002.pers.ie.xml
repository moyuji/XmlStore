<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is not so, however, as will be seen by the editorial which we republish this morning from the <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">World</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>These news paper <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> certainly know a great deal more than the <rs>Generals</rs> in the field, and we cannot imagine why <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> does not dismiss <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> and put <num value="1">one</num> of them at the head of his army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <num value="1">One</num> thing, however, the <hi rend="italics">World</hi> has guessed as we suspect, rightly in the present instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is, that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> intends something much more serious than a mere incursion into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The powerful force he has with him; the skill with which be mar&#x0153;uvred to deceive <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> and cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> without molestation; the immense stores which he has already collected; or is still collecting, all indicate an enterprise of a serious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>What it may be we have no more means of ascertaining than the <hi rend="italics">World</hi> itself, and should we set into guessing like that paper perhaps we should miss the mark as far as it has probably done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We cannot, in the meantime, avoid smiling when we read the imagined contingencies, in which <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> may get the better of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and, perhaps, &#x0022;bag his army.&#x0022; We can only say, if <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> <hi rend="italics">can</hi> bag <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> he is welcome to him; but we should not be surprised to hear that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had bagged <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They, therefore, await the issue of this expedition in a calm and hopeful spirit confident that if no great result be accomplished, at least no great harm will be done. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The whole population is in an agony of terror, flying before our legions, or submitting, as they advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Already they begin to reckon up their sins &mdash; to remember the smoking ruins of the towns their soldiers have burnt in the <rs>South</rs>--to call to mind the numberless families reduced to beggary by the inhuman barbarities of their merciless Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They be <unclear></unclear> to think on these things and the thought drives them to <unclear></unclear>. &#x0022;Is there to be retaliation,&#x0022; they ask, <unclear></unclear> these enormities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If there is, then <unclear></unclear> lost forever.&#x0022; How different was it <unclear></unclear> years ago, when the whole <rs>North</rs> was pouring forth its legions for the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, when all the cities of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> were filled with troops raging for the spoils of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, when to doubt that success was certain was to incur the penalty of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Now, these very rebels whom they were sent to exterminate, after having beaten them in innumerable battles upon the <rs>Southern</rs> soil, have turned the tables upon them, and are <unclear></unclear> in the unbounded abundance of the <rs type="place">Pennsylvania Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The South is, for a time at least, relieved, and the <rs>North</rs> is bearing the whole burden of the war. Who would have dreamed of such a change <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The great importance of this is fully appreciated by the <rs>French</rs>, and no nation known so well now it is to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The name militia is but a synonym for an undisciplined, raw, <unclear></unclear>, and disorderly mob. It is true we have had instances in this war of determined bravery and hard fighting by militia, that excited general admiration; but it is also true that the sentiment was not disconnected from some degree of astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Now, if the men enrolled, and about to be enrolled, are regularly drilled and properly taught for a short time, they will be something very different from militia, and will deserve a name more creditable to them. &#x0022;National Guard&#x0022; will be very appropriate but there are others that might be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The name will do much towards the formation of the spirit of the organization, and a proper <num value="1">one</num> should be devised and used for it. We repeat, that if there be a proper discipline and steady drilling maintained, and there be such devices employed as will excite a pride in the organization, it will become a most important branch of the service, and perform a part in the history of the day which will give it a prominent place in history.
