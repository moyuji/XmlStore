<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Was this secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Let the facts stated give the reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Was it right for a portion of the <name>States</name> to disregard or destroy a compact with those of their associates who withheld or refused their consent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Allow me to give a short time to the consideration of this inquiry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> It may be concededly that the <rs>Government</rs> formed by the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation was wholly inadequate for its essential purposes &mdash; that it could neither secure us the respect of foreign powers nor promote our prosperity at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>True, it had taken us through the <name>Revolution</name>, but the stern necessities of our condition fired the hearts of the people, and they forbore to question power when it was exercised for the purpose of filling our ranks and feeding and clothing our gallant soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> had enunciated to the world the right of a &#x0022;people to dissolve the political bands which connected them with another,&#x0022; and &#x0022;to alter or to abolish&#x0022; the existing form of Government, &#x0022;and to institute a new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.&#x0022; And in that day no <num value="1">one</num> doubted the right to reform the existing Government and replace it with another whenever any of the parties to it should see fit to do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> It was confidently concluded, by those who believe in the progressive civilization of our race, that our revolution had firmly established <hi rend="italics">this great right.</hi> It had been distinctly proclaimed to the world, as the ground upon which the <num value="13">thirteen</num> dependent colonies of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> justified their separation from the mother country, and the assumption of the rights, powers and duties of independent States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The great struggle had been successfully fought upon it. The declaration containing it had passed into every civilized language &mdash; Our ancestors had acted upon it after their independence had been recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Nor was this all. The celebrated paper, to which I have so often referred, not only distinctly asserted the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> of separation, but boldly proclaimed it to be the <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> of the <name>States</name>, whom it might concern, to exercise it whenever, in their judgment, it was necessary.--It was confidently believed that this great philosophical right, which may, very properly, be called the <hi rend="italics">right of secession,</hi> would preserve the peace be tween the parties to the compact, under all circumstances, and throughout all time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>I know there are many persons who deny this right, and yet admit that of revolution, Now, I cannot too earnestly insist that the right of secession, practically recognized and admitted, is the guaranty of peace; white the right of revolution necessarily leads to civil war. <num value="1">One</num> applies to a confederation of States, and cannot be politically wrong; the other acts within a nation, and is rarely right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It is true the power of the parts is not equal to the power of the whole; but what of that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Governments are not instituted for aggression, but for the security of the rights of &#x0022;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> I have heretofore remarked upon the peculiar language of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, in his letter communicating the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as agreed upon in Convention, to the old Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It was, he says, &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable. --&#x0022;</hi> Without the influence of such considerations it would not have been adopted by the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Wide and deep rooted opposition to it was found to pervade the public mind throughout the <name>Confed</name> racy.--<num value="3">Three</num> of the most powerful minds of the day, in a series of numbers, now known as the <name>Federalist</name>, undertook the task of reconciling the people to its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Many of the <name>States</name> yielded their assent to it with extreme reluctance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, after formidable opposition, headed by <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, sent her ratification of it, with a number of amendments, designed to guard against certain constructions of which it was susceptible, and which, with others, were subsequently adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>And it is certain that the <name>States</name> never would have adopted this untried and much-doubted experiment had there been any question of their right to withdraw at pleasure from the union it was designed to form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> When the <rs>Constitution</rs> was, however, adopted, it was obvious to the most ordinary sagacity, that, unless it was constructed, and its admitted powers were exercised, in the spirit to which the <rs>Constitution</rs> was indebted for its existence, the <rs>Government</rs> authorized thereby could not last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Yet it is a well-known historical fact that a great party was speedily formed to change the whole character of the <rs>Government</rs>, and, through the agency of the implied powers thereof, utterly subvert the reserved powers of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>This was the more remarkable, as the powers of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> were exclusively of a delegated character, and that powers not granted were denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The evidences on this subject might be multiplied as the leaves of autumn, were it necessary; but as I refer to it only for the purpose of pointing out the fountain of bitter waters, I may be spared further specification and be allowed to follow its flow to that great ocean, the storms of which have carried sorrow and death into the bosom of almost every family in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I shall confine myself to <num value="1">one</num> subject only as illustrative of that want &#x0022;of amity, and that of mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the great interests to be protected in the new Constitution was the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.--That interest well know that great efforts would be made for its overthrow, and although at the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> slavery existed in all the <name>States</name> but <num value="1">one</num>, yet the unerring law of race allowed no doubt that its final resting place would be in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>To provide for its safety and protection was a plain and obvious duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Provisions were accordingly inserted in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which were deemed ample and sufficient, and the pride for them cheerfully paid, in power over commerce and navigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Notwithstanding all which, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Congress agitation began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The act of <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, known as the fugitive slave act, was passed to vitalize the clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> authorizing the return of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> And he, the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country and the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, was denied the benefit of a clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and of an act of Congress intended to give it effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>As time swept on agitation continued increasing in strength and volume until, in the great struggle of <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>-'<num value="29">29</num>, it </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> was openly proclaimed by the <rs>North</rs>, in debate, that the admission of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was a question of power, and as such overrode all other considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>It is well known that this question at that time seriously endangered the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Upon its unfortunate adjustment did agitation cease its efforts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>No; its work was only partially accomplished, and agitation was resumed with increased activity, in utter disregard of that fraternal spirit without which the cry of Union was nothing more than an empty sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It again culminate in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> upon the territorial question, and the <rs>Union</rs> once more trembled to its base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>But the wisdom of Congress effected a truce, and by a series of measures postponed the impending blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>This adjustment, however, gave no peace, no repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Fanaticism, balked of its entire purpose, redoubled its efforts &mdash; it gave warning on the floor of the <name>Senate</name> that agitation should never cease until its designs should be fully accomplished; it entered the halls of State legislation and obtained the passage of <hi rend="italics">personal liberty laws</hi>--laws denouncing citizens, in pursuit of their property, as guilty of a crime punishable by confinement in the penitentiary &mdash; laws for removing judges who proved too honest and independent to become the tool of its will --and all intended to nullify a clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and acts passed in pursuance thereof; it incited mobs to do the work of death upon respectable citizens in pursuit of their lawful and constitutional rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>And finally, in disregard to all precedent &mdash; to that &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">spirit of amity</hi>&#x0022; and of &#x0022;that <hi rend="italics">mutual deference and concession</hi>&#x0022; to which I have so frequently referred &mdash; dared to run an entirely sectional ticket, for the highest offices of the country, declaring that it would no longer be dependent upon the slaveholding States to any extent whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The position thus taken and successfully maintained by Northern fanaticism in the election of its candidates filled the hearts of the <rs>Southern States</rs> with despondency and gloom, and impressed them with the melancholy conviction that there was no longer a hope of living in the <rs>Union</rs> in the enjoyment of the rights it was designed to secure, and that the time had come when the existing form of Government having become destructive of those ends for which it was instituted it was their right, as it was their duty, in the language of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, &#x0022;to alter or to abolish it, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> But, notwithstanding the long-continued wrongs and injuries which the <rs>South</rs> had sustained at the hands of the non slaveholding North, most of the <rs>Southern States</rs> still clung with fond tenacity to the work of our father's and essayed in various ways to readjust the disturbed relations of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Our dear old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> made extraordinary efforts, as well befitted her, for readjustment and for peace; but all in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The <rs>North</rs>, stimulated by her hatred of the <rs>South</rs>, and the consciousness of her strength, and believing, unhappily, that we would not dare the last extremity, turned a deaf ear to every overture and resolved on force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>On the <date value="1861-04-15">15th day of April, 1861,</date> <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> issued his proclamation for <num value="75000">75,000</num> men to put down the insurrection, as he was pleased to term it. <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was called upon for her quota, to dragoon her Southern sisters into submission, and she responded by passing, on the <date value="1861-04-17">17th of April, 1861,</date> her ordinance of secession, uniting her fate to theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It was under this conduct on the part of the nonslaveholding States, and after every effort to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> which our ancestors had formed had failed, that our Convention felt itself constrained to take this organic and final step &#x0022;which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.&#x0022; This ordinance was also submitted to a vote of the people, who, with a rare and noble unanimity, approved it, and in support of it pledged to each other &#x0022;our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> I have thus referred to <num value="1">one</num> of the great causes of our unhappy difficulties &mdash; too briefly, perhaps, for perspicuity; perhaps too much at length for such an occasion as the present; and yet I trust of sufficient fulness to clearly show that the sentiment of the <rs>Northern</rs> mind has waged incessant war upon <num value="1">one</num> of the great compromises of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, producing thereby the irritation and injustice which have destroyed those pleasant and happy relations which it was expected the <rs>Union</rs> would establish and assure, and which has culminated in this frightful and bloody war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>While the <rs>South</rs> evinced her love of Union, and her anxiety to preserve the works of our fathers, in the compromises she had made, and in the wrongs and in juries to which she had submitted &mdash; in the great forbearance she had practiced &mdash; and, finally, in her numerous efforts to avoid the dread alternative which was presented to her of unconditional submission or manly resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The war, then, which is now raging was not sought by us; it was forced upon us, and is the last and most flagrant of that series of wrongs which, commencing with the <rs>Government</rs>, is to be resisted to the last extremity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> Invoking the <rs>Divine Will</rs> to enlighten my understanding, and to guide me to that system of measures best calculated to provide for the exigency which is upon us, and to promote the true interests of our country, I proceed to suggest what duty, in my judgment, requires of us, and what a generous patriotism will cheerfully accord. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, then, it is of the greatest moment that our minds should be trained to allow that the entire manhood and property of the country, for the purpose of this war belongs to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The men who are called into the field to join in battle with our enemies, the taxes which are levied and the assessments which are made for their support, are but modes of appropriating the resources of the country, and should neither excite murmurs nor discontent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The man who by tricks, evasions or subterfuges, seeks to avoid the taxes intended to be collected from him, is in heart both knave and traitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It is the duty of the law-maker to provide the amplest punishment for such malefactions, and of every good citizen to bring them to justice, and to hold them up to public scorn and contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>And what should be thought of those who grumble about the prices paid for articles impressed, to feed and clothe the army &mdash; that army which stands between them and ruin &mdash; that army, composed as it is of their own sons, and of their own kith and kin, and which may be disbanded for want of the necessary supplies, while they are higgling with the <rs>Government</rs> agents for higher prices than those established by the <rs>Commissioners</rs>, chosen equally by the <rs>State</rs> and Confederate authorities, and actually appealing to the <rs>Courts</rs> of Justice for protection against the alleged wrong and injury of which they complain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>They are not content with prices fixed by citizen-farmers, chosen for each State, of sound judgment and lofty patriotism; they must have a jury of the vicinage, composed of men like themselves, all anxious &mdash; I will not say willing, but anxious &mdash; to wring from their bleeding and suffering country the last dollar which can be obtained I do not hesitate to say that such a mode of assessment would within <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> drive our armies from the field and utterly annihilate the public credit, unless we established a most enormous system of taxation or the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> should proclaim martial law. The country must not be ruined by the rapacity of the people, and the <rs>Government</rs> will not hesitate, I am sure, to exercise all their constitutional powers when necessary for our safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>I am pleased to say that the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have, with some exceptions, cheerfully accepted the maximum, while not <num value="1">one</num> has been hardy enough to brave public opinion by demanding any other rule of assessment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> While, however, the people of the <rs>State</rs> have acquiesced in the prices fixed by the public commissioners, other have been unwilling to accept them, in consequence of higher prices being offered by speculators and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>This very naturally produces discontent on the part of the more liberal and patriotic portion of the people, while others resort to hoarding, hiding, and other disreputable shifts and evasions, to avoid their contribution to the support of our gallant army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>This state of things is very demoralizing, and may, I think, be easily corrected by the establishment of a State maximum, which, taking the <rs>Confederate</rs> maximum as a basis, shall be extended to all the productions of human industry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> I know that this proposition has always met with the most determined opposition, and yet it has always prevailed in times of public trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I know it is said <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> tried and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> gave up this policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>And yet she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tried it upon corn, then enlarged it, but never made it general, and adhered to it through all the dark hours of her revolution, when she was rent by intestine dissensions and engaged in war with the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and never abandoned it until she had resumed a specie currency, composed her intestine fends, and brought continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to her feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>What occasion had <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to adhere to this policy when she led her armies from the stores of other nations, and replenished her treasury by contributions upon them? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> But it is the duty of wisdom to comprehend the force of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>What is our situation? --We are cut off from the world by our enemies, insulated as completely as if we were on an Island in mid occur, and no productions from abroad, like those raised by us, are allowed to come in competition with our own. Can it be contended, with any propriety, that there can be in such a state of things a market price for commodities in the sense of the economists?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Again, the supply of our own productions is inadequate for a liberal consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Bread, meat, shoes, cotton and woolen cloths, are painful illustrations of this stern fact; and I ask, where is the competition to be found which is to put these articles within easy reach of the naked and the hungry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It is sometimes said that it is the currency which causes this great exaggeration of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>To some extent this may be so. But where the supply of actual necessaries is deficient, and the price of them is fixed by the conscience of the seller alone, the currency is of but little significance, the hungry must be fed, and the seller knows it, and the price must be paid in whatever currency required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> Nor is the maximum unknown in daily life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It was the law that the person who took out a license as a tavern-keeper should keep proper accommodations for the traveller, and then should not charge him for meals at pleasure, but only the rates fixed by the county courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>So in the cases of bridges and ferries, where the prices are fixed by law. But there is a very remarkable case of maximum which seems to have escaped general observation &mdash; I mean interest upon money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>No lender shall take more than <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">six dollars</measure> for the loan of <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure> for <num value="1">one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Should the lender bargain for more, the contract is void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>If he takes more, he forfeits double the sum loaned, Here is a maximum of great antiquity on money, the token or representative of all property; and </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> yet it is not proper to set a maximum on the property so represented! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> That the law of maximum will be difficult to enforce I ready admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>So is the whole criminal code.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>So is the law which forbids the loan of money at more than legal interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>So is that bright, hopeful, and glorious plan of salvation for which a Saviour died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>But shall we, for such reasons, abandon our efforts to reform, benefit, and save mankind? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> But the maximum would have other important advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It would put an end to discontent among the people; it would, extinguish the practice of hoarding and hiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Without any hope of increasing prices, producers would cheerfully furnish to consumers their smooths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Uniformity of price and the application of the maximum to all things would, I am persuaded, inspire general satisfaction, and relieve the necessary duty of collecting supplies for the army of that irritation which has heretofore, in many cases, made the duty most unpleasant, and restore those kind and agreeable relations, which should always exist between the people and their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Surely, when such must be the happy consequence of this measure the <name>States</name> will speedily adopt it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> As an auxiliary to the maximum it is of great importance that the common law offence of forestalling, regrafting, and engrossing, should be made effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Forestalling is defined to be &#x0022;the act of buying provisions before they are offered in market, with intent to sell them at higher prices.&#x0022;--Regrafting is &#x0022;the purchasing of provisions and selling them in the same market&#x0022; Engrossing is &#x0022;the buying up of large quantities of a commodity in order to raise the price.&#x0022; These acts are all offences at the common law, because enhancing the necessaries of life, and thus committing a public wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>These practices are common, and ought to be suppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>If the <name>Legislature</name> would denounce such acts as secretary in public policy, and by a summary remedy punish all persons guilty of them, it would relieve the people from the cruel extortion to which they are now compelled to submit and many a poor family from suffering and want. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> Of a kindred character is the practice of with holding from sale other articles than provisions, with a view of obtaining higher prices at a future day. The law should compel all persons in possession of articles of whatever description not needed for their use to offer them for sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>And to prevent frauds and evasions, such persons should be required to make out inventories of all such articles, whether they are their own property or the property of others, with the cost price thereof, and to deliver the same to a <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName>, to be provided by law, who should put their stamp upon each article, and restrict the owners to a profit not exceeding <num value="0.25">25 per cent.</num> thereon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The auction system, as now conducted, is prejudicial to the good morals and to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>I regard it as having done more to the prejudice of our currency than any other known agency, and, under our present circumstances, as an unmitigated evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Indeed, I regard it as a gigantic system of gambling, under authority of law. I hope it will be speedily suppressed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> At the special session of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> a law was passed to suppress distillation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It was eminently a wise and proper measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>To effect the objects contemplated by the act, however, breweries should be suppressed, and no sale of malt or alcoholic liquors should be permitted, except, perhaps, by apothecaries, who, under proper regulations, might be allowed to do so for strictly medicinal purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>There are many persons among us, foreigners by birth, consuming our food, growing rich by speculation and extortion upon us, and yet denying their obligation to unite in the defence of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Although I cannot see how such pretensions can be maintained, yet, if valid under the law now existing, the law should be changed, and such persons should be compelled to perform military duty, or, at any rate, to leave the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> It is a matter of concern to every patriot to see so many able-bodied men anxious to escape military service, and, to do so, seeking employments of the <rs>Government</rs>, or leaving the country for foreign parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>This evil might be, to a considerable extent, connected by a rigid enforcement of existing law, the refusal of all passports to leave the country, and the enactment of such laws by the <rs>State</rs> and Confederate Governments as might be necessary to correct it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> I cannot too earnestly press upon the public consideration the great importance of organizing the reserved force of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Every element of strength, whether of means or men, which is now left to us, must be combined as an axillary to the armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has our entire body of militia under its command, consisting of the able-bodied men of the <rs>State</rs>, and now proposes to organize our reserved force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>I do not intend, certainly at present, to raise any question about the right to do so, but I confess I should be much concerned to see it exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>A sovereign State without a soldier &mdash; and without the dignity of strength &mdash; stripped of all her men, and without only the form of pageantry of power &mdash; would, indeed, be nothing more than a wretched dependency; to which I should grieve to see our proud old Commonwealth reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Recent events painfully admonish us, also, of the necessity of thorough and complete organization, and I doubt not the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> will, on re-assembling on the <dateStruct value="--6"><day reg="6">6th instant</day></dateStruct>, promptly relieve us of all uneasiness about the legislation of Congress, by the passage of a short yet comprehensive act, clothing the <rs>Governor</rs> with full power to organize the reserved force of the <rs>State</rs> in such manner as may best promote the public interests, having due regard, of course, to the character and to the limited objects to which it is to be applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>A generous confidence on the part of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> in the <rs>Governor</rs>, to whom the executive power of the <rs>State</rs> has been entrusted by the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the people, is, it seems to me, a constitutional duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But, apart from that view of the subject, I respectfully ask it, because it is impossible for any human forethought to provide by legislation for the varying circumstances which may occur during the gigantic war in which we are engaged, and because I cannot believe that I can abuse any trust confided to me, or fail tenderly to consider the feelings and interest of my fellow-citizens in regard to the military duties which they may be called to perform. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The currency of the country, consisting, as it does, almost exclusively of Confederate notes, with which the <name>States</name> and all the people thereof are identified, calls for the most careful consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>It must be thoroughly reformed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The facility with which it is created, and the enormous amounts which are daily issued, naturally lead to waste and extravagance, and inevitably to vice and depravity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Far better would it have been we adopted, at the beginning of this war, a hard-money currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>A judicious system of loans and taxation, combined with our great staples of cotton, tobacco, and naval stores, of which the <rs>Government</rs> should have possessed itself, would have furnished us such resources as would have liberally supplied our wants and planted our public credit upon a basis which would have given us the confidence of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It is useless, however, to speculate as to the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The practical question is, what is best now to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is deeply interested in this question, and, other Governor, I feel it to be my duty, although with hesitation and diffidence, to express my views upon this interesting and important question. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/></item> </list> 
<p>There can be but little objection to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It is well known that a large portion of these articles is in the hands of speculators, who have grown rich in the midst of general suffering and distress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> This scheme would, I am persuaded, act like a charm in the immediate renovation of the public credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>In the reduction of the interest the public will find satisfaction as an evidence of regard to the resources of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Besides, those who will own it will have acquired the ability to do so by enormous profits, and, at most, it can only be regarded as a special tax upon the rich, which has numerous precedents, and which they can well afford to pay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> In the selection of banks we should have agents of tried and approved integrity, thoroughly informed as to the most judicious system of credits, and, with the restoration of a currency now at a heavy premium, and with which the people have long been familiar, we should at once see a revival of confidence that would gladden the heart of every patriot in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>It does seem to me that this scheme would open most auspiciously, and if sustained by liberal taxation and a judicious sale of our great staple, it would dispel the clouds which hang over and obscure our financial system and let in a bright and hopeful future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> In aid of any scheme of finance, however, I regard it as of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance that blockade running, as it is termed, should be conducted by Government alone, or by individuals and Government alone or by individuals and Government combined, and that nothing should be imported except articles of prime necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The effect would be to prevent a large amount of waste and extravagance at home to sharpen our industrial and inventive faculties &mdash; and to accumulate a large amount of sterling exchange abroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> No business should be tolerated which looks to fluctuations in the currency of the country and the stocks of the <rs>Government</rs> for prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Its instincts would naturally seek to aggravate these fluctuations, while all its power would be exerted to appropriate and secure all the advantages incident thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>An organized money power, actively engaged in unsetting the public credit, is a foe greatly to be dreaded, and should be controlled by the sternest legislation.--Perhaps no currency ever existed which had so many agencies at work for its destruction, as that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>And the new scheme </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> of currency and finance which will, I presume, soon take the place of that which now exists, must be strengthened and protected by timely legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>As a part thereof, let all buying and selling of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>; all dealing in State or Confederate currency, or the currency of their several agencies; all stock jobbing in State or Confederate bonds; all receipt of Federal currency of any description, be prohibited, and let those violating such law be severely punished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> It is now time to hasten these remarks to an end. I may seem to have abandoned some of my old cherished opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>But in advocating the maximum &mdash; in seeming to approve the policy of limiting by law the price of money, and in proposing to return to the agency of banks for the management of the public treasure, I renounce no old and cherish opinions, and only yield to the extraordinary circumstances which surround us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> In the suggestions which I have made I have looked for the best means of meeting the peril that is upon us. In the plan which I have presented I have contemplated a system, each measure of which is necessary to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It will be observed that some of them will be more effective by co-operative legislation, which, on the part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, will never be withheld. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> entered into this war with reluctance; but, having entered into it from a sense of duty, she does not mean to sheathe her sword until she has won her liberty and independence, or the boils of her last son shall lie bleaching on her hill-tops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> The year <dateStruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></dateStruct>, being that year which immediately followed the consummation of the <rs>French</rs> alliance, was, by the testimony of all historians, the precise period at which the affairs of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Colonies were nearest rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The people, who had been enthusiastic in support of the war; had very generally cooled down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They had become sick with hope deferred, and tired of a contest which had, apparently, no end. Their currency was in a shocking condition, the continental paper being no better than <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>'s assignats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>They had built great expectations upon the <rs>French</rs> alliance, and had consequently relaxed their own exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>They had been greatly disappointed, having witnessed the failure of the only <num value="2">two</num> joint operations which were undertaken &mdash; that, namely, against <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, and that against <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> &mdash; both of which miscarried through the bull-headed stupidity of the <rs>French Admiral</rs> d'estaing, and from no fault of any <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>From the pinnacle of hope they were precipitated into the abyes of despair, and began to underrate the value of the <rs>French</rs> alliance as much as they had over estimated it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>They turned out to meet the foe with reluctance, and they gave of their means as grudgingly now as they had done liberally at the commencement of the war. Yet, after all, they roused themselves to the task before them, and proved that their despondency was but the languor consequent upon over excitement, not the apathy which goes before death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> The public mind of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is just at this moment in a condition similar to that of the <name>Colonies</name> in <dateStruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Like them, we have been engaged in war for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. Like them, we have had our state of violent excitement, followed by a collapse in proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Like them, we have trusted too much to foreign aid, and are now chewing the end of disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They got it; but, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, they found it of very little value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We have failed to get it; and thus far, at least, we are no worse off than they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>They roused themselves from their momentary apathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We can and <hi rend="italics">must</hi>do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Has any man ever considered what must be the consequence if we do not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/><persName n="Wigfall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Wigfall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wigfall</surname></persName> told us the other day what confiscation meant, and we ought to have known it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It means that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are to take everything in the world we have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>We are not to have a house to shelter us, or a bed to lie on, or a blanket to cover us, or a piece of bread to eat, or anything at all. And subjugation means still more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>It means our negroes masters over us, a provost marshal's office at every cross-road, and no freedom for a white man to walk a couple of <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> without a passport, to be examined by a negro sentinel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>That is what subjugation means &mdash; that is what submission means &mdash; and we cannot avoid it save by resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>There is no alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The enemy seek our utter destruction, and we can only avoid it by resistance to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The currency is the main cause of despondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>But what is the currency if we are subjugated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>What is money, if we loss our liberty?--What is property, if all we have is to be confiscated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>What is it to a man provided he gain the whole world, if he lose his own soul?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>What is it to a man if he gain <num value="1000000">millions</num>, provided he have a master who can take it away from him whenever he may please to do so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The currency is but a secondary consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The Congress of the old Revolution got rid of the <rs>Continental</rs> currency without the faintest approach to a convulsion, although it was done in the midst of the war. The French Council of <num value="500">Five Hundred</num> repudiated a debt of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars in the midst of a war only a little less gigantic than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We are not driven to repudiate, but only to postpone, although, should repudiation even take place, the war would go on as briskly as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The fact is, we cannot stop if we would &mdash; we cannot turn back if we desire it. Like <persName n="Macbeth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Macbeth,nomatch:0"><surname>Macbeth</surname></persName>, we have waded so far in blood that it would be as tedious to return as to keep on. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> Many people are discouraged by the large proportion of Confederate territory which has fallen into possession of the enemy.
