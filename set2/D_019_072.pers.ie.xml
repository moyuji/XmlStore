<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> At a moment when the destinies of the great <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> are trembling in the balance and the <rs>Republic</rs> is menaced with the worst catastrophes of civil was, its Legislature is engaged upon a measure which seems calculated at once to attenuate foreign nations, to embitter domestic strife, and to provide an inexhaustible aliment for the antagonism unhappily subsisting between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The bill called Morrill Tariff Bill is an Act for the establishment of protective duties on a most extravagant scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>If it were designed to condemn the very principles of Free Trade, and to introduce those of Protection, as forming the only true theory of international commerce, it could not be more strongly framed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The duties imposed by the bill are not only immoderately high, but they are levied upon imports of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The articles taxed are not mere luxuries, or commodities entering into the consumption of the opulent alone.--It is upon cotton goods, <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs>, and hardware, that the imposts will fall, and so enormous are the duties proposed that the result can be little short of absolute prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Cutlery is to be taxed upwards of <num value="0.5">50 per cent.</num> in the lowest instance, in the highest nearly <num value="250">250</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>In addition to this, the bill enacts so many complicated arrangements, and throws such interminable obstructions in the way of business, that commerce will be next to impossible under conditions so difficult.--We need not enter into the particulars of the <name>Act</name>, which is said to be scarcely intelligible even to <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> themselves, out we can convey a very good idea of its character and purpose by observing, that if it should be passed it will almost prohibit all imports into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>That, and no less, is the effect anticipated from the measure in New York itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Of our own position under such circumstances, we shall presently speak; but, as the consequences of the measure, would be felt most deeply by the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> themselves, we may give them the precedence in our remarks upon the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> It has been asserted in some quarters with considerable emphasis that <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has entirely misapprehended the controversy between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>We are assured that the slavery question does not constitute the essence of the quarrel; that it has been merely introduced as a blind, or as an instrument of provocation, and that the real point of contention lies in the national Tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>We do not believe in this explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>We are convinced that the contest for territory is the real contest between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, but at the same time it would be impossible to deny that the <rs>South</rs> has always conceived its interests, in the matter of tariffs, to be opposed to those of the <rs>North</rs>, and that its desire to regulate its customs' duties for itself has had a strong influence in determining its recent movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> We cannot conceive of a more humiliating spectacle than to see <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> figuring at the tall of a Northern Confederacy &mdash; the <rs type="role" reg="IsChild">mother of</rs> States and statesman performing the offices of a menial dependant, to a set of States over which her sons have ruled from the beginning of the <rs>Government</rs> by their conceded moral elevation and consummate statesmanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Every day that she remains in the degrading association adds a new stigma to that broad and brilliant escutcheon which, for <measure n="85years" type="date">eighty-five years</measure>, she has borne without a stain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>But it is not as a question of character and fame, or the loss of them, that we are now to consider her association with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It is only as to the question of interest &mdash; pecuniary, material interest-- that we shall at present discuss the contingency of her remaining part of the <rs>Northern Confederation</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The subject is great enough for a volume, and we can only glance at the more frowning features of the most forbidding picture which the <rs>Virginia</rs> mind has ever yet been compelled to contemplate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> None can deny or reject the conclusion that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is a &#x0022;fixed fact. &#x0022;The States that have united to establish the <rs>Government</rs> and Constitution of the &#x0022;<placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>,&#x0022; will never, never, never be induced to surrender their independence, and renew their union with a section which has deliberately repudiated its constitutional obligations; which has systematically insulted them in the <rs>National</rs> councils, and industriously slandered them over the world, and which has defiantly taken possession of the <rs>Government</rs> by a sectional vote, with officers pledged to sectional hostility, and to a sectional policy of administration.--To suppose, then, that these States will ever renew the old connection, is to suppose them at once idiots, cowards, and suicides. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> They have gone, and they have gone forever; and there remain of the old Union <num value="27">twenty seven</num> States--<num value="7">seven</num> slave, (excluding <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>,) and <num value="20">twenty</num> free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> of continuous contact with the <rs>North</rs> will produce stampedes which will depopulate of their slaves, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--leaving in the old Union but <num value="4">four</num> slave States, (<placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>,) and raising the number of free States to <num value="23">twenty-three</num>, which is more than <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>But, under the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <name>States</name> may amend it at will; may pass an amendment, at their pleasure, emancipating every slave in the <num value="4">four</num> remaining slave States, in strict conformity with constitutional forms. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> With this contingency &mdash; this certainty &mdash; staring every <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> slaveholder in the face, is it to be supposed that he will allow his slaves to remain in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> <num value="1">one</num> day longer than the necessary arrangements for getting them away shall require?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>All the inducements of interest, reason, and safety, will drive the slaves from our Commonwealth; and, inasmuch as the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will, in self-defence, forbid their coming within their borders except as immigrants, accompanied by their masters, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will at once lose, not only her <num value="490857">490,857</num> slaves, worth <hi rend="italics"><num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars,</hi> but would also lose from <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to half a <num value="1000000">million</num>, at the least, of her most wealthy and valuable citizens, who would carry away with them all other of their available wealth susceptible of aspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Is <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in a condition to spare suddenly, within the period of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> or less, <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of her present wealth, and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> <num value="1000000">million</num>, at least, of her present <num value="1105196">1,105,196</num> white citizens?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>It would be a moderate estimate to say that, of the labor annually performed in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, at least <num value="0.5">one-half</num> is performed by her half <num value="1000000">million</num> of slaves; and, as it is labor at last which produces the property values which constitute the basis of taxation, it would be moderate to say that the slaves of the <rs>State</rs> annually pay <num value="1000000.5">one million and a half</num> of her annual taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>If the slaves are stampeded, by <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> remaining with the <rs>North</rs>, at least <num value="1000000.5">one million and a half</num> of additional annual taxation at once passes over to the shoulders of the white population, the majority of whom are in the <rs>West</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Is this estimable class of our fellow citizens, whom demagogues as shallow and ignorant as they are depraved, are endeavoring to arraign against the slaveholding interest of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, prepared to accept this necessary and speedy result of submission? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Its credit for borrowing money has sunk so low, that for debentures bearing <num value="0.12">twelve per cent</num> interest, it can scarcely obtain par.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/> After alluding to the great responsibility resting upon him as a member of the <rs>Convention</rs>, he went on to consider the practical issue now before the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>For years there had been a regular course of sectional hostility, which excited the apprehensions of all of us. The election of last <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> resulted in a manner that shook the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> to its very centre, and the people took the necessary measures for meeting the crisis, and had sent a Convention here clothed with powers to make and unmake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The aggressions upon the <rs>South</rs> were no longer to be borne, and he for <num value="1">one</num> was ready to repel them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, on the <date value="02-04">4th of February,</date> was not ready for disunion, but she took a prompt and decided stand against any measures of coercion or force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>When we met here, the choice and purpose of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was to have proper amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, with a view to restore the <rs>Union</rs> upon a basis to secure permanent protection to her rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>It was further her purpose, in case no sufficient guarantees can be secured, to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, and protect herself out of it. What was the proposition of the committee?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>If these permanent guarantees cannot be secured, then, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we have a power to secure our own rights by withdrawing from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>He then alluded to the determination of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> to stay all impediments by way of coercion on the <num value="1">one</num> side or precipitation on the other, while the representatives of the people could deliberate with the calmness of peace, and if possible restore the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The Convention interposed its moral power &mdash; saying to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, you must not use measures to coerce those who have seceded from the <rs>Union</rs>; you must not possess yourself of the forts or the commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>She said to her sister, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, let there be no war; it would be hurtful to those who are deeply interested in your institutions, but are not so impulsive, and want time to reflect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>They had paused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The Government had acknowledged its inefficiency, and we were not now in the danger that we had previously been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>He could not say how long it would be so, though he hoped it might be permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>But we were here to-day, with no external cause for alarm, and enabled to deliberate calmly upon all subjects of agitation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/> He could not agree with those who said this was the moment to secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>It was the very time when we ought to go to work to carry out the wishes of the people, as expressed at the polls on the <date value="02-04">4th of February</date> last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/> Proceeding to discuss the propositions of the committee, he said there must be thorough and efficient guarantees of equality in the <rs>Government</rs>, and of protection in regard to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>He asked his friend from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName>, (<persName n="Holcombe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00288" reg="mostcommon:Holcombe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holcombe</surname></persName>,) if, when those guarantees were secured, we should not have done all our constituents required?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Guarantees of principle, and guarantees of power were the covenants to be considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>He believed that physical guarantees were not demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>The guarantee of <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Magna Charta" type="document">Magna Charta</rs></hi> was at this moment stronger than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Where was the guarantee, except by amendments of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that had been for a moment thought of?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>He alluded to the exceptions of the dual Executive suggested by <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00289" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, and to the dual Judiciary foreshadowed by <persName n="Hunter,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00290" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,C.,M.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, as checks to be interposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>He asked how such checks were to be enforced on a party that recognized no influence of moral power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>The false key of the higher law would still be used to unlock the casket and steal from it its treasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Whenever any gentleman &mdash; the gentleman from <persName><roleName n="Princess">Princess</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName> or the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName> &mdash; could show anything tangible, he would be ready to accept it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>He would say to the gentleman that a human head had been thinking of these guarantees of power, and at a proper time would show how they could be made practicable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Preston,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00292" reg="nearbymention:Preston,Ballard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName></hi> said the gentleman from <persName><roleName n="Princess">Princess</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName> stood alone on his own platform.--He was too slow in the enforcement of his guarantees of power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00293" reg="nearbymention:Wise,O.,Jennings,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName></hi> said he was obliged to be slow, for he had very heavy weights to drag after him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Preston,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00294" reg="nearbymention:Preston,Ballard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName></hi> thought it would be better to press forward with his own burden, and leave others to take care of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>He (<persName n="Preston,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00295" reg="nearbymention:Preston,Ballard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>) could see no efficiency in any guarantees, except by suitable amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="1Section">first section</orgName> of the committee's report, he conceived, covered the question of exact equality, and the <rs>North</rs> must respond aye or no to it. If the response is &#x0022;aye,&#x0022; you have a guarantee of faith for the full and ample protection of the institution in which we are vitally interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>The speaker continued to discuss in a general manner, and somewhat in detail, the propositions of the committee, taking ground similar to those who had preceded him in the advocacy of the report. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/> After pointing out the efficiency of the remedies proposed, he said the cry of &#x0022;inadequacy&#x0022; still came up; we still heard of the deep-seated hatred and sectional hostility existing at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>He asked if we were to get rid of this hostility by flying from it. Due weight, he thought, should be given to the conflicting passions in Congress, which had given an impulse to sectional hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>The slave question, he argued, was at the bottom of it all, but if this cause of agitation could be cut off, much would be done towards restoring the friendly feelings of the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Everything was favorable now to a submission to the demands we were to make of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>It was not to be made in a crouching or an humble attitude; but we were to make, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, an appeal to the <rs>Northern</rs> people &mdash; not to the politicians; and if they were not granted within a reasonable period, we separate from our brothers of the past, and separate forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>This was his idea of true chivalry &mdash; to make of them a firm demand, not in the language of bravado; but to say to them, if you accept, well; if you do not accept, well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Recurring again to the report, he read the demands therein contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>The test is thus proposed to the <rs>North</rs> to be voted upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>If they say &#x0022;aye,&#x0022; said <persName n="Preston,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00296" reg="nearbymention:Preston,Ballard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>, I will accept them as a repentant people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>Everything, he thought, was auspicious for a full, clear, and unequivocal settlement. --They have now an empire, but sit with a barren sceptre in their hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Reason will regain its away, and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s demands will meet a favorable response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Dishonor, disgrace, and overthrow, is now upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Their counsels are distracted and their party divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>The Government is hesitating and tottering in its own weakness, under the certain doom which this Convention pronounces, unless those demands are submitted to which will restore the prosperity of the whole country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/> The propositions are to be sent to the <rs>North</rs> immediately upon the adjournment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>The Conference at <placeName reg="Frankfort, Franklin, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013939">Frankfort</placeName> was not to be entrusted with the settlement of the matter.--This power belonged to the sovereign people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>He had come here for the purpose of carrying out their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>If it became necessary to divide, after a full and fair consultation with the border slave States, then <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> We could go out peacefully and quietly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Although the propositions presented might not be so full as he could desire &mdash; if anything better came up, he would be ready to accept it &mdash; he still thought they were the best we could do. He came from the <rs>West</rs>, and in the name of his loyal people was prepared to make a demand for full security of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>He did not conceive it to be his duty to consult the wishes of the <rs>North</rs> in making demands, but the wishes of the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>He urged gentlemen not to say, where Liberty is, there is my country; but say where my home is, there shall Liberty be. [Applause.] He closed with an appeal to all to stand by the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, and to vindicate every right that belongs to her. His ancestors had fought and died in her defence, and with the help of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> this should be his destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>If, said he, I fall elsewhere, I ask to be brought back to the consecrated earth of his mother <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; to be buried in his own meadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Then it may be said of <persName n="Preston,,Ballard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00297" reg="default:Preston,Ballard,,,"><foreName>Ballard</foreName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>, &#x0022;after life's fitful fever he sleeps well.&#x0022; He would go to the <rs>North</rs> or to the <rs>South</rs>, or to the judgment seat of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in vindication of the rights of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>After an allusion to the eloquence of the gentleman who had preceded him, he said he did not feel as if he was standing alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>He would say to the gentleman, in the friendliness of a brother, that if he could see no other tangible guarantee, he had reached an immedicable condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Was the privilege of catching a runaway negro nothing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>Was the privilege of going to the <placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Territory of Kansas</placeName>, with your property, nothing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>They proposed to pay for fugitive slaves; but money was no compensation for the surrender of a principle.
