<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Arrived at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we were marched through <num value="1">one</num> side of the city to our destination, the chaplains and surgeons glad at their arrival, having been fed with the idea that they would be passed through at once to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The following will show how near we came to the truth of our hopes, and how exceedingly green we had been to be so easily gulled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Upon our nearing the prison, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing that attracted attention was a sign reaching out from the corner of the building on which were the ominous and not very classic words, &#x0022;<persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName> &#x0026; Son, ship chandeliers and grocers.&#x0022; The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> sight, all the window openings in the part of the building facing us filled with human heads, rising <num value="1">one</num> above the other, which we soon recognized as belonging to Union prisoners, and our fellow sufferers who had preceded us. Catching the eye of a captain of cavalry, I was greeted with a peculiar and expressive motion, in military phrase, a movement in <num value="1">one</num> time and <num value="2">two</num> motions, thus, <num value="1">one</num> had conveyed in the head, and immediately the thumb nail brought into contact with the nail on the other hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> And now, above the din of the guards and the noise of the boys in the streets, rings out the cry, &#x0022;Fresh fish, fresh fish,&#x0022; and that, too, as we perceived, from the building itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>What can it mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Ah, we, too, soon learned that by this expression information was conveyed to all prisoners that new occupants of the prison were arriving, new sharers in <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName>'s honors, new devotees at the shrine of her hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Another cry from some brave soul, this time of warning: &#x0022;Look out for your money!&#x0022;--Looking up, the windows were vacant, and we could only conceive of what it meant, or think that some <num value="1">one</num> was making sport of our misfortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Some few took warning and concealed their money as best they could; the most of us being unsophisticated youths and dreaming of no harm, neglected the precaution, and became the victims of misplaced confidence. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I have before said they would lie; I must now add they will steal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Everything of value was taken from us &mdash; canteens, haversacks, gum blankets, in some cases our woolen blankets, our money and valuables, private papers and pocket diaries, lists of dead and wounded, and even last messages from some brave martyrs to their friends, nothing being retained but the few things that seemed to be a part of ourselves and necessary to conceal our nakedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>For some hours the new-comers enjoy very little quiet, or time for reflection, as the news is recounted again and again, until it would seem that all hands must have memorized it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Is he dry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Does he look around and ask timidly where he is to sleep?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He is pointed to the dirty floor and told to help himself to any unoccupied spot, and be sure not to stir up the bugs too much. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> If on the march he preserved his courage and flow of spirits, and carried a bold and defiant front to his enemies, here the same reason does not exist, and crawling away in the dark, he can think until his heart aches, or he wishes himself dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>If thoughts of home have, with persistent efforts, been thrust-aside, or strangled in the birth, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>here and now, home, friends, wife and children, all that is precious and dear to man's social nature, pour in with overwhelming power, seemingly determined to revenge themselves upon us for our treating them so slightingly before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Has he a blanket?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>He spreads it down in the selected spot; if not, he lies upon the bare floor, and while sleep forsakes his eyes, and slumber his eyelids, runs the gauntlet of his thoughts, upbraiding, or fearful misgivings of the future, or shifts from side to side, to relieve the hard pressure of his aching bones, his nostrils penetrated with a stench at once strange and almost insufferable, until he could well fancy himself in some charnel house, or among all the elements of nauseousness in the universe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> Does he thus fall off into an uneasy slumber, overtaxed nature demanding repose, then he is startled by a loud noise, and after several repetitions hears the words: &#x0022;<rs n="Post 3">Post Number Three</rs>, and all is well.&#x0022; The guards are vigilant and numerous, escape being almost impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Is it well with him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Oh, what a mockery to his feelings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Has his mind been wrought upon by tales of <hi rend="italics">moving</hi> pathos and eloquence, then he in conception is covered with <hi rend="italics">lively</hi> evidences of the degradation of those around him, and the gloomy prospect of sharing their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Again he sinks to rest, but the constant pattering of feet as the sleepless ones move around the room, praying for the morning light, or some heavy sleeper snores loud enough to awaken the conscience even of a rebel, or some <num value="1">one</num> less happy, startled by some terrible vision, screams but with terror, forbids the coveted luxury. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Very timidly and with a shocked modesty, he steals a glance at himself, and oh, horror of horrors, just under his eye he beholds something not like <num value="1">one</num> of Pharoah's lean kine, but a something, a moving mass, somewhat gray in appearance and aldermanic in proportions, which startles him, until gathering courage a friendly boot rallies to the rescue. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> With an appetite sharpened by long fasting he surrounds the table, but hardly enters the combat until he learns that he must spare his rations or he will have nothing for dinner and supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Thus warned he desists, still hungry, and, indeed, the more eager from having aroused a slumbering nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>He is hungry, others are hungry, they all are hungry &mdash; have been for days and weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> What does this mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Simply a distribution of soup made in <num value="1">one</num> of the large ketties steaming upon the stove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>However small the appetite of the prisoner, if well be could eat the whole of his day's rations at <num value="1">one</num> meal and look around for more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>At the time of which I speak the officers were not allowed to purchase or receive any food but that furnished by the authorities as the daily ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The bread very unpalatable and unwholesome; the beef oftentimes tainted and sometimes evidently diseased, as we could see where rumors had been extracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>If in lieu of rice we obtained beans or peas, we received with them no small quantity of animated life, in the form of worms, fat and plump.

<head>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> The persistent lies of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals about the starvation and cruel treatment of their prisoners in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> are only intended to blow up the declining war spirit in the <rs>North</rs>, and to justify themselves upon the pretext of an abominable falsehood, in inflicting new cruelties upon our unhappy captives in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We have made inquiries upon the subject which satisfy us that all is done for the support and comfort of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> multitude which the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> is capable of doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>A fact came to our notice yesterday morning which will be a striking illustration of the true state of things to all fair minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Several persons of respectable standing in this community were endeavoring to obtain a small quantity of some portions of the beef which have been permitted to be sold at the commissary shops to the general public, but were informed by the man in charge that they could not have it, as it was now required by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Here are our people dented provisions for themselves and their children to feed these <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who have come to destroy us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We do not mention this in the way of complaint; on the contrary we give the <rs>Government</rs> credit for its merciful disposition, but this single fact sufficiently disproves the base and malignant falsehood that we are seeking to starve the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, when, in reality, it is our own people that are in danger of starving in order that these prisoners may be fed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> To any <num value="1">one</num> willing to listen to reason and truth, it must be apparent that <num value="13000">thirteen thousand</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners thrust upon a community already overcrowded, and having great difficulty to provide the plainest articles of food for its own tables, cannot expect, with the best dispositions on our part' to fare sumptuously every day. We know people, once in affluence, who would be glad to be assured of as liberal a daily provision as these <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It may be that their food is plain, and not abundant, but it is as good and as plentiful as, with our straightened means, we can supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Liars ought to have good memories, and to keep up a show at least of consistency, and therefore we would suggest to the mendacious <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> scribes who accuse us of deliberately starving our prisoners, whether, if it be true, as they daily assert, that the people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> are threatened with the horrors of famine, it may not be that the alleged famine among their prisoners is involuntary?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>If we are starving ourselves, how can we keep them from starving?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>But the truth is, that, though straightened in our own means of life, we are doing as well for our prisoners as for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><num value="70">Seventy</num> bullocks a day are sacrificed for their commissariat, and bread in proportion to their numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Our own people, as we know of our own personal knowledge, are in some cases denied meat for their own families, because it is necessary for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Thus much we say, not because we consider any explanation due to our enemies, or likely to be satisfactory, but because the facts ought to be known, in vindication of our own character, and in justice to our own prisoners whom they wish to harass and torture upon a false and malignant pretext. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> In regard to accommodation it is undoubtedly true that we are deficient in the means of comfortably accommodating the multitude on our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We had no room in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> before the war for a large surplus population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Since the war our population has been doubled; people who once lived in large mansions are glad to get <num value="2">two</num> rooms, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has been compelled to occupy for the uses of State many of our principal public edifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Artisans and builders having been drawn upon largely for the army, very little building has been going on since the war commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The consequence is, that after packing all our spare factories with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners, we have been compelled to encamp the others on <placeName reg="Belle Isle, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,2161656">Belle Isle</placeName>, which is the most agreeable of places in summer, but not better in winter than the usual winter quarters of soldiers.--What can we do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Arrangements have been made to send them away as fast as we can find places for them in the interior of the country, and in the meantime they must submit to a disagreeable position with the best philosophy they can, knowing that it is the result of necessity and not of wanton cruelty on our part. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> We have abstained from referring to the unspeakable horrors which our prisoners have suffered in Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> and other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisons, because <num value="2">two</num> wrongs do not make a right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>But we may at least say to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners that if they suffer here it is not our fault, who cannot help it; but the fault of their own Government, who will not exchange prisoners &mdash; who will only send us back our sick and wounded men, and when we return others in the same condition, basely and of wanton malice pretend that their sufferings are the result of starvation in Southern prisons. </p> </div3> </div2>
