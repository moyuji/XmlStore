<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The army is now lying quietly in camp, with but <unclear></unclear> excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Every few days a brigade or division is sent forward to destroy some part of the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Most of it within reach of the army has been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They tear up the rails and then, pile them together in large heaps along the road and when some <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> have thus been piled together the whole is fired at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The boys like this fun very much.--<placeName key="the cumberland river" n="1.000 19" reg="">The Cumberland</placeName> tunnel I understand, has also been destroyed in the last few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It will certainly take <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ingenuity some time to clear this tunnel, for but few can get in to work at it at once, whereas bridges and such like can be formed miles away and carried to their destination already fitted together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This, together with the partial destruction of the <rs type="place">Chesapeake and Ohio canal</rs>, will in a measure blockade <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for a while. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Although I do not approve of soldiers finding fault with the manner in which those at the head of affairs in our Confederacy see fit to control their monetary matters, yet there is <num value="1">one</num> thing which, situated as I am, I have frequent opportunity of witnessing, to my sorrow, and to the no little inconvenience of the soldiers, as well as the loyal citizens, in this section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I allude to the currency of Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There has been no law passed making Confederate bills lawful tender throughout the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The soldiers are paid only in Confederate money; and many of the citizens &mdash; good Southern men, too &mdash; refuse to take it except at a considerable discount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Virginia Treasury notes are the only currency that is taken by all parties here, whereas, if Congress, at its late session, had made Confederate paper a lawful tender, no <num value="1">one</num> would refuse to take it without laying himself Able to lase the whole amount of his debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I know of good Southern families who heretofore have not <unclear>scrupled</unclear> to take the <rs>National</rs> bills, and who therefore have no other kind of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They are now informed by the butchers and bakers that they can get no more meat or bread unless they pay <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, or make a considerable discount on their Confederate, money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Now, this is a grievance which it is hard for the soldiers and loyal citizens to bear, and it is a subject which it seems to me should demand the attention of those in power.--As Congress has already adjourned, I see no better way than for the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commanders</rs> to publish some order with regard to it, and not suffer the soldiers hard-earned money to be discounted <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> before he can purchase any necessary article. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> It is a sight revolting to humane feelings to witness the manner in which the soldiers who fall victims to their country's cause in the hospitals of this town are conveyed to their last resting place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I saw yesterday morning a cart conveying <num value="3">three</num> of them to their graves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Their coffins were made in the shape of common goods boxes, of rough unplanned plank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><num value="2">Two</num> of these filled the body of the cart; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> was placed upon the top of these, and upon the head of this sat the boy who drove the cart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It same trotting briskly up the street, in real business style, with a large dog barking at the nose of the horse as it passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I could not but shudder at such a sight, in the midst of refined people, and think to myself that surely it must be owing to the negligence of some <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I know not why the <rs>Confederacy</rs> cannot furnish decent coffins for her soldiers, in a country where nothing but energy is required to obtain anything that is wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Such scenes are excusable at such points as <placeName reg="Valley Mountain, Hampshire, West Virginia" key="tgn,2742479">Valley Mountain</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2653751" n="1.000 2" reg="sewell mountain, fayette, west virginia">Sewell Mountain</placeName>, but not at all so at <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>To make this, a bad matter, worse, I have just been informed by a friend, just returned from the burying-ground to attend the remains of <num value="1">one</num> in whom we all at this hospital feel a special interest, that there were no graves dug, and that there were no lass than <num value="41">forty one</num> coffins lying on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Some of these had lain there for several days, and seemingly with little prospect of being interred at an early hour. --Seeing the state of affairs, my friend tells me that he and some <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> more, who attended the corpse to its last resting place, went to work, dug a grave, and interred it decently before leaving.--There are several <num value="100">hundred</num> soldiers stationed here on <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost guard</orgName>, which proves that there is no lack of means to inter decently all soldiers who may here pay their last respects to their country, and that the fault must lie with some <num value="1">one</num> whose duty it is to attend to such affairs.

<head>Intervention.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> The <hi rend="italics">Enquirer,</hi> of yesterday in the course of some remarks upon our article of the day before, with regard to the rumors of foreign into vention, which were rife in the city a few days ago, says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> &#x0022;We know that many consider it damaging to lay before the people any expectations of probabilities which contemplate the close of the war. They think it will enfeeble their energies and stimulate impatience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>But this should not be the effect, and it is not the natural effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The tendency of hope is to encourage and to energize new efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Hope fills the shout with which many a gallant army rushes into battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is that which enables men to bear all manner of trial and hardship&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Enquirer,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> All this is true enough with regard to hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>But when the end of hope is disappointment, then it were better that hope had never existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The reaction is always worse than the stimulant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It depends in a great degree, too, upon what sort of hope it may be &mdash; whether rational or not &mdash; whether it ought to be encouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The sort of hope that would lead men into danger, with the expectation of a miracle to save them, could not, we should think, be a sentiment which a wise statesman would encourage in a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Just such a hope we take this of intervention to be. If it ought to <q>&#x0022;energize our efforts.&#x0022;</q> It most certainly has not done so. On the contrary, it made us relax, from dependence upon the flattering tale it told, and the consequences were nearly fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>We hardly need repeat the fable of the countryman who called upon <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName> to draw his wagon out of the mud. The sort of hope that we indulged in last year was analogous to that of the countryman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>We stood with folded arms and called on <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName> would not come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> That kind of hope which is placed in our own exertions is the hope we ought to encourage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It is that which swells the fury of the soldier when he goes into battle and makes him irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It is <unclear></unclear> hope of assistance from <unclear></unclear> distant quarter, <unclear></unclear> some remote contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is based upon <unclear></unclear> heart and his own strength, and he knows <unclear></unclear> they will go. Self-reliance is the true <unclear></unclear> upon which to found all hopes of success.--<unclear></unclear> <num value="2">two</num> men of equal strength engage in a fisticuffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The <num value="1">one</num> hopes they will be parted by the bystanders and therefore does not fight with half his natural energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The other pitches in as thought there was no person in existence except himself and his antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Both have strong hopes; the <num value="1">one</num> in intervention the other in his own strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Which will be victorious! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> Our object is to encourage hope, lest that <unclear>ies</unclear> of hope only which springs out of self-reliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It is vain to say that the hope of assistance from abroad will not relax our energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It has done it before, and it will do it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>In the war of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Revolution the year after the alliance with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, our hopes were so high, and our energize so much relaxed, that it was very near proving fatal to the cause of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>And so it was last year with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.
