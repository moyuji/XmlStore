<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>--It is asserted that on <name>Thursday</name> last, immediately preceding the issue of the orders for Navy and Army movements, a messenger from <persName n="Houston,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00297" reg="mostcommon:Houston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName> arrived in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and had a prolonged interview with the <rs>President</rs>, delivering a letter from the <rs>Governor</rs>, which rumor says was a requisition for troops and munitions of war, to enable him to repel the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexicans</rs> and <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, who were threatening to invade the <rs>Texan</rs> frontier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It is therefore probable that instead of for coercion they go at the call of the <rs>Governor</rs> of <num value="1">one</num> or the seceded States, who, although deposed by the <rs>Convention</rs>, repudiates their action, and still claims to exercise all the powers and functions of the position to which he was elected by the people. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> These surmises may be or may not be correct, but in view of the declarations of the <rs>President</rs> that no act of coercion or irritation is intended, are most likely to prove the true version. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/> I think that our political &#x0022;complications&#x0022; are fast drawing to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Yesterday was a day of great excitement, from various significant signs in and about the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>In the first place, the firing into that schooner gave some uneasiness with the timid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>When the firing took place, <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00599" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> sent a boat with the white flag asking permission of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00600" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> to visit the vessel, which was granted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/> Large supplies of provisions were sent down to the different stations on yesterday and the day before, which showed that something was expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>The reason of this, I understand to be, that all supplies are to be cut off from <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00601" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,W.,S.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, and if so, he may say we shall not pass with provisions, but we have on the <rs type="place">Islands</rs> now plenty for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. I understand that supplies were stopped to-day, but I cannot, up to <time value="6pm">6 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>I do not believe he will surrender unless his Government orders it, and, as I have all along said, I do not believe they will order it.--The truth is, the old (I was about to say <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>,</hi> but I will never again associate that dear name with the rotten and treacherous party now in power,) Government &mdash; the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Government --has become a stench in our nostrils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>We put no confidence on earth in what they say. They declare they have no intention of reinforcing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Everything goes to prove that false; and I will predict that <persName n="Pickens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00603" reg="mostcommon:Pickens,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickens</surname></persName> will be reinforced in a week, and that an attempt will be made here, too. I also predict, and you mark it, that <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00604" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,W.,S.,,:1"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> will not come out of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> until he is shelled out. Mark another thing: that he will be shelled out in less than a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>We cannot bear it longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Our sons, brothers, clerks and mechanics are all away from business, and we do not intend to bear with it longer.--<num value="3">Three</num> <rs n="fire engines" type="product">fire-engines</rs> were sent to <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Should the soldiers' quarters be fired by ball or shell, we will put it out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> If I mistake not the signs of the times in your State, the submissionists in your Convention and State had better &#x0022;stand off the track.&#x0022; It is reported here to-day that the <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs> has hoisted the secession flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>I have not seen it in that paper or in yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/> Guns have been firing all day &mdash; practicing, I suppose.
