<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> In a &#x0022;Catechism for the use of the <rs n="Methodist" type="religion">Methodist</rs> Missions,&#x0022; by <persName n="Capers,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Capers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Capers</surname></persName>, is a &#x0022;Chapter on the <name>Crucifixion</name>,&#x0022; from which we extract the following passage: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> &#x0022;It was as it the world of sinners were in league with the world of fallen angels to do the utmost wrong to the <rs type="role" reg="IsFather">Son of</rs> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the seed of the woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We overlook ourselves when we ascribe it all to the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/><persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> could not have been crucified at all if a Gentile Governor had not given sentence against him; and this he did, protesting as he did it that it was unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Those were Gentile soldiers, too, who put the crown of thorns upon his head, mocked him, smote him, and spit upon him. The world was there, as if come together to lay both hands &mdash; the hand of the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> and the hand of the <name>Gentiles</name> &mdash; on the head of the victim who was to bear their sine away to the land of forgetfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The deed actually done was if <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> and Gentiles, priests and people, high and low, rich and poor, Pharisees, Saducees, Herodians, men of all sects, and men of no sect at all offended at the purity of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, would rid themselves by violence of his teaching and example; too true, as they were, to be disproved, and too holy for them to endure.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> If the <name>Gentile</name> world would bear in mind such truths as these, its propensities for persecution would receive a salutary check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It had its representatives in the most fearful tragedy of all time, and if it had been in the place of the nation which caused <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> to be crucified, would have done precisely the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jewish</rs> people, in their whole history, and in no part of it more than their crowning crime, are a fair type of the whole race of man. It was not the sins of the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> alone, but the sins of all mankind, that caused the great sacrifice of Calvary, and sprinkled the blood of the <rs>Atoning Lamb</rs> upon the throne of Divine Justice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> &#x0022;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,&#x0022; was the dying prayer of the <rs type="role" reg="IsFather">Son of</rs> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Do Gentiles prove themselves good Christians by refusing to forgive as <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> has forgiven?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Do they remember, when the word Jew is terms of bitter reproach and derision, that the <rs>Divine Founder</rs> of their faith was of the seed of <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>, and that all his Apostles were likewise <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>?--Do they remember that they not only were the chosen people of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, but that according to the plain teachings of both the <rs>Old</rs> and New Testaments, and the universal opinion of the <rs>Christian Fathers</rs>, when the consummation of all things approaches, they are to be restored to the truth and be again His chosen people, and unto them shall the fullness of the <name>Gentiles</name> come? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They have contributed as liberally, both in money and men to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, in proportion to their numbers, as any religious denomination.--Their soldiers are among the bravest in our ranks, and if there are some among them, mostly of foreign birth, who have sought refuge from conscription in other lands, how many native Confederates after making vast fortunes, have done the same, and are now serenely basking in the coal fires of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>. </p>
