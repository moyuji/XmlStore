<head>The revolution in <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The insurrection in <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName> has now become a national rising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The isolated resistance of a few bands of desperate conscripts has developed into a revolution which tasks all the strength of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> to make head against it. The only trustworthy information which reaches this country of the progress of the movement, in the shape of telegrams from the <name>Austrian</name> and Prussian frontiers, is necessarily very imperfect, and somewhat confining.--We are told of a great many fights between parties of military and insurgents, which say very little, except that the insurrection extends over a very wide area.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This much, however, may be said with some certainly, that the insurgents have, on the whole, had for a few days the advantage, and are now beginning to lose it; that they are far better provided with arms than could have been expected, and that they are commanded by officers of some experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A rough notion of the seat of the conflict may be given by describing a crescent extending on the <num value="1">one</num> band from the point of junction of the <name>Austrian</name> and Prussian frontiers a little to the northeast of Cracow, passing thence by the frontier of Gallican, and then by the frontier between <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> proper and <persName n="Poland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Poland,nomatch:0"><surname>Poland</surname></persName> to the <name>Prussian</name> frontier again, directly to the north of <placeName reg="Warsaw, Gallatin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041838">Warsaw</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Within the whole of the district embraced by these lines, that is to say, by far the larger part of the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>, the insurrection is general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It extends, however, beyond the frontier into <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> itself; and it seems probable that it will very soon, to its certain destruction, extend over the <name>Prussian</name> and <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> frontiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In fact, the insurrection seems to have a stronger hold at the junction of the <name>Prussian</name> and <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> frontiers than anywhere else although, it has also spread over the whole of the provinces of Sandomier and Lublin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The Prussian Government, which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was not much <unclear>urbed</unclear> is now, it seems seriously alarmed, and troops are pouring into Silesian, at the southwest corner of which province the danger seems to threaten most.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Later accounts speak of part of Western Prussian as in a very excited state. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Modest protests on behalf of possibility and the nature of things would be denounced as malignant heresies, and the world would be called to take notice that the middle classes and the dissenting preachers were exempt from the odious prejudices of their responsible countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The brawlers of the <rs>Emancipation Society</rs> have gratified their own love of noise and clap trap, but they have not stirred <name>English</name> opinion, and they have even failed to impose on their friends in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It is fortunate that their insignificance is fully appreciated in a country which will shortly be controlled in its policy, if not in its administration, by the habitual and persistent allies of the <rs>Southern</rs> slave owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Democratic agitators would not be slow to complain that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was demanding the violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and promoting a policy which must be utterly inconsistent with the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.
