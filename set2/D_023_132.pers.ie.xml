<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> Why is it that wherever <num value="1">one</num> goes, in all parts of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> always finds, thoroughly as I believe the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> is detested in this country, every man sympathizing strongly with the <name>Southerners</name>, and wishing them all success?--[Cheers.] I do not beg the question, but all I can say is, that so far as my experience goes, throughout the length and breadth of the land, wherever I have travelled, I have never met the man who has not at once said, <q> &#x0022;My wishes are with the <name>Southerners</name>&#x0022;</q> Why is that ? I think there is more than <num value="1">one</num> reason for it. In the first place, the good sense of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> has shown them that the question of slavery must be entirely eliminated from the discussion; that it is altogether a thing apart; and that it is mere hypocrisy and fraud to try to introduce it. There is no reference to the question whatever in considering the relative position of the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> or the relative position of this country with reference to those <num value="2">two</num> belligerents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> Then why is it that we sympathize with the <rs>South</rs>, as I venture to think, from the way in which you have remarked, you agree with me that we all do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We do so for these reasons--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, they have fought, to do them justice, with a degree of gallantry almost unexampled, under circumstances of the utmost difficulty, under every description of privation; they have fought like heroes for their homes, their wives, and their children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>[Cheers.] That alone is enough to enlist the sympathies of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, and I trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the time will never come when it will not enlist their sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>But there is still a stronger feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The turn of events have resolved into this: <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> love liberty, and the <rs>Southerner</rs> is not only fighting for life but that which is deared than life &mdash; his liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>[Hear, hear] He is fighting for his home, for his liberty; he is fighting against <num value="1">one</num> of the most grinding, <num value="1">one</num> of the most galling, <num value="1">one</num> of the most irritating attempts to establish tyrannical government that ever disgraced the history of <hi rend="bold">the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>[Cheers.]</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> I venture to think that in itself is sufficient ground for what I believe is the universal sympathy, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, which is felt on the present occasion toward the men of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>This frightful struggle has been going on for nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, and I would ask whether it is possible in history to find records of such attempts at the establishment of an individual tyranny as is to be found in the history of the last <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>There is no doubt that the great mass of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> loathe tyranny in all its shapes, but they loathe more especially the description of tyranny which has been practiced on the inhabitants of the <rs>Northern States</rs> during the last wo years by what is called a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>And if that alone were not sufficient to explain the strong feeling in favor of the <rs>South</rs> which exists in this country, there is a tenfold stronger reason for it, and that is in the downright barbarism and brutality &mdash; I use strong words but I contend that they are justified by the circumstances, and I am prepared to abide by them &mdash; which has characterized those who have had the conduct of affairs in the <rs>Northern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> I have already adverted to the proclamation which was lately issued, as a tardy and lame attempt to induce the people of this country to believe that this is an <q> &#x0022;abolition&#x0022;</q> war, because, after all, all their legislation, and all their acts, have reference to us, and our opinion of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>They think of nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The only idea they have is what is said of them in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and they have not heard much that will please them, I should think, for some time past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>[Laughter] The proclamation really was a piece of clap trap in the first place to catch the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Look at its real meaning and its real bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The object of it was to encourage and arm the blacks, to infuriate unfortunate and misguided people, to put arms into their hands, and to generate, merely for purposes of aggression upon men whom they cannot defeat in fair fight, <num value="1">one</num> of the most horrible massacres of old men and women and children that ever disgraced the annals of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>This is the proclamation which has made such a sensation during the last few weeks, and that is enough in itself to disgust every honest man with the author of such a document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>But there is worse than that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> I ask you, is there anything upon record that can be compared to the barbarities practiced by a certain <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> [hear] upon the defenceless inhabitants of New Orleans?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Recollect that the inhabitants of that unfortunate town are reduced to old men, women, and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Surely, in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, and in a country that claims the slightest right to call itself a civilized nation, the position of old men, women and children would have established some claim to sympathy and tolerance, at least, if not to kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>But what has been the effect on this barbarian?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Why, there is no act of brutality which he has not been prepared to advocate and practice against defenceless women, and he has followed that up by encouraging, in every possible way, the butchery of the whites by the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>This has been done in cold blood, and in open defiance of all humanity and of all civilization; and I say, that so long as such acts are performed, and are avowed by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, they cease to have a claim to be ranked among civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>[Hear, hear] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> I ventured to think that there is but <num value="1">one</num> rational, <num value="1">one</num> just, <num value="1">one</num> beneficial course, for this country to pursue, and that is at once to recognize publicly and officially the independence of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>It appears now to be perfectly hopeless that the <rs>North</rs> should ever conquer the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>There is no prospect of a termination of this horrible sacrifice of human life except by the recognition of the <rs>Southern States</rs> by this country and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; and, therefore, upon that ground alone, I venture to urge it. What has been the effect of this war in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> upon an immense portion of the population of the country, and what is the amount of the distress which is now endured, and that with an amount of patience, forbearance, sound judgment, and good feeling which I say reflects honor upon the people of this country generally? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> What is the amount of distress which is being endured, and which can be attributed solely to the effects of this war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Why, it is incalculable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>We are told day after day that the numbers of those who are suffering are increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>There seems to be no limit to the extent of it. We are told that if cotton were once introduced that distress would cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>I say again, with precedent in our favor, with the existence of enormous distress in this country &mdash; and putting aside, as I do, a mere piece of hypocrisy and absurdity, the introduction of the element of slavery into the discussion &mdash; I say, without reference to party, without reference to anything but what I believe to be indispensable to the welfare and character of this country, that we are bound at once to recognize the independence of the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>He arrived at the road just as the head of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> column was approaching, and, selecting a good position, succeeded in pouring a very destructive fire into them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The General arranged his men on the side of the road, and placing himself at the head of the line instructed them to retain their fire until he gave the signal, which was to be the firing of his own pistol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The signal was given, and immediately <num value="300">three hundred</num> double-barrelled guns were discharged right into the midst of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> horde. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We are by no means sure that the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would even then have <unclear> </unclear> upon the recognition of the <rs>Confederate</rs> <unclear></unclear> There are many reasons why they should wish to keep clear of the war, while wishing us every possible degree of success.
