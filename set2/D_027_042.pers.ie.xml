<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The city was rife with rumors yesterday in connection with military operations on the north side of the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It was known that skirmishing was going on between our forces and those of the enemy, but of the location and results, everybody, even the officials, seemed to be profoundly ignorant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A report prevailed that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were attempting a flank movement on the <placeName key="tgn,2275605" n="1.000 10" reg="Darbytown, Wayne, Pennsylvania">Darbytown</placeName> road, and that our troops were gallantly resisting their advance; but as the evening wore on, it was settled in the minds of the knowing ones that the location of the hostilities was <persName n="White,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><surname>White</surname></persName>'s tavern, on the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road, <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, and <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> <offset>northeast</offset> of  <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It was reported that the enemy was repulsed with considerable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The object of this movement on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> is involved in mystery, but if they seriously meditate an advance upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by that route, they will be as signally foiled as they have been in every movement since the opening of the campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Intelligence was received last evening of the death of <persName n="Chambliss,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Chambliss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Chambliss</surname></persName>, in the fight of yesterday; but we have information which leads us to doubt the truth of this report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It appears that his <orgName n="Cavalry Brigade" type="brigade">cavalry brigade</orgName> was sent forward to relieve some of our infantry, who were in danger of being flanked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They accomplished all that they were sent to perform, but <persName n="Chambliss,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Chambliss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Chambliss</surname></persName>, while gallantly leading a charge, got within the skirmish line of the enemy, and is believed to have been wounded and taken prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><persName n="Chambliss,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Chambliss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Chambliss</surname></persName> was formerly colonel of the <orgName type="regiment" key="13VACav">Thirteenth Virginia cavalry</orgName>, and is a native, we believe, of <placeName reg="Greensville, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002425">Greensville county</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The reported death of <persName n="Hampton,General,Wade,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Wade</foreName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> was not credited in official quarters, and we may safely pronounce it entirely without foundation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> After the above was written, we learn that an official dispatch was received last night, which states that the enemy yesterday made a determined attack on our line between the <rs type="place">Darbytown</rs> and <address><street n="Charles City road">Charles City roads</street></address>, and at <num value="1">one</num> time broke through; but he was repulsed and our original positions were re-occupied. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>From <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The quiet on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> still remains unbroken, and public attention is almost solely directed to operations on the north side of the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The number of troops thrown across by the enemy is not positively known, though there is no doubt that it is quite large, and composed of cavalry, artillery and infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Deserters say that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has lately been removing his troops with great rapidity, and that he has now left in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> only about <num value="1">one</num> full corps.

<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The opening of the fight.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> As the sun rose on the following day, we discovered that the fleet had, during the night, hauled off to the eastward and contracted their line into a semi-circle, nearly due south of the fort and within not more than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the main inlet into the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Their appearance was quite martial; the broad pennons that floated to the breeze from the top of their dark turrets seemed to bid defiance to the diminutive forces that were manning the ramparts of <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName>, and called up a sneering comparison between their bulky forms and the almost puny size of our own little fleet, which was coolly expecting the advance of their <unclear></unclear> adversaries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> At <time value="6:30">thirty minutes past six</time> a signal shot was fired from the extreme <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of the <rs>Federals</rs>; that shot falling short south-east of the fort, was soon after followed by a shell, which burst over the fort, sending its death-dealing fragments over the officers' quarters outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>By that time, all was movement and activity within the walls; the officers, rushing to their several posts, were leading their detachments to the-southern bastions, and the firm, steady tramp of their brave followers was the only sound heard through the stillness of the morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The fleet then commenced their forward movement, and closing up on their centre, so as to bring the leading ships of the extreme right and left wings abreast, soon formed themselves into <hi rend="italics">echelons</hi> and made their way towards the head of the pass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> In front, westward, rode the <rs>Tecumseh</rs>, a doubleturretted monster, vomiting fire through <num value="8">eight</num> apertures constantly revolving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>On her left a large-sized frigate, and in their wake the balance of the fleet, each succeeding file covering in part that which preceded it. To those who look only to the outward appearance of things, this array looked quite martial; but for those to whom the respective forces of the contending parties were known, it lost all its prestige, and derived no other interest but that resulting from the really beautiful architecture of the <rs>Federal</rs> navy, sailing up with a force of over <num value="300">three hundred</num> guns of the largest calibre to overpower a fort and fleet mounting not more than <num value="40">forty</num> of vastly inferior weight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> It was then <time value="7:30am">7:30 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Then a calm deep voice is heard, and the command, &#x0022;Commence firing,&#x0022; rings along our bastions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It is answered with a cheer &mdash; a soul-stirring cheer &mdash; that comes from the willing and devoted breasts of the brave men who have for over <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> stood like statues by the side of their guns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> Yet, the frightful example before them deters them not, and, rushing on under increased steam, they advance, coming through the pass, till the foremost ones have already presented their broadsides to the western flank of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But there, instead of being able to concentrate our whole fire on them, the traverses are so awkwardly disposed that the guns of the southern bastions cannot be brought to bear on the channel, there being no room to swing them to the right; and thus comes the illustration of their off-repeated prophecies, as to the folly to provide the fort with defences calculated only to repel the enemy whilst off in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, instead of tempting him to come right abreast of the fort, and there pouring in our deadly volleys. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> Thus, as each succeeding file passes out of the range of our heaviest metal, the brave cannoniers are compelled to turn their muzzles away from it and direct their fire on the succeeding file; so that at no time more than <num value="5">five</num>, and sometimes less than <num value="3">three</num> guns are engaged in impeding the progress of the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>But even under such disadvantages the brave defenders of the fort give not up the contest; and after having received the fire of the ramparts, the enemy still have to run the gauntlet at the <orgName n="Water Battery" type="battery">water battery</orgName>, which frowns at the foot of the south<name>west</name> and <name>west</name>ern bastions. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The statement of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> could not but foresee, even at that early period, that if the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> continued uninterrupted for a century, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> must lose, never to be regained, her <hi rend="italics">prestige</hi> as mistress of the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>They foresaw that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must be the ruling power upon that favorite element &mdash; that element from whose besom had sprung so much of that wealth, and that greatness, which were at that time the envy and the admiration of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>They foresaw that her manufactures would be driven out of all the markets of the world; that her commerce would decline as her manufactures gave way, and that her colonies would lie at the mercy of the gigantic power which they saw rising in the <rs>Western</rs> hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It was with them, as it has been with their successors from that time to this, an object of the greatest importance to effect the disintegration of this mighty empire, which, if allowed to expand to its legitimate proportions, must end by overshadowing the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>From the moment of our separation the intrigues of <name>British</name> agents in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> were incessant; and during the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> they very nearly succeeded in detaching the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Indeed, all Yankeedom, with a very few honorable exceptions, was at that time a nest of traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The war bore hard on their interests, which were largely involved in the trade with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and her colonies, and no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were ever known to hesitate between treason to their country and treason to their interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>We escaped that trial; but there was another in reserve for us, which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> knew well how to aggravate, and which she did aggravate until it became altogether intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>We allude, of course, to the slavery question, which her emissaries have been the most forward to agitate, and which they prompted the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Abolitionists to agitate until they succeeded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> Yet, the mere dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> was but half the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>If the separation should be peaceful, the danger to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was still the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would still drive her manufactures out of the market, and the <rs>Confederates</rs> would still surpass <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> and all the colonies in the production of the raw material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s object was <num value="4">four</num>-fold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>She desired to continue to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> manufacturing power in the world; she desired to monopolise the carrying trade of both hemispheres; she desired to be, as she had been, mistress of the seas; and she desired to become independent of other nations for her supply of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>None of these objects could be effected by a peaceful separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>A war &mdash; a long and bloody war &mdash; a war as destructive of property as possible &mdash; a war so exhaustive of both parties, that at the end of it neither of them could give any disturbance to her in any project of ambition or interest which she might thereafter entertain &mdash; was what she most earnestly desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>She has her wish now; but should the war terminate at its present point, her object would be but half accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We are both (we and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>) powerful at this time &mdash; either of us able to beat <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> on land, and, therefore, to defeat any schemes she may entertain against any portion of this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Blood has flowed like water; but enough of it has not yet been shed to satisfy her sanguinary appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>She has already <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the carrying trade, but she wants it all. Her merchants, ship-owners and manufacturers are all making colossal fortunes, and would deplore the termination of the war as the greatest of all possible calamities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The cotton operatives are starving, but they are used to it, and nobody listens to them. &#x0022;Let the war go on. It is making us all rich,&#x0022; is the cry of all classes in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, except the operatives before mentioned. &#x0022;Let the war go on until this accursed negro slavery he overthrown and abolished forever.&#x0022; Such is the cry of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> in the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>And when <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> tells us that he deeply laments a war which is securing the naval ascendancy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, giving her the carrying trade of the world, and literally drowning her in a golden deluge, we simply do not believe <num value="1">one</num> word he says.
