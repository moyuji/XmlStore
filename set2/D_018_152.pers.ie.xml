<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> We have a great many statesmen who demand at once to know what the <rs>North</rs> proposes to do &mdash; what the government proposes to do &mdash; whether we propose to coerce our Southern brethren back into their allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They ask us, as of course they may rightfully ask, what will be the value of fraternity which is compelled!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>All I have to say on that subject is, that so long ago as the time of <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName></persName> More, he discovered, and set down the discovery in his writing, that there were a great many schoolmasters, and that while there were a very few who knew how to instruct children, there were a great many who knew how to whip them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>[Laughter] I propose to have no question on that subject, but to hear complaints, to redress them if they ought to be redressed, and if we have the power to redress them, and I expect them to be withdrawn if they are unreasonable, because I know that the necessities which made this Union exist for these States are stronger to-day than they were when the <rs>Union</rs> was made, and that those necessities are enduring, while the passions of men are short lived and ephemeral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I believe that secession was stronger on the night of <date value="11-06">the 6th of November </date> inst.--when a President and a <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice President</rs> who were unacceptable to the slave States were elected &mdash; than it is now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The sons of sires who endured such evils and such sufferings, as cannot be described, to give us this heritage which we enjoy, should, if they honor their memories, try in some degree to practice their virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Let us see whether they are practicing the virtues of those great and honored men. Let us be a little honest with each other to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In attempting to avoid their faults we have ceased to practice some of their virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They were austere men, were sometimes harsh men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is not for us here to say. But in my judgment they are not very trifling matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They are things which deserve some serious thought and consideration on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They are to be looked at in a serious light, and not to be trifled with We are mistaken when we suppose that our brethren at the <rs>South</rs> do not think that we are not influenced by principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They think their lives and their all are at stake.--However mistaken and misguided they may be, they are sincere about it. They think there is something in it for which they are to fight, to bleed, and, if need be, to die. Have we not some duties in regard to the matter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Is there not some fault on our part as well as on theirs?

<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">The <rs>Pekin Gazette</rs>.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/> --Few of our readers have a correct idea of the importance of the <rs>Pekin Imperial Gazette</rs>, the official organ of the <rs>Government</rs>, and will be surprised to hear that it is conducted on a greater scale than any paper in Christendom, not even excepting the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London Times</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The <rs>Gazette</rs>, which may be properly considered as the patriarch of periodicals, is a daily paper, got up in pamphlet form, of about <num value="60">sixty</num> or <num value="70">seventy</num> pages each number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>The price of subscription amounts to only <measure n="14dollars" type="currency">$14</measure> a year, or less that <measure n="4cents" type="currency">four cents</measure> a number, and might consequently defy any competition, even in these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the country of cheap publications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Nothing can be put in the columns of the <name>Gazette</name> without being previously and carefully read by a committee of political or literary men, according to the nature of the article. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/> The official portion of the paper is sent directly from the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of the <rs>Emperor</rs>, and is made up with a brief account of the principal events of the day, judiciary reports, a leader on the political situation, petitions and memoirs addressed to the <rs>Sovereign</rs>, together with his answers, his orders, his instructions to the mandarins, and whatever he chooses to give of his views on various questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Nothing is to be altered in those official articles even involuntarily, under the penalty of death!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Therefore, the unfortunate compositors and proof- readers of the <rs>Imperial</rs> paper live in a continual state of trepidation; for all know how easy it is for a type-setter, in a hurry, to mistake <num value="1">one</num> letter for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>The newspapers in the provinces are obliged to republish that official portion of the <name>Gazette</name> for which the public has the greatest reverence, and which is, by that way, a powerful instrument of government, centralization, and of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>It can be understood by that, how important it is for <name>Christian</name> diplomats, concluding treaties with the <rs>Chinese Government</rs>, to insist on having them published in the <rs>Imperial Gazette</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>It is the best sanction which they can receive, and, moreover, a kind of public consecration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/> The remainder of the paper is made up pretty much as our own newspapers, with various pieces of intelligence, items of all kinds, and literary articles; with this difference, however, that the greater number of columns is devoted to poetry, fables, odes and poems, particularly on the virtues, genius, and <num value="1001">one thousand and one</num> admirable qualities of the <rs>Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>The <rs>Gazette</rs> has also, as well as the <rs>French</rs> papers, a <hi rend="italics">feuilleton,</hi> or serial novel, generally written by the most popular pens of the age. With the exception of the ugly things said in those novels of the <rs>Western</rs> devils &mdash; i. e., the <hi rend="italics">Fou-lang-sai,</hi> (<persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00455" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>,) and <hi rend="italics">In-ki-li,</hi> (<persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00456" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>,) which are, of course, nonsensical falsehoods, the <name>Gazette</name> is written in a most creditable manner, and we may hope, <num value="1">one</num> day before long, to see that model of <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> newspapers exchanging with our own, and contributing a fair quota of extracts to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> periodicals.--<hi rend="italics"><orgName n="New Orleans Picayune" type="newspaper">N.
