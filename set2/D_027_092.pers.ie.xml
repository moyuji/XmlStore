<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>They would have taken all the navy and as much of the army as they could have induced to join them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Their resources would have been multiplied beyond measure, and their arrogance would have grown far beyond even their actual acquisition of wealth and power.
