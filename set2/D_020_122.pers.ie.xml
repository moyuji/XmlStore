<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The account given us of this unfortunate event is truly sad, while it furnishes an example of the inhuman spirit and reckless disregard for even innocent women and children which has characterized the <rs>Federal Government</rs> up to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We are told that about <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> priors to this event, <persName n="Dix,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Dix,John,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dix</surname></persName>, with about <num value="2000">two thousand</num> men, went over and demanded of our little force, which was only about <num value="1800">eighteen hundred</num> strong, and with little means of defence, an unconditional surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> There are some facts that ought to be brought to the attention of those in authority in connexion with this section of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It would seem that there is no apprehension of a further advance on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the direction of <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName> before spring exists at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; and yet there is, in my opinion, nothing more reasonable or probable than that such an advance should and will be made, especially if our forces be withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Who should we not expect an advance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The sky and the light shine through it, and every step you approach reveals the havoc of cannon ball and rifle bullet &mdash; prostrate fences, singed and blackened balls, and stems of trees broken short off, their branches lying near them, while scattered bones lie bleaching, and fragments of every kind even yet remain to point the places where the conflict was the deadliest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> A dull and dreary day it was, befitting the harrowing scenes that presented themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Many other places we visited, all so frequently described that our readers need no repetition of the scenes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> Several parties were inspecting these historic grounds even on this dreary autumnal day, and we were informed that not a day has passed since the battle but a score or more of persons have visited those battle grounds; and we think if any <num value="1">one</num> is inclined to enter on the speculation, that a comfort able tavern, with an inviting sitting room, and good cheer always ready, would be a very lucrative and welcome business on that road near the <rs type="place">Stone Bridge</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> Comfortable homes despoiled and deserted or half in ruins, affording a scanty protection to the teamsters who seem to spend their days in trudging to and fro between the camps and the nearest town and railroad depot; here and there pickets hovering near the heap of damp green logs that they vainly endeavor to kindle into a fire; a company on march, or a regiment just ordered off, with stray soldiers going and coming in little parties, and these are the passengers that greet you as you proceed mile after mile through that beautiful but desolate country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> Who that has once seen can ever forget the view that meets your eye on reaching the ridge of bills that overlook the valley around <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>This place has been chosen on account of its elevated and admirable position for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>It seems, indeed, a natural fortification, commanding a wide, stretching valley on all sides, especially westward, which on gaining the hill as you approach from the <rs type="place">Stone Bridge</rs>, lies spread before you dotted &mdash; nay, covered with camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>To the right and left, and on the slopes of the opposite hills, camps lie everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Among the woods between and beyond them, on the open glades, glistening in contrast to the glowing tents of autumn, beautiful in the distance, yet sad to contemplate, we behold the winter dwellings of tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our noble Southerners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>As we passed among them we could but observe a vast difference in the arrangement of these camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Some of them, standing back to back, with a broad road between each double row in front, all at right angles, with no rubbish or refuse, or any offensive sight or smell, wore a healthy and attractive appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Others, again, seemed <q>&#x0022;pitched&#x0022;</q> down without law or order, heaps of rubbish and untidiness choking up the thoroughfares, engendering sickness faster than the hospitals can turn out the convalescent patients. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> A variety of adventures befell the troops, and befell the tents, too, or beshrew them, during the gales of last week, for they were falling about in all directions <q>&#x0022;The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I knew,&#x0022;</q> said <num value="1">one</num> officer, <q>&#x0022;was the camp tumbling about my ears, I inside of it; there was I, all in a heap, and could neither find my way out nor get any <num value="1">one</num> to assist me, so I concluded to lie there till the rain was over.&#x0022;</q> Several others shared a similar fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The army does not appear to be in much danger of starving just yet. We were regaled with fresh beef, fried potatoes, delicious bread and biscuit, omelettes, good butter, and coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Who could desire a better supper or breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The soldiers seem quite happy in dispensing their hospitalities, and have the not unfrequent opportunity of entertaining ladies, for the soldiers' wives and sisters are always welcome, and seem to adapt themselves to camp life with great zest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> We were favored with an inspection of the batteries and breast works, the contemplation of which, with the living scenes around them, cast us into a train of reflections that would extend far beyond the limits of this newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/><num value="1">One</num> thought, however, we will impart to our readers which is that there is not much fear of our men <q>&#x0022;rusting with idleness;&#x0022; </q> and that not only the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> when they next favor us will have good reason to acknowledge the substantiality of these numerous fortifications, but that the future generations will visit these places of historic interest with pride and veneration for their ancestors whose works do honor to their hands and hearts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> To return from the sublime to the practical, we will venture in conclusion to make a suggestion which we hope may not be out of place, while at the same time we duly appreciate the courtesy and hospitality that rendered our visit to the camps in every way agreeable and gratifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>In these times of blockade, of enterprise, and self dependence, we would suggest that a contract should be made with the army butchers for all the hides, hoofs, horns and tallow we perceived, by <num value="2">two</num> distinct organs, to be lying in corners and ditches much too near to humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> Our rivers and railroads we find by experience to be great avenues of defence, and utterly valueless to the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>In breadstuffs and provisions of all kinds, except hog meat, the <rs>South</rs> could now be exporters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> The South having by the prowess of her sons established her superiority as a military power, can afford to make peace on the basis of free trade with all the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>It would be greatly to the interest of the nations having commercial relations with her to assume the war debt, now about <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars, thus removing every shackle on commerce and establishing a solute free trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Commercial freedom would secure basting peace, and insure the highest state of civilization to as generous and chivalric a people as the world possesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The nations having trade with us will be less taxed by assuming their proportion of our war indebtedness, than they would be by any tariff on imports that could be devised by us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>Within the extremely short space of <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure>, it has wound its form not only through the pores of Government and the great city, but its oppressive weight is being felt by the country people.

<head>The Loyalty of <placeName reg="Watanga county">Watanga county</placeName> Vindicates.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/> <hi rend="italics">Auditors Dispatch:</hi>--In a recent number of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> in a communication giving an account of the disturbances in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, the number of traitors assembled at their several camps, &#x0026;c., the writer remarks that <num value="500">five hundred</num> men were expected to join them from <placeName reg="Watanga county">Watanga county</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7007709" n="1.000 4" reg="north carolina">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>That statement conveys an imputation upon the patriotism of the people of that county, an unjust and contrary to the facts in the care, that I ask to be permitted to correct it through your columns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/> Watanga is a small county lying along the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, giving only about <num value="600">six hundred</num> votes, and although adjoining Last <placeName key="tgn,7007825" n="1.000 7" reg="tennessee">Tennessee</placeName>, has <num value="3">three</num> fail companies in our army &mdash; a company of cavalry under <persName n="Folk,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00483" reg="mostcommon:Folk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Folk</surname></persName>, and <num value="2">two</num> companies of infantry under <persName n="Horton,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00484" reg="mostcommon:Horton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Horton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Farthing,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00485" reg="mostcommon:Farthing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Farthing</surname></persName>; and I will venture to say that no portion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people are represented by a braver, hardier, or more patriotic hand of men. They are all marksmen, accustomed to take a fine sight upon their object, and death is sure to follow the report of their rifles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>A large portion of them have left their farms and young families in the care of the old folks, and gone to distant and sickly portions of the republic, determined to drive back the <rs>Northern</rs> vandals, or perish in the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>While lately at the house of <persName n="Green,,Amos,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00486" reg="default:Green,Amos,,,"><foreName>Amos</foreName> <surname>Green</surname></persName>, a citizen of Watanga, an honest and upright man, and a pure patriot, be told me that <num value="4">four</num> of his <num value="5">five</num> sons were in the army, and his wife joining in said, that if necessary the last <num value="1">one</num> should go, and the women would do the work them selves, though they had the families of a son and son-in-law to take care of, and needed his help very much, as the old man was so afflicted with rheumatism, as to be scarcely able to get about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>And such instances of self-sacrificing devotion to the cause are common in the county. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/> The imaginary line dividing Watanga from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> is a real fine of division in sentiment between her people and the traitors of that disaffected region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>And I am happy to be able to state, from personal knowledge, that they are as heartily united in the cause of the <rs>South</rs> as any people in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; and are determined to meet and drive back the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and their allies, come they from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> or from any other quarter. </p>
