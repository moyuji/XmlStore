<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The moral effect of the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 6" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName> has not been as great even as that of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <num value="2">two</num> together were no such disaster as the defeat of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>If that army had remained intact, we could have permitted the <rs>Federal</rs> forces to make as many flying trips through the <rs>South</rs> as suited their convenience, and establish their headquarters in <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 6" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName> or any other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> towns that they could fairly capture.--We do not despair of the efficient reorganization of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> and its ultimate recovery from the losses it has suffered; but its defeats have done more to produce the existing depression than the capture of a <num value="100">hundred</num> Savannahs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The only important loss in that place is the cotton, which ought to have been destroyed, even if it involved the destruction of that enterprising New England city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The Northern sentiment expressed at the late peace meeting in <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 6" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName> is only what might have been expected from the <rs>Northern</rs> men engaged in it. Whilst it is true that among the most loyal citizens and soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are men of Northern birth, it cannot be denied that those who have come to the <rs>South</rs> merely for purposes of trade and traffic are not infallible exponents and representatives of the real sentiments of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.--This is eminently true of <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 6" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It has long had more than its proportion of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> trading adventurers, who went there with the single idea of cotton, and who stamped the cotton idea upon the whole aspect of society in that town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We should have been surprised beyond measure if these New Englanders had not produced an Arnold, and had hesitated to endorse <persName n="Sherman,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But their opinions are not of as much value to us as their cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Nothing in the surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 6" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName> has surprised or mortified us, save the loss of that commodity. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Not a spark of resentment or spirit lights up its sluggish comments on that remarkable document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The British Lion is a designation which can hereafter be only ironically applied to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <rs>King</rs> of Beasts is not in the habit of being bearded in his den with impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The patient Ass would be a more appropriate emblem of a government which bears anything that can be put upon it, and greatly prefers provender to battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> There was a time when the sword of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would have leaped from its scabbard at the slightest of the provocations, now innumerable, which it has received from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But that day has past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Its chivalry has fallen into the sere and yellow leaf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Its people are as brave and manly as ever, but the spirit of trade and money-getting has deadened the sentiment of honor, and the canker of a long peace has eaten out the pith and vitality of military pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Ever since the downfall of the <name>Tory</name> party and the predominance in the national councils of the commercial interest, national chivalry has been dead in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The Tories, with all their faults and errors, were the true representatives of the <rs>British Lion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>That <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> king of beasts disappeared with them.--It is not possible that he is still in his old cage, when <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> can poke the longest kind of pole into it every day without eliciting a single roar. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The anti-slavery party in the <rs>North</rs> would have died out long ago but for the inspirations it received from a country to which all <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> were in the habit of looking for lessons in civilization and morals.--By books of travels, by novels, by songs, by sermons, by reviews, by newspaper articles, by Exeter Halls and political emissaries, by contributions of money, by diplomacy, by social and religious influences; in fine, by every instrumentality that could be brought to bear upon the human mind, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has been laboring for the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> to propel her whole moral weight upon the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, so as to instigate and inflame it to sectional hostility against those States of the <rs>Union</rs> in which slavery existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The most distinguished Southern statesman, on a visit to her capital, was ostentatiously slighted by the nobility, and a fugitive slave publicly petted by the same <rs>Duchess</rs> of <persName n="Sutherland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Sutherland,nomatch:0"><surname>Sutherland</surname></persName> who dispossessed her white tenantry in <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName> to convert their farms into sheep walks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The South never had a friend in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> till this war began!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Was all this philanthropy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Every child knows that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has been the greatest slave-trader in the world, and herself planted the institution here which suddenly became so abhorrent to her moral sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Even an idiot can understand that she only used anti-slavery as a wedge to accomplish the disruption of a hated and formidable power, and hence, now that her object is accomplished, she preserves a &#x0022;rigid neutrality,&#x0022; and takes sides with neither &#x0022;belligerent.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> But the day of retribution will <num value="1">one</num> day come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Her hold upon the magnificent province of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> is precarious, and her ancient domination of the seas may, ere long, be successfully disputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We have no doubt she sympathizes with &#x0022;the rebellion,&#x0022; and wishes that it would last forever; but it is only that her own prosperity may be built upon the common ruin of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>For a time the object of these remarkable exhibitions was not apparent to the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> army, and it was supposed to be a custom of the <rs>Celestial</rs> observed by them in all their battles &mdash; probably in the nature of an invocation to their deities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>After the battle, however, they captured the general orders of the mandarin chief, and found that the &#x0022;Children of the <rs>Sun</rs>&#x0022; were ordered to sound their abominable gongs and blow their trumpets when the &#x0022;barbarians&#x0022;approached, and were promised that the effect would be so terrifying to the <rs>English</rs> that they would all fall down from fear; and then the order stated that their &#x0027;breeches were so tight that they never could get up again, and might be easily captured.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The New York World,"></bibl></cit>
