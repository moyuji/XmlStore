<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> There are some additional facts and circumstances connected with the battle of the <rs>Chickamauga</rs> which deserve to be recorded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The battle field lies on the west bank of West Chickamauga, and is about <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Ringgold, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2024062">Ringgold, Ga.</placeName></placeName>, and about the same distance from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga, Tenn.</placeName>, being nearly due west from the former and nearly due south from the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is some <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> below the <placeName reg="Tennessee, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName></placeName> line, and is bounded on the west by the <rs type="place">Missionary Ridge</rs>, (a continuation of <placeName reg="Walden Ridge, Tennessee" key="tgn,2747976">Walden's Ridge</placeName> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>,) and on the east by the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, or &#x0022;river of blood,&#x0022; as the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> name implies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><placeName key="tgn,2024122" n="1.000 61" reg="rossville, walker, georgia">Rossville</placeName>, the former home of <persName n="Ross,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="default:Ross,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Ross</surname></persName>, the celebrated chief of the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokees</rs>, is <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> north from the battle field, and situated at the foot of a pass in <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It was in this lovely valley of the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, and along these mountain passes, that the hostile tribes were wont to meet in battle array and settle their disputes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It was here that the dusky maiden was wooed and won by her forest born lover, and questions of boundary and dominion and revenge found their bloody solution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>This was in the years that are gone when the untutored <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> held undisputed sway in these wild glens and coves and among these rocky fastnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>And yet how faithfully does the civilized white man of this day repeat the history of the savage red man of that!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The same passions animate his heart, the same policies engage his councils, and the same field now drinks up his blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The &#x0022;River of Blood&#x0022;--if this was an appropriate name for the crooked, gliding, serpent-shaped river in the days of the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>, recent events have given to it a yet stronger claim to that sanguinary title. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The ground upon which the battle was fought is slightly undulating, except where it approaches the mountain spurs and ridges on the west, and is covered with heavy timber, with occasional patches of cleared land here and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The timber is not so thick as that around <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, where the undergrowth is almost impenetrable, but resembles more the woods about <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, where the troops were man&#x0153;uvered with comparative ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The artillery could take but an inconsiderable part in the battle in consequence of the timber and the level character of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>On the left next to <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> the ground is broken into hills and valleys, but the primeval forest still remains, and consequently the most skillful artillerist could accomplish, but little. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> It is said that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Benjamin,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s plan of attack was designed to be the same as that of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, viz: a movement down the left bank of the <placeName reg="Chickamauga river">Chickamauga</placeName> by a column which was to take the enemy in flank, and drive him down the river to the next ford or crossing below, where a <orgName type="regiment" key="2Command">second column</orgName> was to cross over and unite with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in pushing the enemy still further down the river, until all the bridges and fords had been uncovered and our entire army passed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>But this is not all; indeed, it is the least part of the glorious result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>By a single battle we succeeded in expelling the invader from the soil of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, the teeming <rs>Egypt</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, at a time of much solicitude in the public mind, and under circumstances which seemed propitious to the successful advance of the enemy into the very heart and stronghold of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They had travelled from the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, in crowded cars, upon open platforms and upon the tops of the cars, in the rain, in the dust and in the sun, and with but little food or sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>They had passed by their own homes without stopping to embrace the loved ones there &mdash; homes which some of them had not seen since the commencement of the war; and had rushed to the scene of action without rest or transportation, halting only long enough to clear their eyes of the dust of travel and replenish their cartridge boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The officers were without horses, and the men without wagons to transport their supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>There was not time to furnish either; the battle was about to be joined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>His forces occupy a bend in the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, which is spanned by <num value="2">two</num> wide substantial pontoon bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>To attack the enemy in such a position were worse than madness.
