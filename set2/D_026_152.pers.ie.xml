<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday, for a wonder, passed away without even a startling rumor connected with military operations, and for once, at least, on a Sunday, the <hi rend="italics">quid <unclear></unclear> </hi> were at a loss for a subject upon which to base speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>This may be accounted for, perhaps, to the oppressive heat of the atmosphere, which produced an enervating effect upon mankind generally, and prevented those gatherings upon the street corners which we have been wont to witness heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><rs type="role">Gen.</rs> <unclear></unclear> dispatch informs us that everything was quiet around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and passengers by the train last evening state that the same condition of things prevailed yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Therefore the relative situation <unclear>of affairs</unclear> in that locality is unchanged.--Another to a report brought in by scouts, <unclear></unclear> has informed his men that the hard fighting is over, and that the siege of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> has commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>If this be really true, it may have been done by way of <unclear>en</unclear> his troops, whom he has heretofore thrown into battle with a recklessness that has produced amongst them a decided state of demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In any event, we have no apprehension as to the final result, whether he resorts to the sword or to the <unclear> </unclear> process of starvation to elect the reduction of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Now was <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s opportunity, and he accordingly took advantage of it, with what success the sequel will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>By a well executed flank movement, he succeeded in closing in upon the enemy, and at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> in the evening the attack was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The retreat was precipitate, amounting, indeed, to a rout, the dead and wounded of the enemy being left in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is stated that our men mounted the breastworks and charged with impetuosity in the very face of the foe, killing and wounding a great number, and putting them to flight.

<head>The iron-clads.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, with all the immense odds they possess in this war against us, could not rest without multiplying their iron clade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> says they have expended <num value="70000000">seventy millions</num> of dollars upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We conjecture that the <hi rend="italics">Herald </hi> is greatly under the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>That the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> should have incurred such immense expenditures for these formidable engines of war on the water, against the <rs>South</rs>--which commenced the struggle with no navy, hardly anything to build <num value="1">one</num> out of, and very few men who knew anything of the art of shipbuilding to use its limited material,--is a very striking illustration of the nature of the undertaking to subjugate the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>With all the world open to the <rs>North</rs>; with the old regular <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName> and navy, while we had neither army nor navy to begin with; with the arms of foreigners added to its <num value="12000000">twelve million</num> more of population than we have; with the enlistment of the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves to fight against their masters;--with all these odds it has had ever since the war began, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men building iron-clads to do the work on the water of crushing the rebellion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>And yet the rebellion is not crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We are driven from our rivers, and the great armies of the enemy, when defeated by our gallant soldiers, retreat to the protection of the gunboats which keep up the police of those rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>These are odds against us; they are advantages for the enemy of a character that no invading force ever had in any war that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>And yet the <rs>South</rs> maintains the spirit and force of its resistance with increasing ardor and efficiency. --It will so continue to maintain its rights until they are finally triumphantly established, in spite of all the unprecedented advantages which the enemy wields in his ruthless war for our subjugation and ultimate annihilation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> Now let us suppose, for a moment, that we had commenced this war with the advantage of a navy &mdash; with ships on the sea, and with some iron clads and <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName> to protect our rivers and harbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>This war would have terminated ere this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Virginia they could not have invaded at all, except in and near the mountains, and there they could neither march, man&#x0153;uver, nor support an army of any consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>They could have marched a larger army by the <name>Piedmont</name> route than any other; and that army once whipped it could not have been saved from destruction; for the entire reserves of the <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">Virginia army</orgName> could have been hurled upon it, and have destroyed it, since they would not have been needed to protect the tidewater and its cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>A Northern army that could by possibility have penetrated as far as <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> or <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and have provisioned itself near this city, when once whipped must have been annihilated; for it would have no gunboats to shelter it from our brave defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>What earthly chance would <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> stand now but for his gunboats?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>He could never have taken up his present position, and would have retreated long ago with precipitancy back to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, after he was really whipped at the <rs>Rapidan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Thus our noble rivers, which would have been our invincible defenders were they armed with Confederate iron clads, have become our betrayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>They give the enemy all that strength without which the invasion would have been dead, and its spirit fled to the <name>Hades</name> of all inhumanities and malignities long since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> While we deplore this condition of the struggle, and regret the necessity which it imposes upon us of submitting to a prolongation of the war, we are only inspired to greater exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Our brave <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> will vindicate our cause and establish our independence, notwithstanding the odds they cope with, while the conduct of our adversary in this war will damn his nation to everlasting infamy, and give to history a chapter more disgraceful to humanity than any yet upon record. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>He is, he can be, actuated by no motive higher than the basest malignity.--And yet this person, whose conduct richly merits the gallows, has the assurance to prate about humanity, and the laws of war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It is well for him that &#x0022;the laws of war&#x0022;cannot take effect in his case; for if they could, he would swing to a certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>He threatens to retaliate by placing Confederate prisoners in his works, under the fire of our batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>We have no occasion to fire on his works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>All we want is to stop his dastardly war upon our women and children by making his comrades participate in the danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>In this policy we hope our Government will persevere, not only at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, but everywhere else, wherever a defenseless town, the destruction of which can have no effect upon the issue of military operations, may be subjected to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fire.
