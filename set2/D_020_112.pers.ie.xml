<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>This branch of political economy has, for <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> past, engaged much of my time and reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I have elsewhere elaborated the subject, designing to publish it in pamphlet form, but have been prevented by the present difficulties in having it done at this time.--Circumstances may develop, making it imperative on the <rs>Government</rs> to issue a paper medium of exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>That case is with us now; but the <rs>Government</rs> should guard every point, indeed, use the extremest caution, in such an act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> We will assume that our Government is too wise to issue any more than is absolutely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Next to the folly of issuing a redundance, is the danger of counterfeiting.--The <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName>, aware of this risk, does not permit a note to pass out of the <name>Bank</name> the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time; it is carefully preserved in a wire-netting, and at stated periods they are destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In former times they were burned, and to be doubly sure, in latter years they grind them up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> If a Government has sources of wealth; in short, if the people who live under it are wealthy, and the commerce of that Government be interrupted, so that the usual amount of specie is not received by it; at the same time, if there be a strong probability of a restoration of commercial prosperity, it is the positive duty of that Government to create a substitute for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Our Government may issue any amount it may require, simply guarding against counterfeiting as the <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName> does, with every assurance of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>There are few men in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who would not credit such an issue, especially if the note presented an honest face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Confidence would be enhanced by a conditional promise of redemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>For instance, at a stipulated time after the blockade was raised, they might promise to redeem a portion, or the whole, as the case might be; and further, they might promise that if the resources of the <rs>Government</rs> from imports, duties, &#x0026;c., should not be adequate, direct taxation would be resorted to, unless the people, through their representatives in Congress, should postpone it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> These notes would not resemble the ordinary bank issues in the least, secured as they would be by the wealth of the whole Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The bank note is only worth <measure n="33cents" type="currency">thirty-three cents</measure> in the dollar, and has no other value or importance, until the bank gets the note of the individual property holder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is the man who borrows the money from the bank who gives it its credit, and causes it circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Even then the bank promises to do an impossibility, and states an untruth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Hence the money panics and distress which at various periods have afflicted the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The issue of paper as a substitute for money by the <rs>Government</rs>, in an emergency like the present, every thinking man knows is absolutely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He knows, further, that such an issue by a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Government is nothing more nor less than a promissory note of the people, given as is done every day in individual transactions in anticipation of a crop, or of some individual enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>All, then, that the people want, is to know that it is a temporary thing, and that it will not exist any longer than the necessity demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We are not in fact anticipating our crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>That risk is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The crops are actually made and ready to be exchanged, and all know that after we have exchanged for as many goods as we want, there will be a large balance coming to us, which will be paid with <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>If this error could be discarded, much of the mist which has, in all ages, enveloped this branch of political economy would be dissipated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> In every instance in the world, where Government has undertaken to make money out of a valueless thing, (resting exclusively on its authority,) it has failed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> Money must have a value in common with everything else derived from labor </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> Under the law of adaptation &mdash; and nature does not reveal any law more distinctly than that &mdash; gold and sliver were designed for money; they are found in the world in quantities, making their production compensate the producer about at the same rate labor is compensated in the production of all other values. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> Ages before it was ever coined, it was used as money with the scales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It cannot be counterfeited, because the school boy may apply tests which will decide whether <name n="God" type="God">God</name> or man made it. It is the very essence of value, and not the representative of it. Neither is it the measure of value, as some writers say; but it is a medium of exchange for the whole world whereby man is enabled to denominate and pay prices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> The limits of a newspaper article forbids the discussion of this subject as I would like. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> But let me ask those who hold to the doctrine of <persName n="Lamartine,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Lamartine,nomatch:0"><surname>Lamartine</surname></persName>, if the fact which he asserts, (viz, that in revolutionary times gold and sliver disappear,) is not positive proof of their genuineness, and on the other hand, did not the failure of the <rs>Government</rs>, with all its promises and threats to accomplish its design, prove its inability to do so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Government may create a substitute temporarily for money; but the idea of making an established medium of exchange, resting exclusively upon its own powers, is to defy nature and Nature's <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>We are confident that you will be victorious in the end; and even if in small skirmishes where the numbers are unequal, you sometimes suffer a repulse, our faith wavers not, and we as confidently expect to hear of another race from <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName> towards <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as we did from <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> to that place. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The manner in which the <rs>Fanny</rs> was captured, and the scampering of the <rs>Indiana</rs> regiment from Chickomicomico before our troops, all go to show us that the coast is not unprotected, and it fills our hearts with joy and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> bosoms with awe to know it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/> A few days ago, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers contained a silly report that New Orleans had been captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>They denied the report themselves, after publishing it for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>We therefore have little hope that anything suggested by the news papers of this city will have any weight with the authorities; but there is a very decided sentiment in the community that the prison management heeds overhauling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/> We have reason to know that our previous publications on the greed of avarice have met with the approval of the intelligent masses of the people, while certain ill-natured communications from interested persons show that the goad has touched a tender part though it may not thus far have produced any visible effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Much has been written and said upon the salt question, the universal sentiment of the people being decidedly averse to paying an exorbitant and unreason able price for that indispensable article, and an instance was recently communicated to us by a correspondent wherein prompt measures were resorted to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>The price of the article has varied in that place, but generally on an ascending scale; though the later quotations were some <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> lower per sack than in the city market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>The act of the <rs>President</rs> may be regarded by some persons as high-handed, but it was endorsed by the almost unanimous sentiment of the <name>Clarksville</name> community.
