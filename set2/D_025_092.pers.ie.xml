<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>A letter from Headquarters of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of Potomac</orgName>, dated the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num>, says: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> For some days past it has been evident that this army would not long remain in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, and every <num value="1">one</num> who knew anything of our own and the rebel forces understood that it would be impossible for us to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Hence the only question for <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> to solve was how to get his immense trains and stores away in safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Consequently a strong force of cavalry, under <persName n="Buford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Buford,nomatch:0"><surname>Buford</surname></persName>, appeared at daylight on Saturday at <placeName reg="Germania ford">Germania ford</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> below <placeName key="tgn,2113825" n="1.000 35" reg="raccoon ford, culpeper, virginia">Raccoon Ford</placeName></placeName>, while infantry and cavalry appeared in force at the fords in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Cedar Mountain, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2229381">Cedar Mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I learn that he was instructed not to bring on a general engagement, as the plan was to lure the rebels back to their right and centre by the demonstrations in those quarters &mdash; a plan which would be thwarted by bringing on a general engagement upon our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Consequently, after <measure n="0.5hours" type="date">a half hours</measure> skirmishing, he fell back in the direction of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> and took position near <orgName n="Bethel Church" type="church">Bethel Church</orgName>, where a support of infantry was posted, and to which place they were followed by the rebels. --Here a part of our cavalry dismounted and deployed as infantry, and for a short time the fight was brisk indeed; but, the rebel force proving too strong, or, abiding by his orders, <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> fell back still further toward the main body of the corps, posted <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> <offset>west</offset> of  <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In this movement a part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="120NYVolunteer">One Hundred and Twentieth New York Volunteers</orgName> was captured; but they did not long remain prisoners; for, watching their opportunity, a brigade of cavalry, of which the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY5">Fifth New York</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="MI5">Fifth Michigan</orgName> were a part, dashed upon the guard having the captives in charge, and rescued all but some <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> an order came for us to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In about half an hour that vast mass of troops was in motion, without the least noise or confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Nothing could give you a stronger illustration of the power of discipline than the silence and order which prevail throughout a camp of several <num value="1000">thousand</num> men, even on a midnight march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Every man, horse and wagon is in its place, and moves as if by the single power of mechanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is an imposing sight to see these large masses moving along in the dark of the night like gliding spectres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Not a voice, not a whisper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The very sound of their tread is hushed.--Then the abandoned camp fires glow and crackle among the might forest trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The red glow mounts to the horizon, and the dark trees cast their giant shadows around in the most fantastic shapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Add to these the lamps suspended to light our way, and you have, indeed, a solemn midnight scene. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> As we neared the river another interesting fight presented itself to our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The troops marched on in <num value="2">two</num> long interminable columns, with their guns and bayonets glistening in the clear bright morning sun.--Further on the right came long lines of artillery, cavalry, wagons, and ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><num value="1">One</num> should see a great army on the march to form a correct notion of its colossal extent, of the unbounded resources required to keep such a consuming leviathan in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Each corps requires nearly <num value="1000">one thousand</num> wagons and ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>These, with their <num value="6">six</num> horses or mules each and their drivers, make a little army in themselves.--Add to this the immense supplies required for the cavalry and artillery, and a sum total is swelled up that might bankrupt a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> rate power. </p>
