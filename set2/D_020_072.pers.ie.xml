<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It is stated as a significant fact, that while there are <num value="1000">thousands</num> in the camp, here and in other parts of the <rs>State</rs>, drilling for battle, cheerfully suffering the privations attending a preparation for active warfare, far away from home and its endearments, standing guard by day and by night, in storm and calm, in rain and sunshine, there are some who are rapidly increasing the dimensions of their <q>&#x0022;pile&#x0022;</q> by speculations, and in some cases by extortion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I do dot prefer this charge, and hope it could not be sustained; but the charge is made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Such, indeed, is said to be the case in some of the <rs>Southern</rs> cities.--We are not only to be conquered and subjugated, say the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--scattered like leaves before the angry wind &mdash; sent back to our homes to find poverty at our firesides and see privations in the anxious eyes of mothers and the rags of children; but we are to be starved &mdash; starved to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><q>&#x0022;In this respect, however,&#x0022;</q> says a Southern writer, <q>&#x0022;the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have a bad prospect ahead.&#x0022;</q> But if such a thing could possibly happen in this great Southern land of plenty and untold abundance, those Southern men who assay thus to increase their wealth by taking advantage of opportunities presented by the war for profitable speculation, would greatly assist our sworn enemies in their efforts to starve us out.-- <q>&#x0022;Prices of provisions,&#x0022;</q> says the writer alluded to, &#x0022; are high now, and they will be kept up by a disorganized market and the practices of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We would again reiterate our caution to planters to spare no exertion in making meat and cereal crops, so as to reduce prices which are now forced up by speculators, by the disorganization of the accustomed course of trade, and by the impression that the heavy demand for staple supplies for the army will keep up prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But let not the false impression be for a moment entertained that there can be a deficiency of bread and meat in the <rs>South</rs>--no matter if the war should continue for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The census of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> shows that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> produced jointly <num value="13363000">13,363,000</num> bushels of wheat, or <num value="241000">241,000</num> more than the great wheat <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>, or a quantity equal to the whole product of the <num value="6">six</num> <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, with <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs>, and <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, all put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><orgName type="college" n="Carolina college">Carolina</orgName>, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> produced <num value="115471593">115,471,593</num> bushels of corn, a quantity exceeding by <num value="300000">300,000</num> bushels the joint product of New York, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Connectiout, New Hampshire, <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> And let it be remembered that there never was so much grain planted in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and other Southern States, as there has been and will be this year, and the yield has been perfectly enormous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I say, then, to all here and elsewhere, dismiss your fears about any probability of a real scarcity of provisions in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The young men are fighting the battles of the country, while the staunch old farmers and planters, with their slaves, are making plentiful supplies of bread and meat to feed them &mdash; enough for man and beast, and some to spare for rascally <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>And the thrifty wives and daughters &mdash; the crowning glory of the <rs>South</rs>--these are spinning, knitting, weaving, and sewing, to clothe the fighting men comfortably, and protect them from the cold and the storms in winter time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The foregoing will probably be considered a digression &mdash; running off at a tangent; but, as there is no fighting to announce, the ideas are caught flying and put down in a tangible form for the consideration and disposal of those who are fully competent to judge of the quality and quantity of intellectual food for the digestion of the insatiate public mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The charming weather calls out <num value="1000">thousands</num> to breathe the invigorating air, and the streets are crowded with people of all classes and conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> --It is clear that the <q>&#x0022;forward movement&#x0022;</q> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></hi> from the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2118671" n="1.000 14" reg="huntersville, pocahontas, west virginia">Huntersville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Monterey, Highland, Virginia" key="tgn,2113061">Monterey</placeName> has been blocked by the judicious fortifications of the enemy, and by the superior numbers of his strongly posted forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It is plain that some other line of march must be adopted, or else the enemy must be expected to make his winter quarters in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>It is certain that, if prompt and effective measures be not taken for penetrating that country by some line of march leading to the rear of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Reynolds,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,nomatch:0"><surname>Reynolds</surname></persName>,</hi> we must expect <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to remain under the jurisdiction of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Pierpont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Pierpont,nomatch:0"><surname>Pierpont</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Carlile,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Carlile,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlile</surname></persName>,</hi> for a season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Every day's delay to reconquer <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> adds to the strength of the enemy, by converting true men among its population over to the side of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>To allow the enemy to winter in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> is to allow him to fortify himself in its strongholds so securely as to endanger the permanent loss of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> With a view to permanent separation, it would never do to allow the <rs>Northern Confederacy</rs> to own the <rs>Western</rs> slope of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>To concede that slope to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for the practice of their negro-stealing habits, would be equivalent to abolishing slavery in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The ridge of the <rs>Alleghany</rs> chain of mountains might be a natural line of boundary for the <num value="2">two</num> Confederacies, but it would be anything else than a line of defence for the <rs>Southern States</rs>.--<placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> was never secure from the invasions of the <name>Gauls</name> and the <name>Goths</name> until her <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> had carried the war beyond the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> and planted the eagles of the <rs>Empire</rs> upon the <rs>Rhine</rs> and the <rs>Danube</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/><placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> was not secure until she held the <rs>Rhine</rs> and <rs>Danube</rs>.--A mountain frontier is a nursery of assault and invasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> With a view to the ultimate possession of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, the present campaign in that quarter possesses immense interest to the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It is as important a portion of the <rs>South</rs> as <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>We shall be able to hold <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> with difficulty, if the enemy should hold <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>; just as we should be able to hold <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> with difficulty without <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>In view of the promising operations just now going on in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, the campaign in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> becomes doubly important, and is doubtless enlisting the especial attention of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> It would seem from the late advices reaching us from that direction, that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>,</hi> failing in his forward movement upon <placeName reg="Cheat Mountain, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,2234058">Cheat mountain</placeName>, was turning his attention to the operations in <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002264">Greenbrier county</placeName>, and that, with an escort of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> men, he had gone over to the camp of <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, beyond <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName> at <placeName reg="Meadow Bluff, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119162">Meadow Bluff</placeName>, to look after operations in that field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>He is to be followed by several <num value="1000">thousand</num> of his troops from <placeName key="tgn,2118671" n="1.000 14" reg="huntersville, pocahontas, west virginia">Huntersville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The Government has also dispatched all the regiments available at <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> to the reinforcement of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>;</hi> insomuch, that if a fight does not come off with <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Rosencranz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Rosencranz,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosencranz</surname></persName></hi> in the meantime, we shall have on that line of operations, by the end of this week, nearly <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> men, counting the sick and the well, exclusive of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s</hi> army from <placeName key="tgn,2118671" n="1.000 14" reg="huntersville, pocahontas, west virginia">Huntersville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> These circumstances show very plainly that the <rs>Government</rs> has resolved upon a new programme for <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, which contemplates a forward movement, with a strong force, from the direction of <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName> upon <placeName reg="Clarksburg, Harrison, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117793">Clarksburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Parkersburg, Wood, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119512">Parkersburg</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> Provided a competent force be put at the command of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> on that line, much may be expected from this new programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>We should expect much quicker work from it, however, and much more certain success, if the column numbered <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men, instead of <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>; and we shall receive advices of further reinforcements being forwarded with much satisfaction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> The only fear to be apprehended for the success of operations beyond <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName>, is from the too great circumspection of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.</hi> In mountain warfare the learning of the books and of the strategists is of little use. In a country where it is impossible to find enough level land to muster a company of militia, there is very little scope for ingeniously studied military evolutions or consummately arranged plans of campaign on paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It is impossible for the books to embrace the <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000">thousand</num> topographical features of a wild region, where all Nature seems drunk and the hills and mountains in high frolic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The only rule of warfare in such a region is to throw away all rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The policy there is to fight and march, to march and fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Mathematics is fit only for wadding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Ingenious ink and paper plans of campaign are about as useless in the region about the Big Sewell as a <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McCormick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,nomatch:0"><surname>McCormick</surname></persName>'s</hi> reaper in a mountain wheat <q>&#x0022;field.&#x0022;</q> Technical generalship in a mountain campaign is as much out of place as the <rs>Great Eastern</rs> steamer would be on the <placeName reg="Mount Nebo, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119310">Gauley river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The great requisites of an army fit for mountain warfare are good legs and a plenty of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The best General for such an army is he who will keep them most actively on the march and most constantly loading and firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Physical exertion is the great thing in mountain warfare; the refined strategy of science can have no play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>While <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></hi> was weaving ingenious webs of strategy about <placeName reg="Cheat Mountain, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,2234058">Cheat Mountain</placeName>, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Rosencranz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Rosencranz,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosencranz</surname></persName></hi> was legging it down to the <rs>Gauley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Legs and powder and ball do much better in the mountains than even the science of a <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Vauban,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Vauban,nomatch:0"><surname>Vauban</surname></persName></hi> or a <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>.</hi> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The farmers and farmers' sons of the <rs>North</rs>, and all men of productive industry, will be reluctant to leave the vocations by which they live, and come here to be made food for powder.

<head type="nobreak" rend="italics">Small notes.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> --These have been the subject of much remark of late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>We regard them as an evil at some times and under some circumstances, but as of benefit to the public just now. In ordinary times, when the various banks redeem their issues in specie, they are a nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Now, when no bank pays out <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>; when bank notes are a mere nominal representative of coin; when Confederate notes, having not even a nominal place of redemption, and based only upon the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>, are received by everybody as money; when coin is worth <num value="0.15">fifteen per cent</num>, more than the best of bank notes, it is impossible to make people give <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> in exchange for notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Unquestionably there is specie enough in the community to answer the purposes of change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>But the difficulty is that <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> in coin are equal to <measure n="11.5dollars" type="currency">eleven and a half dollars</measure> in paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>If, then, a customer purchases <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar's</measure> worth of goods, and the merchant gives him <num value="4">four</num> specie dollars in change, the latter receives only <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure> for a dollar's worth of goods, and of course loses money by the operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>No merchant is foolish enough to make such trades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>How, then, are small purchases to be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The practical sense of the business men, which is often superior to the theories of political economists, has suggested and employed a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Business men know that all money is but the representative of values.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Coin and notes are of equal value when the latter are redeemable in the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>But these are not thus redeemable at this time; and so, some other representative of values, which is of equal, and only equal worth &mdash; dollar for dollar &mdash; with bank notes of large denominations must be used; and naturally notes of small denominations are brought into requisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>If bank notes were convertible at will into specie, these shinplasters would be an intolerable evil; but as such is not the case, they are merely a necessary <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>There is no remedy for this evil under present circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Perhaps it would be possible to do without small notes if people would allow those who give change to add the premium on the coin to the debt to be paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>But will the public consent to this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We answer, not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Hence, we infer that small notes are absolutely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>They indicate a disease in the body politic, but they are not the disease itself; they are only the plaster which hides the sore, and to remove them would merely expose the offensive spot without at all aiding to heal it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> So much for the shinplasters themselves.--But all this is no reason why irresponsible individuals, or firms, or corporations, should be allowed to issue them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>This city is evidently in good credit; its notes are good and useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>So of our banks, including savings banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>So also of some firms who have put out shinplasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>These, then, are justifiable in accommodating the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>But let the community take care that it be not defrauded by other parties of less character and responsibility, and before it is too late let our citizens hold a public meeting and agree to take certain sorts of shinplasters and to refuse to receive all others. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> Were <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> at this moment to announce to the world its intention to make the speediest possible conquest of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, or were <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to make the same declaration as to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the world would laugh at the egregious folly that had inspired the design and prompted the boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>The world would grant that, supposing either people to be infatuated enough, and obstinate enough, it could inflict enormous and irreparable injuries on the other, but only at the cost of equal injuries to itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The ball once started, Fortune might befriend this side or that; it might give to either great victories or periods of advantage; it might even place <num value="1">one</num> eventually over the head of the other; but still only at a cost utterly out of proportion to the value of the miserable result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Now, that is the case of the <num value="2">two</num> Confederacies across the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, where the surviving half of <hi rend="italics">an effete <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName></hi> has undertaken to reduce the other half to its Federal duties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> We say that this is the case; but before we proceed a step further, it is necessary to observe that the case of the <rs>Northern</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> is in some important respects more difficult than ours would be. They are not so united as we have always found ourselves in war. Their border States feel a divided allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>They have to protect more than a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> of land frontier, including <num value="1">one</num> closely beleagured position surrounded by foes or ill-affected adherents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Speaking the same language as their foe, they have no means of excluding spies from their lines, or even traitors from their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>They have to make a standing army and a fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>They have to learn the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> elements of tacties, and even military discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>They are without soldiers, or officers to command and to train them.Their revenue, at its best, before the war, was only just sufficient to meet the interest of the debt likely to be incurred by <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war on its present scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>That revenue, however, is, to begin with, maimed by the loss of the seceders and by the stoppage of traffic, so that it is questionable whether it will be possible to do more than repair that loss by the new taxes now imposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> credit is not so good as British, nor is the credit of a <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> in process of dissolution likely to be equal to that of a united people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Lastly, war, which changes its character according to circumstances, establishes special rules of probability for different localities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The <num value="1">one</num> rule established by all <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> warfare is that the advantage is on the side of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Our offensive operations always failed against fortified positions; against breastworks thrown up in a night; against forests full of an invisible foe; against heat, hunger, and thirst; against the ever imminent flank attack; against the certainty that every step diminished the number, the strength, and the munitions of our men, and increased those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The present war might, for its incidents, be a chapter in our own disastrous wars on that soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>The Northerners have advanced upon a fortified position, but a day's march from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>They have arrived at the point with a force already melting away, far short of the list on paper, beaten with heat, hunger, thirst, and a long march, and surprised on both flanks by the sudden outpourings of railways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>While this has occurred in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, almost within sight of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, a column of <num value="8000">8,000</num> Federalists, advancing against a foe thrice their number, has met the same fate, no doubt for much the same reasons, at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500miles" type="distance">five hundred miles</measure> to the west &mdash; as if in order to warn the <rs>Northern States</rs> that what has happened is no accident, no result of peculiar circumstances or personal failure, but by inevitable rule. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> enterprise which can be compared to this and that is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s gigantic, but infatuated, attempt upon <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>That was a case of a great political alliance,as grand as a <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, comprising the best, the weslthiest, and the most populous part, and the best soldiers on the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, advancing into a territory, the sparse and poor population of which scarcely surpassed that of the invading best Winter might be the immediats <unclear></unclear> but it was also the <unclear></unclear> of the tremendous rout that <unclear></unclear> If <unclear></unclear> <num value="1">one</num> will attempt to compare the <unclear></unclear> of the <name>Federalists</name> with those <unclear></unclear> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Louis,,,:1"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, he will find them far inferior in every respect; while there is no doubt that the <rs>Southern States</rs> are far more able to defend every point, every position, every line in their territory, than the <name>Russians</name> were in theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>They have mountainous ranges instead of steppes; they have a population accustomed to carry arms, and only too glad to use them; they have railways, and abundance of food and other necessaries of war. They are evidently superior in generalship, and in the social organization best adapted for war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>The result is, that thus far they have shown they can dispute every inch, and keep the invader always under the apprehension of being either out ilanked or driven back upon his own capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Against all this it can only be said that the <rs>Northern States</rs> have the preponderance in white men, in money and in credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>These, indeed, would be important considerations if the <rs>Southern States</rs> were invading the <rs>Northern</rs>, and seriously preparing to drive every armed Northerner into the <rs>St. Lawrence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>They would be important if this were the ordinary case of <num value="2">two</num> countries at war with <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>But it is not. The Northerners are engaged in the reduction of the <name>Southerners</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>They are acting on the offensive against a foe which, on its own land, is content to act on the defer sive, excepting only that, should the opportunity occur, it would advance its line of defence to include the capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Experience shows that under ordinary circumstances a compurative small population, with little money and means of war, is sufficient for a very good defence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/> We are in a condition to offer advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>We can advise the <rs>Northern States</rs> of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, as we can advise the legitimate princes and the despotie courts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>What they purpose to do and be, is not only to be as good as the <name>Southerners</name>, or a little the better; but overwhelmingly superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Are they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Can they drive the <name>Southerners</name> like a flock of sheep, smoke them out of their own nests like wasps, ferret them like rabbits, and bag them like game?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Let them just look forward a little, and consider the probable state of things next year, and the year after, and <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> hence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>If a clear foresight shows, and must show, that there must be <num value="2">two</num> Federations, and that on no other footing will peace ever be made, it will be much better that it should come to pass after <num value="1">one</num> year's war than after <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>It is not as if the <rs>Union</rs> or <num value="2">two</num> Unions were the only alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>As the war proceeds, no man can tell what new powers and combinations may arise, and particularly how far the <rs>Western States</rs> will endure the taxes and financial obligations necessary for the war.
