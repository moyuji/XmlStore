<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> I most cordially thank his Honor, <persName n="Wilson,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,George,A.,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, and the citizens of <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg</placeName> generally, for their flattering reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>I am the more grateful because I know that it is not given to me alone, but to the cause I represent, which clearly proves to me their good will, and that sincere feeling is at the bottom of it. (Enthusiastic applause.) And here I may remark, that in every short address I have made to the people, in every crowd through which I have passed of late, some allusion has been made to the present distracted condition of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It is natural to expect that I should say something on this subject; but to touch upon it at all would involve an elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances, requiring more time than I can at present command, and would, perhaps, unnecessarily commit me upon matters which have not yet fully developed themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>(Immense cheering, and cries of <q>&#x0022;Good,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;That's right.&#x0022;</q>) The condition of the country is an extraordinary <num value="1">one</num>, and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It is my intention to give this subject all the consideration I possibly can before specially defining in regard to it--(cheers)--so that when I do speak it may be as nearly right as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>(Loud and continued applause.) When I do speak, I hope I may say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, contrary to the integrity of the <rs>Union</rs>, or which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people, or to the peace of the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>(Vociferous applause.) And furthermore, when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to disappoint the people generally, throughout the country, especially if the expectation has been based upon anything which I may have heretofore said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>(Applause.) Notwithstanding the troubles across the river, (the speaker pointing southwardly across the <rs>Monongahela</rs>, and smiling,) there is no crisis but an artificial <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>(Applause.) What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Take even their own views of the questions involved, and there is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>(A voice, <q>&#x0022;That's so.&#x0022;</q>) I repeat, then, there is no crisis excepting such a <num value="1">one</num> as may be gotten up at any time by turbulent men, aided by designing politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>My advice to them under such circumstances is to keep cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>If the great <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people only keep their temper, both sides of the line, the troubles will come to an end, and the question which now distracts the country be settled just as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this Government have been adjusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Let the people on both sides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away, in due time, so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>[Loud applause.] But, fellow- citizens, I have spoken longer on this subject than I intended in the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>[Cries of <q> &#x0022;Go on.&#x0022;</q>] I shall say no more at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Fellow-citizens, as this is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity I have had to address a Pennsylvania assemblage, it seems a fitting time to indulge in a few remarks upon the important question of the tariff &mdash; a subject of great magnitude and <num value="1">one</num> attended with many difficulties, owing to the great variety of interests involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>So long as direct taxation for the support of the <rs>Government</rs> is not resorted to a tariff is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>A tariff is to the government what meat is to the family; but this admitted, it still becomes necessary to modify and change its operations according to new interests and new circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>So far there is little difference of opinion among politicians; but the question as to how far imposts may be adjusted for the protection of home industry gives rise to numerous views and objections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>I must confess I do not understand the subject in all its multiform bearings, but I promise you I will give it my closest attention and endeavor to comprehend it fully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>And here I may remark that the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform contains a plank upon this subject which I think should be regarded as law for the incoming administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>[Immense demonstrations of applause.] In fact, this question, as well as all other subjects embodied in that platform, should not be varied from what we gave the people to understand would be our policy when we obtained their votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>[Continued applause.] </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> The Tariff bill, now before Congress, may not pass at the present session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>I confess I do not understand the precise provisions of this bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>I do not know whether it can be passed by the present Congress or not. It may or may not become the law of the land, but if it does, that will be an end of the matter until modifications can be effected, should it be deemed necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>If it does not pass &mdash; and the latest advices I have are to the effect that it is still pending &mdash; the next Congress will have to give it their earliest attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>According to my political education, I am inclined to believe that the people in the various portions of the country should have their own views carried out through their representatives in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/><hi rend="italics">The consideration of the <name>Tariff</name> bill should be postponed until the next session of the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">National Legislature</orgName>.</hi> No subject should engage your representatives more closely than that of the tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>If I have any recommendation to make, it will be that every man who is called upon to serve the people in a representative capacity, should study the whole subject thoroughly, as I intend to do myself &mdash; looking to all the varied interests of the common country &mdash; so that when the time for action arrives, adequate protection shall be extended to the coal and iron of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, the corn of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and the reapers of <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Permit me to express the hope that this important subject may receive such consideration at the hands of your representatives that the interests of no part of the country may be overlooked, but that all sections may share in the common benefits of a just and equitable tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>(Applause.) But I am trespassing upon your patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>(Cries of <q>&#x0022;No!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>no! go on.&#x0022;</q>) Well, listeners, I must bring my remarks to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Thanking you, most cordially, for the kind reception you have extended me, I bid you all adieu.

The large numbers that have turned out under these circumstances, testify that you are in earnest about something or other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But do I think so meanly of you as to suppose that earnestness is about me personally!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>I would be doing you injustice to suppose you did.--You have assembled to testify your respect to the <rs>Union</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the <name>Laws</name>, and here let me say, that it is with you, the people, to advance the great cause of the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and not with any <num value="1">one</num> man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>This fact is strongly impressed on my mind at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>In a community like this, whose appearance testifies to their intelligence, I am convinced that the cause of liberty and the <rs>Union</rs> can never be in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Frequent allusion is made to the excitement at present existing in our national politics, and it is as well that I should also allude to it here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>I think that there is no occasion for any excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>As I said before, this crisis is all artificial ! It has no foundation in facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It was not argued up, as the saying is, and cannot, therefore, be argued down.

<head>Horror: a true tale.<lb/>[Continued.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/> The room, a large and lofty <num value="1">one</num>, with an arched roof, had somewhat of a sombre character from being wainscoted and ceiled with polished black oak of a great age. There were mirrors, and there were pictures on the walls and handsome furniture, and marble chimney-pieces, and a gay Tourney carpet; but these merely appeared as bright spots on the dark background of the <name>Elizabethan</name> wood-work.--Many lights were burning, but the blackness of the walls and roof seemed absolutely to swallow up their rays, like the mouth of a cavern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>A <num value="100">hundred</num> candles could not have given that apartment the cheerful lightness of a modern drawing-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>But the gloomy richness of the panels matched well with the ruddy gleam from the enormous wood fire, in which, crackling, and glowing, now lay the mighty <persName n="Yule,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00520" reg="mostcommon:Yule,nomatch:0"><surname>Yule</surname></persName> log. Quite a blood-red lustre poured forth from the fire, and quivered on the walls and the groined roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>We had gathered round the vast antique hearth in a wide circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>The quivering light of the fire and candles fell upon us all, but not equally, for some were in the shadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>I remember still how tall and manly and handsome <persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName> looked that night, taller by the head than any there, and full of high spirits and gaiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>I, too, was in the highest spirits; never had my bosom felt lighter, and I believe it was my mirth which gradually gained the rest, for I recollect what a blithe, joyous company we seemed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>All save <num value="1">one</num>. <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00521" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName>, dressed in grey silk and wearing a quaint <rs n="head dress" type="product">head-dress</rs>, sat in her arm-chair, facing the fire, very silent, with her hands and her sharp chin propped on a sort of ivory-handled crutch that she walked with, (for she was lame,) peering at me with half shut eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>She was a little spare old woman, with very keen, delicate features of the <rs>French</rs> type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>Her grey silk dress, her spotless lace, old-fashioned jewels, and prim neatness of array, were well suited to the intelligence of her face, with its thin lips, and eyes of a piercing black, undimmed by age. Those eyes made me uncomfortable, in spite of my gaiety, as they followed my every movement with curious scrutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>Still I was very merry and gay; my sisters even wondered at my ever-ready mirth, which was almost wild in its excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>I have heard since then of the <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scottish</rs> belief that those doomed to some great calamity become <hi rend="italics">fey,</hi> and are never so disposed for merriment and laughter as just before the blow falls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>If ever mortal was <hi rend="italics">fey,</hi> then I was on that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>Still, though I strove to shake it off, the pertinacious observation of old <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00522" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName>'s eyes did make an impression on me of a vaguely disagreeable nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Others, too, noticed her scrutiny of me, but set it down as a mere eccentricity of a person always reputed whimsical, to say the least of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/> However, this disagreeable sensation lasted but a few moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>After a short pause my aunt took her part in the conversation, and we found ourselves listening to a weird legend which the old lady told exceedingly well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/><num value="1">One</num> tale led to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> was called on in turn to contribute to the public entertainment, and story after story, always relating to demonology and witchcraft, succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>It was <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00523" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>, the season for such tales; and the old room, with its dusty walls and pictures, and vaulted roof, drinking up the light so greedily, seemed just fitted to give effect to such legendary lore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>The huge logs crackled and burnt with glowing warmth; the blood-red glare of the <name>Yule</name> log flashed on the faces of the listeners and narrator, on the portraits, and the holly wreathed about their frames, and the upright old dame in her antiquated dress and trinkets, like <num value="1">one</num> of the originals of the pictures stepped from the canvas to join our circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>It threw a shimmering lustre of an ominously ruddy hue upon the oaken panels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>No wonder that the ghost and goblin stories had a new zest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>No wonder that the blood of the more timid grew chill and curdled, that their flesh crept, and their hearts beat irregularly, and the girls peeped fearfully over their shoulders, and huddled close together like frightened sheep, and half fancied they beheld some impish and malignant face gibbering at them from the darkling corners of the old room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>By degrees my high spirits died out, and I felt the childish tremors, long latent, long forgotten coming over me. I followed each story with painful interest; I did not ask myself if I believed the dismal tales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>I listened, and fear grew upon me &mdash; the blind, irrational fear of our nursery days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>I am sure most of the other ladies present, young or middle-aged, were affected by the circumstances under which these traditions were heard, no less than by the wild and fantastic character of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>But with them the impression would die out next morning, when the bright sun should shine on the frosted boughs, and the rime on the grass, and the scarlet berries and green spikelets of the holly; and with me &mdash; but, ah ! what was to happen ere another day-dawn?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>Before we had made an end of this talk, my father and the other squires came, in, and we ceased our ghost stories, ashamed to speak of such matters before these new comers &mdash; hard-headed, unima- ginative men, who had no sympathy with idle legends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>There was now a stir and bustle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/> Servants were handing round tea and coffee, and other refreshments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Then there was a little music and singing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>I sang a duet with <persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName>, who had a fine voice and good musical skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>I remember that my singing was much praised, and indeed I was surprised at the power and pathos of my own voice, doubtless due to my excited nerves and mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Then I heard some <num value="1">one</num> say to another that I was by far the cleverest of the <rs>Squire</rs>'s daughters, as well as the prettiest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>It did not make me vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>I had no rivalry with <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> and Ninnie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>But <persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName> whispered some soft fond words in my ear, a little before he mounted his horse to set off homewards, which <hi rend="italics">did</hi> make me happy and proud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>And to think that the next time we met -- but I forgave him long ago. Poor <persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>And now shawls and cloaks were in request, and carriages rolled up to the porch, and the guests gradually departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>At last no <num value="1">one</num> was left but those visitors staying in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Then my father, who had been called out to speak with the bailiff of the estate, came back with a look of annoyance on, his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/><cit> <q rend="inline">&#x0022;A strange story I have just been told,&#x0022; said he; &#x0022;here has been my bailiff to inform me of the loss of <num value="4">four</num> of the choicest ewes out of that little flock of <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName> downs I set such store by, and which arrived in the north but <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> since.-- And the poor creatures have been destroyed in so strange a manner, for their carcasses are horribly mangled.&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl></cit> Most of us uttered some expression of pity or surprise, and some suggested that a vicious dog was probably the culprit.<cit><q rend="inline"> &#x0022;It would seem so,&#x0022; said my father;&#x0022;it certainly seems the work of a dog; and yet all the men, agree that no dog of such habits exists near us, where, indeed, dogs are scarce, excepting the shepherds' collies and the sporting dogs secured in yards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Yet the sheep are gnawed and bitten, for they show the marks of teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Something has done this, and has torn their bodies wolfishly; but apparently it has been only to suck the blood, for little or no flesh is gone.&#x0022; &#x0022;How strange I&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl></cit> cried several voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Then some of the gentlemen remembered to have heard of cases when dogs addicted to sheep- killing had destroyed whole flocks, as if in sheer wantonness, scarcely deigning to taste a morsel of each slain weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>My father shook his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/><cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;I have heard of such cases, too,&#x0022; he said; &#x0022;but in this instance I am tempted to think the malice of some unknown enemy has been at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>The teeth of a dog have been busy, no doubt, but the poor sheep have been mutilated in a fantastic manner, as strange as horrible; their hearts, in especial, have been torn out, and left at some paces off, half-gnawed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>Also, the men persist that they found the print of a naked human foot in the soft mud of the ditch;and near it &mdash; this.&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl></cit> And he hold up what seemed a broken link of a rusted iron chain.-- Many were the ejaculations of wonder and alarm, and many and shrewd <sic>the the</sic> conjectures, but none seemed exactly to suit the bearings of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>And when my father went on to say that <num value="2">two</num> lambs of the same valuable breed had perished in the same singular manner <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> previously, and that they also were found mangled and gore-stained, the amazement reached a higher pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Old <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00524" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName> listened with calm, intelligent attention, but joined in none of our exclamations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/><cit><q rend="inline">At length she said to my father, &#x0022;Try and recollect &mdash; have you no enemy among your neighbors?&#x0022;</q> <bibl></bibl></cit> My father started, and knit his brows. &#x0022;Not <num value="1">one</num> that I know of,&#x0022; he replied; and indeed he was a popular man and a kind landlord. &#x0022;The more lucky you, &#x0022; said the old dame, with <num value="1">one</num> of her grim smiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>It was now late, and we retired to rest before long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/><num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the guests dropped off. I was the member of the family selected to escort old <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00525" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName> to her room &mdash; the room I had vacated in her favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>I did not much like the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>I felt a remarkable repugnance to my <name n="God" type="God">god</name>-mother, but my worthy aunts insisted so much that I should ingratiate myself with <num value="1">one</num> who had so much to leave, that I could not but comply.-- The visitor hobbled up the broad oaken stairs actively enough, propped on my arm and her ivory crutch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The room never had looked more genial and pretty, with its brisk fire, modern furniture, and the gay <name>French</name> paper on the walls. &#x0022;A nice room, my dear, and I ought to be much obliged to you for it, since my maid tells me it is yours,&#x0022; said her lady- ship; &#x0022;but I am pretty sure you repent your generosity to me, after all those ghost stories, and tremble to think of a strange bed and chamber, eh?&#x0022; I made some common-place reply, The old lady arched her eyebrows.-- &#x0022;Where have they put you, child?&#x0022; she asked; &#x0022;in some cockloft of the turrets, eh?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>or in a lumber-room &mdash; a regular ghost-trap?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>I can hear your heart beating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>with fear this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>You are not fit to be alone.&#x0022; I tried to call up my pride, and laugh off the accusation against my courage, all the more, perhaps, because I felt its truth. &#x0022;Do you want anything more that I can do for you, <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00526" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName>?&#x0022; I asked, trying to feign a yawn of sleepiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>The old dame's keen eyes were upon me. <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;I rather like you, my dear,&#x0022; she said, &#x0022;and I liked your mamma well enough before she treated me so shamefully about the christening dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Now, I know you are frightened and fearful, and if an owl should but flap your window to-night, it might drive you into fits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/><milestone unit="column" n="2"/> There is a nice little sofa-bed in this dressing-closet &mdash; call your maid to arrange it for you, and nobody will be a bit the wiser, or quiz you for being afraid.&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl> </cit> How little I knew what hung in the balance of my refusal or acceptance of that trivial proffer!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Had the veil of the future been lifted for <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">one instant</day></dateStruct>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>but that veil is impenetrable to our gaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>Yet, perhaps, <hi rend="italics">she</hi> had a glimpse of the dim vista beyond, <hi rend="italics">she</hi> who made the offer; for when I declined, with an affected laugh, she said, in a thoughtful, half abstracted manner, &#x0022;Well, well ! we must all take our own way through life Good night, child &mdash; pleasant dreams!&#x0022; And I softly closed the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>As I did so, she looked round at me rapidly, with a glance I have never forgotten, half malicious, half sad, as if she had divined the yawning gulf that was to devour my young hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>It may have been mere eccentricity, the odd phantasy of a crooked mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>the whimsical conduct of a cynical person, triumphant in the power of a frightening youth and beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>Or, I have since thought, it <hi rend="italics">may</hi> have been that this singular guest possessed some such gift as the <name>Highland</name> &#x0022;<num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> sight,&#x0022; a gift vague, sad, and useless to the possessor, but still sufficient to convey a dim sense of coming evil, and boding doom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>And yet, had she really known <hi rend="italics">what</hi> was in store for me, <hi rend="italics">what</hi> lurked behind the veil of the future, not even that arid heart could have remained impassive to the cry of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>She would, she <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have snatched me back, even from the edge of the black pit of misery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>But, doubtless, she had not the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>Doubtless she had but a shadowy presentiment, at any rate, of some harm to happen, and could not see, save darkly, into the viewless void where the wisest stumble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>I left her door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>As I crossed the landing a bright gleam came from another room, whose door was left ajar; it (the light)fell like a bar of golden sheen across my path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>As I approached the door opened, and my <persName><roleName n="Sister">sister</roleName> <foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName>, who had been watching for me, came out. She was already in a white cashmere wrapper, over which her loosened hair hung darkly and heavily, like tangles of silk. </p>
