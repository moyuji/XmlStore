<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The message of the <rs>President</rs>, in another column, will be read with more profound interest than any document ever issued by a public officer in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is not necessary to enumerate the several points which it makes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He does not disguise the danger with which he conceives the country and the capital to be surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He states the only means by which, in his opinion, it can be met and averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If his recommendations be not attended to, he throws the responsibility on Congress, which has now been in session since <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> without having provided by legislation for the essential points alluded to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Whatever Congress may intend to do in the premises, we trust they will do at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This is no time for deliberation, when the enemy are actually thundering at the gates of the capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The moments lost in speech-making may prove of the last importance, for weal or woe, to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Prompt action is what is now required &mdash; prompt action, and nothing more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Congress will feel that its legislation, thus far, has not been sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The country already feels this, and we think it is hardly necessary to appeal to the patriotism of Congress to supply what is wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We feel assured that there is enough of that sentiment among members to render them superior to all other considerations, at this trying moment, except the good of their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Above all other things, however, we unite with the <rs>President</rs> in his appeal for unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Let us not now, in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> year of this desperate struggle, exhibit the spectacle of those <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> States on the continent who, while everything on earth they held dear was at stake, could not, in the very presence of the enemy, restrain their senseless quarrels long enough to prevent him from taking advantage of them to their common destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It requires all our united strength to ward off the danger; and if the least particle of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> be wanting, we are lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It would be to the country the most welcome of all intelligence that harmony existed between all parts of the <rs>Government</rs>, State and Confederate, and that all were uniting for the benefit of all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It is vain for us to look back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We cannot go back if we would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>A fiery gulf lies between us and the <rs>Union</rs> which we left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>A remorseless enemy offers us no terms but abject and absolute submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Unless upon the precedent condition of submission to all he may require, he will not even condescend to hear a single word we have to say. We are reduced to the condition of having no choice between slavery in the vilest and most aggravating form &mdash; slavery implying the right on the part of the master not only to prescribe the terms on which we shall live, but even to abridge the term of life itself at option, and independence and freedom, purchased at many risks, and by mighty labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Submission will not do. The enemy spurns the offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There is nothing left for us but to fight it out. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This &#x0022;colored gentleman&#x0022; is supposed to be the new <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> counsellor, who tried in vain his politeness upon a group of Abolition <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, and, meeting with no success, advanced cordially to <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, who turned his back upon him and commenced talking with <num value="1">one</num> of his white constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Sam Slick, relating a similar interview between a &#x0022;colored gentleman&#x0022; <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> and a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Abolitionist, says: <q>&#x0022;If there was anything the <name>Abolitionist</name> hated like poison, it was a great bull &mdash; nigger; so seein' him come in, in that free and easy manner, he looks up at him quite stiff; and it made me laugh, for I knew humility was the <unclear> destroyer</unclear> of pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Now don't, for goodness <unclear>sake</unclear>, make such everlastin' pretences unless your practice keeps up to your professions.&#x0022;</q> We commend the homely counsel to <orgName><persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The election for members of the <name>Legislature</name> is close at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The crisis is the most important <num value="1">one</num> in which the country was ever placed &mdash; the necessity of having the right men in the right place &mdash; more imperative than it ever was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is not that any great amount of additional legislation is required.--The present Legislature has done nearly all that could be done in that respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is but fair to the larger body of them to say that they have been fully up to the times, especially during the last session. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> What we would particularly impress upon the people is, that men are required both for Congress and the <name>Legislature</name> who have the firmest and most abiding confidence in the success of our cause, and who have in their vocabulary no such word as &#x0022;fail.&#x0022; They must not only think success absolutely certain, but they must say so on all occasions when it may be necessary to express an opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>This is no time to look out for amiable tempers and mild manners in a delegate.

When that request was made, the most important measures that had occupied your attention during the session had not been so far advanced as to be submitted for executive action, and the state of the country had been so materially affected by the events of the last <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> as to evince the necessity of further and more energetic legislation than was contemplated in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> <orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> is now environed with perils which it is our duty calmly to contemplate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Thus alone can the measures necessary to avert threatened calamities be wisely devised and efficiently enforced. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Progress of the war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> Recent military operations of the enemy have been successful in the capture of some of our seaports, in interrupting some of our lines of communication, and in devastating large districts of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>These events have had the natural effect of encouraging our foes and dispiriting many of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The capital of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is now threatened, and is in greater danger than it has heretofore been during the war.--The fact is stated without reserve or concealment as due to the people whose servants we are, and in whose courage and constancy entire trust is reposed; as due to you, in whose <sic>wisdow</sic> and resolute spirit the people have confided for the adoption of the measures required to guard them from threatened perils. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> While stating to you that our country is in danger, I desire also to state my deliberate conviction that it is within our power to avert the calamities which menace us, and to secure the triumph of the sacred cause for which so much sacrifice has been made, so much suffering endured, so many precious lives been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>This result is to be obtained by fortitude, by courage, by constancy in enduring the sacrifices still needed; in a word, by the prompt and resolute devotion of the whole resources of men and money in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to the achievement of our liberties and independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The measures now required, to be successful, should be prompt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Long deliberation and protracted debate over important measures are not only natural, but laudable in representative assemblies under ordinary circumstances; but in moments of danger, when action becomes urgent, the delay thus caused is itself a new source of peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Thus it has unfortunately happened that some of the measures passed by you in pursuance of the recommendations contained in my message of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last have been so retarded as to lose much of their value, or have, for the same reason, been abandoned after being matured, because no longer applicable to our altered condition; and others have not been brought under examination.--In making these remarks, it is far from my intention to attribute the loss of time to any other causes than those inherent in deliberative assemblies, but only urgently to recommend prompt action upon the measures now submitted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> We need, for carrying on the war successfully, <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> men and <unclear></unclear> the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>We have both with <unclear></unclear> sufficient to attain <unclear></unclear>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> To obtain the <unclear></unclear> necessary to protect productive districts, guard our lines of communication by an increase in the number of our forces; and hence it results, that with a large augmentation in the number of men <unclear></unclear> army, the facility of supplying the troops would be greater than without recent reduced strength. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Supplies &mdash; payment for them in coin.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> For the purchase of supplies now required, especially for the armies in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, the treasury must be provided with means; and a modification in the impressment law is required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It has been ascertained, by examination, <unclear></unclear> have within our reach a sufficient <unclear></unclear> what is most needed for the army <unclear></unclear> without having recourse to the ample provision existing in those parts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> with which our communication has been partially interrupted by hostile operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>But in some districts from which supplies are to be drawn the inhabitants, being either within the enemy's lines or in very close proximity, are unable to make use of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate treasury notes</orgName> for the purchase of articles of prime necessity; and it is necessary that, to some extent, coin be paid, in order to obtain supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It is, therefore, recommended that Congress devise the means for making available the coin within the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for the purpose of supplying the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The officers of the supply departments report that, with <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of dollars in coin, the armies in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> can be amply supplied for the remainder of the year; and the knowledge of this fact should suffice to insure the adoption of the measures necessary to obtain this moderate sum. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Impressments.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> The impressment law, as it now exists, prohibits the public officers from impressing supplies without making payment of the valuation at the time of impressment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The limit fixed for the issue of treasury notes has been nearly reached, and the treasury cannot always furnish the funds necessary for prompt payment while the law for raising revenue which would have afforded means for diminishing, if not removing, this difficulty, was, unfortunately, delayed for several months, and has just been signed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>In this condition of things, it is impossible to supply the army, although ample stores may exist in the country, whenever the owners refuse to give credit to the public officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It is necessary that this restriction on the power of impressment be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The power is admitted to be objectionable, liable to abuse, and unequal in its operation on individuals; yet, all these objections must yield to absolute necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It is also suggested that the system of <sic>valuaation</sic> now established ought to be radically changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The legislation requires, in such cases of impressment, that the market price be paid; but there is really no market price in many cases, and then valuation is made arbitrarily and in a depreciated currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The result is, that the most extravagant prices are fixed, such as no <num value="1">one</num> expects ever to be paid in coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>None believe that the <rs>Government</rs> can ever redeem in coin the obligation to pay <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> a bushel for corn, or <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">seven hundred dollars</measure> a barrel for flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It would seem to be more just and appropriate to estimate the supplies impressed at their value in coin; to give the obligation of the <rs>Government</rs> for the payment of the price in coin, with reasonable interest, or, at the option of the creditor, to return in kind the wheat or corn impressed, with a reasonable interest, also payable in kind; and to make the obligations thus issued receivable for all payments due in coin to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Whatever be the value attached by Congress to these suggestions, it is hoped that there will be no hesitation in so changing the law as to render it possible to supply the army in case of necessity for the impressment of provisions for that purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The measure adopted to raise revenue, though liberal in its provisions, being clearly inadequate to meet the arrear of debt and the current expenditures, some degree of embarrassment in the management of the finances must continue to be felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is to be regretted, I think, that the recommendation of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, of a tax on agricultural income equal to the augmented tax on other incomes, payable in treasury notes, was rejected by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>This tax would have contributed materially to facilitate the purchase of provisions and diminish the necessity that is now felt for a supply of coin. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head>The exemption bill.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The measures passed by Congress during the session for recruiting the army and supplying the additional force needed for the public defence have been, in my judgment, insufficient, and I am impelled by a profound conviction of duty, and stimulated by a sense of the perils which surround our country, to urge upon you additional legislation on this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The bill for employing negroes as soldiers has not yet reached me, though the printed journals of your proceedings inform me of its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Much benefit is anticipated from this measure, though far less than would have resulted from its adoption at an earlier date, so as to afford time for their organization and instruction during the winter months. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The bill for diminishing the number of exempts has just been made the subject of a special message, and its provisions are such as would add no strength to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The recommendation to abolish all class exemptions has not met your favor, although still deemed by me a valuable and important measure; and the number of men exempted by a new <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> clause in the act just passed is believed to be quite equal to that of those whose exemption is revoked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>A law of a few lines repealing all class exemptions would not only strengthen the forces in the field, but be still more beneficial by abating the natural discontent and jealousy created in the army by the existence of classes privileged by law to remain in places of safety while their fellow-citizens are exposed in the trenches and the field. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="5"> 
<head>The militia.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The measure most needed, however, at the present time, for affording an effective increase to our military strength, is a general militia law, such as the <rs>Constitution</rs> authorizes Congress to pass by granting to it power &#x0022;to provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>,&#x0022; and the further power &#x0022;to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.&#x0022; The necessity for the exercise of this power can never exist if not in the circumstances which now surround us. The security of the <name>States</name> against any encroachment by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> is amply provided by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, by &#x0022;reserving to the <name>States</name>, respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> A law is needed to prescribe not only how, and of what persons, the militia are to be organized, but to provide the mode of calling them out. If instances be required to show the necessity of such general law, it is sufficient to mention that, in <num value="1">one</num> case, I have been informed by the <rs>Governor</rs> of a State that the law does not permit him to call the militia from <num value="1">one</num> county for service in another, so that a single brigade of the enemy could traverse the <rs>State</rs>, and devastate each county in turn, without any power on the part of the <rs>Executive</rs> to use the militia for effective defence; while in another State the <rs>Executive</rs> refused to allow the militia &#x0022;to be employed in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>,&#x0022; in the absence of a law for that purpose. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="6"> 
<head>Suspension of the <name>Habeas</name> corpus.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> I have heretofore, in a confidential message to the two Houses, stated the facts which induced me to consider it necessary that the privilege of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus </hi> should be suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The conviction of the necessity of this measure has become deeper as the events of the struggle have been developed.--Congress has not concurred with me in opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is my duty to say that the time has arrived when the suspension of the writ is not simply advisable and expedient, but almost indispensable to the successful conduct of the war. On Congress must rest the responsibility of declining to exercise a power conferred by the <rs>Constitution</rs> as a means of public safety, to be used in periods of national peril resulting from foreign invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>If our present circumstances are not such as were contemplated when this power was conferred, I confess myself at a loss to imagine any contingency in which this clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> will not remain a dead letter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> With the prompt adoption of the measures above recommended, and the united and hearty co- operation of Congress and the people in the execution of the laws and the defence of the country, we may enter upon the present campaign with cheerful confidence in the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>And who can doubt the continued existence of that spirit and fortitude in the people, and of that constancy under reverses which alone are needed to render our triumph secure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>What other resource remains available but the undying, unconquerable resolve to be free?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It has become certain, beyond all doubt or question, that we must continue this struggle to a successful issue, or must make abject and unconditional submission to such terms as it shall please the conqueror to impose on us after our surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If a possible doubt could exist after the conference between our commissioners and <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, as recently reported to you, it would be dispelled by a recent occurrence, of which it is proper that you should be informed. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It will further be remembered, that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> declared that the only terms on which hostilities could cease were those stated in his message of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> last, in which we were informed that, in the event of our penitent submission, he would temper justice with mercy, and that the question whether we would be governed as dependent territories, or permitted to have a representation in their Congress, was <num value="1">one</num> on which he could promise nothing, but which would be decided by their Congress after our submission had been accepted. </p>
