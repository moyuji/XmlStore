<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Making another occasional visit to this city to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I found affairs not very materially changed from what they were a week ago.--The same if not an increased activity in military movements was apparent; but obedient to Government requirement I refrain from giving particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Long trains of army wagons were in constant motion, ladened with supplies, provisions, munitions, etc. It seems impossible to escape for a moment their rumbling noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The day being pleasant, an unusually large number of persons appear upon the street and in public thoroughfares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Hotels and private boarding houses are said to be crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Each train of cars brings in a large number of passengers, many of whom are soldiers either returning from visits to their friends or coming up to join the army.--An unusually busy scene is presented in the vicinity of the depot, whilst business throughout the city appears quite active. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> So far as movements on the opposite side of the river are concerned, none save officials know, and very few of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Whatever may be said, therefore, in reference to the probable course that will be pursued, is mere conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Many are of opinion that a decisive conflict is not many days distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>These surmises grow out of general indications such as are supposed to succeed great pending events.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> I again ascended the dome of the <rs>Capital</rs>, and had a fine view of the encampments across the river, which have materially augmented during the past week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>An imposing and beautiful view, well worth a journey from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, is to be had from this elevated position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>No flag, however, was discernable, leaving the impression that it must have been taken down and planted elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Within a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, or <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> of this hill, I saw distinctly a number of Federal encampments, fortifications, and flags, beyond the furthest of which, ascended out of a thick woods, rising the dense columns of dark blue smoke, caused from the burning of brush and underwood. </p> </q><bibl n="A correspondent of a Northern journal"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> --<hi rend="italics">An Interesting Lecture.</hi>--A lecture on gun-shot wounds was delivered in the <orgName n="New York Medical College" type="college">New York Medical College</orgName> on Tuesday by <persName n="Raphael,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Raphael,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Raphael</surname></persName>: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> In the course of the lecture the professor remarked that there were more men killed and wounded, in proportion to the numbers engaged in battles at the present time, than in olden times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The fact was exemplified in the <name>Crimean</name> and <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> wars, and in our present troubles; and it was owing to the improved projectiles and weapons used now, particularly the <rs>Minnie</rs> and <rs>Enfield</rs> rifles and bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Wounds produced by bullets were of the kind called lacerated and contused, and were greatly modified by the seat of the injury and the state of health of the person wounded.--There were also what are called indirect wounds, made by spent balls, produced by splinters, or by the <hi rend="italics">ricochet</hi> of the old fashioned round cannon ball, throwing up stones or earth which gave almost as serious injuries as would a ball of the same size as the stone thrown up. The latter was altogether avoided in the rifled projectiles which did not <hi rend="italics">ricochet.</hi> Instances had been known where men had been killed by the mere passage of the ball, which was generally called &#x0022;windage.&#x0022; Instances of this kind were, however, extremely rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There were cases on record where serious wounds had been received by a soldier attempting to stop a spent cannon ball rolling very slowly, with his foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The ball rebounded and shattered his leg. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> A wound resembling a bullet wound might be produced by a discharge of small shot from an ordinary shot-gun, when fired close to the person, the small shot not separating, but entering the wound <hi rend="italics">en masse.</hi> Wounds were aggravated by the entrance of extraneous substances, such as pieces of clothing, coins, etc. Surgeons should be careful in examining the clothing around the wound after extracting the bullet; which should in all cases be done, except when the injury caused by the extraction of the ball would be greater than were it allowed to remain in the wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A great difference existed between the round and conical projectile in the disposition of the ball when in the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The round ball on entering a wound would be deflected from its course should it strike a bone, and instances were common where the ball had made a complete circuit, even where it has come out of the same wound it made on entering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The conical ball, however, passed directly through whatever part of the body it happened to strike, shattering everything in its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Another peculiarity of the conical ball was, that when it struck a bone it split it downwards, and very rarely affected the part above the wound. </p> </q><bibl n="Prof. Raphael"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> He continues thus: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> &#x0022;From information carefully collected in different provinces, the result appears to be: That for anything like a parallel to the present harvest, &#x0027;it would be necessary to revert at least to the year <date value="1846">1846!</date>&#x0027; whilst the majority of farmers declare this year to be considerably the worst of the <num value="2">two</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>That not only is the yield of the present year inferior as to quantity, but deplorably bad as to quality, the ear being small, light, withered, and dry. That the hard winter having done its work, many agriculturists sought a refuge by sowing in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, but she unnatural heats of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> burn up all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The barley (which in certain localities means beer) is in the same state as wheat, and that oats, which promised the best of the <num value="3">three</num>, have also been parched up just as they were about to be reaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Candidates for public patriots are as plenty as blackberries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>As a general thing the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> has not destroyed the patriotic readiness of menial both countries to serve the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Of all employers, the <name>Public</name> is the most fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It never has to advertise its desires in the column of <q>&#x0022;Wanted.&#x0022;</q> All the time, its doors are surrounded by crowds of patriots, who, whenever office is to be had, <q>&#x0022;spring up like mushrooms.&#x0022;</q> This is by no means astonishing.--The Public has not only a full exchequer, but in the most creditious, improvident, not to say extravagant, creator in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>It is moreover, blind as a bat, and deaf as <unclear></unclear> so that it is by the merest accident that it over happens to obtain the right man in the right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>In no other service has brazen pretension any chance to thrust aside modest merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>At the bar, in journalism, in the army and the navy, humbuge are soon detected and exploded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>But the <name>Public</name>, bless his honest sent, cause fill every room of his official mansion with rats and mice, who devour all the bread and cheese in his house, and never know that they are not efficient and exemplary guardians of his interests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> We have seen with interest a good many names which have been permitted to be mentioned in connection with the service of the public in the <rs>Congressional Department</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It is more particularly with reference to this that we desire to make a few comments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>We hope to see this new Government start on a path of true Republican simplicity, fidelity, and straightforwardness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>If over there was a time when the great <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName></hi> that should be applied to those who seek office in every department--<q>&#x0022;Is he capable, is he faithful, is he honest ?&#x0022;</q>--it <hi rend="italics">is now.</hi> The old Republic began &mdash; as most Republics begin &mdash; with good intentions and exemplary conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>There were not only political giants in those days, but most of them were men of genuine patriotism, who were more solicitous for the success and glory of the <rs>Republic</rs> than for the advancement of their own personal fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>,</hi> who would not receive a dime of pay over his expenses, for the most arduous, incessant, trying, and successful services that were ever rendered by man to the cause of human freedom, was a type of the <name>Revolutionary</name> men. They did not dream of improving their personal fortunes by the general distress, or fattening themselves at the public crib, whilst the great body of the people was enduring hardships and privation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The old Republic started right, but it was soon debauched; its political morality became as lax and its public men as bad, as they could be.--From <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> to--<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>;</hi> we need say no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It will avail our fortunes but little, if, having escaped this leprous association, we continue to retain its principles and practices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>If we do not make a good beginning, what shall be our end? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> If our youth is corrupt and tainted, what will be our manhood?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>In its <rs type="role2">President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice President</rs> the new Republic has placed the right men in the right place; in the principal leaders of its armies, it has been equally successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>If the people are true to themselves, they will apply the same test of fitness in their selection of officers in every department of the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>They will turn their backs on political backs and demagogues, and call upon the wisest, calmest, and most practical men &mdash; upon men of sober judgments of stability of character, of ripe experience in public affair, to represent them in the great assembly of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Who would not rejoice to see the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Senate and <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of the new Republic bearing some resemblance in its weight of metal, dignity of character, and courtesy of manner to the <orgName n="Great Britain Parliament" type="parliament">Parliament of Great Britain</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Such an exhibition would of itself go far to command the confidence of the whole world in the strength and permanency of the new Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Whereas, a Congress made up of such material as the old <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>, of <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> or <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>-rate men, who, by demagogism and humbuggery had attained places which they could not adorn either by the qualifications of the statesman or the manners of the gentleman, would go far to demonstrate at the out set that republicanism is a sham, and the capacity of the best population in the world for self government an empty delusion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>But while party spirit, involved in the very essence of our <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> institutions, is as incident to the elective franchise as is the agitation of the air to the elements that compose it, there are bounds beyond which, instead of promoting the blessings of constitutional liberty, it begins to pervert and destroy them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Those bounds are the delicate and dangerous lines of distinction between principle and prejudice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/> Under the old Government the cankerworm of corruption ate out the very vitals of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, amid the din of party strife and the clamor of demagogues disputing over the public plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Under the new Government let us strive to avoid all such suicidal excesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Let us endeavor to exemplify freedom, free from the elements of their own decay.--Let us, at the outset at least, be all united in the council chamber as we are in the field, in a common effort for the common cause of our common country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Let us have no parties until we have some legitimate basis for an opposition of principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The disruption of the <rs>Union</rs> obliterated all party issues among the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and brought us all together in defence of the liberties bought by the blood, and transmitted to us by the wisdom, of the great and good men of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> era of independence is at hand, and it behooves us as patriots, worthy to illustrate the sublime struggle in which we are engaged, to forget and forgive all our old political differences and party feuds &mdash; with clasped hands of brotherly love to congratulate each other on our separation from the <rs>North</rs>, and to remember only that the foe of the <rs>South</rs> is the foe of us all. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>But all this sad contrast we cheerfully, joyously look upon, and hold our lives ready for the sacrifice, too, whenever our country may demand them; for we are struggling in the cause of <name>Christian</name> freedom, and though life and property have a price, our principles have none.
