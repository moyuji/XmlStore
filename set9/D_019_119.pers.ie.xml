<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Yesterday, a steamer which had been above <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, blockading the entrance to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, attempted to go down to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>When nearly opposite the battery at <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName> a shot was fired from that place, which brought her to. She returned the fire, but after several shots had been exchanged between them, finding she could not pass the battery, she put back to the place from which she came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>She is now fastened in there, unless she passed out during the night --that was in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Yesterday afternoon the <term type="ship">tug</term> <rs type="ship">Young America</rs> ran up within a mile and exchanged <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> shots with the fort at <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>, but being backed out by the fire from the fort, she ran off to the <term type="ship">steam frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Minnesota</rs>, which came up and rounded to about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> (which is as near almost as she can approach) from the fort, and opened with shot and shell upon the battery at <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>, firing about <num value="15">fifteen</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The battery answered with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name> from several heavy guns, which caused her to back out, or rather they let her drift out of range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Her fire had no effect upon the battery, nor was any <num value="1">one</num> within it the least injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Whether she sustained any injury or not has not been ascertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The turning back of the steamer from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, I think, will be of great advantage, as the battery at <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName> will soon be in a condition to protect the entrance, and thus break up the blockade, so far as the passage from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> is concerned, in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>As the <rs>President</rs> had said, it seemed for a time that the affections of the people for the flag had gone in <num value="1">one</num> section, but this was a great error; the old flag is yet dear in all parts of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the people are coming forward everywhere to uphold and maintain it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> It was not because of the beauty of its colors &mdash; it was not because of the stars and stripes upon it &mdash; but because it is associated with all that is dear to <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> freedom, and because it is the emblem of freedom and glory &mdash; the emblem of popular government, so deep in the hearts of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>It is for this, and this only, the people are protecting it. Not as a party, because we have ceased to be a party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>No sight has ever been presented to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> eye, whether on the shores of our own country, or on a distant soil, or on the wide extended ocean, which is more calculated to warm our hearts, and excite our patriotism, and kindle anew the flame of love for country, than the sight of that glorious banner, the emblem of freedom and civil liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/> But if there ever was a day when the sight of that flag should excite afresh our patriotism and love of country, that day is now.--Treason has erected her hydra head and threatens now to crumble into ruins the glorious fabric of the <rs>Union</rs> cemented by the blood of our fathers, and to trail in the dust that flag which is looked to as the last hope of the oppressed throughout every part of the world.
