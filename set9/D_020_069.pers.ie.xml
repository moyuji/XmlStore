<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> --The slowness, uncertainly, and deficiency of railroad transportation in the <rs>South</rs>, especially in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, is producing a taxation upon the people vexations, onerous, and in the last degree unfortunate in its consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>At any other time than during a period of war, the people might afford to pay <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">seven dollars</measure> a sack for salt and <num value="20">twenty</num> and <measure n="30cents" type="currency">thirty cents</measure> a pound for sugars; but if they are forced unnecessarily to pay these prices during the pendency of war, a large tax is extorted from them by private speculators, which diminishes that far their capacity for contributing help to the country in its struggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> We have on former occasions shown that there is really no deficiency of salt in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>We have pointed out the specific means from which an increase of supply can be procured more than sufficient to compensate for any falling off from the stoppage of importations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But, notwithstanding that the supply is abundant, yet, owing to the failure of the railroads to transport it from the points of manufacture to the points of consumption, it is bringing in some localities the enormous price we have named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>There is especially in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> not only enough salt to supply her own wants, but enough also to furnish all they need to at least half the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It is blocked, however, for the want of transportation on the railroads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>We understand that many of the depots on the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee railroad</orgName> have considerable stocks of salt held by speculators, and that these are confident of making large profits on the property, from the belief that the road itself will not bring down salt from the <name>Salines</name>, in <placeName reg="Smyth, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002191">Smyth county</placeName>, in quantities to meet the demands of the market. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> Much allowance is to be made to the railroads for the heavy transportation they are obliged to do for the <rs>Government</rs>; but this should not be permitted to produce a total suspension of transportation for the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>If the railroads refuse to make arrangements for transporting ample supplies of such an article of necessity as salt for general consumption, they fail to perform their duty to the public, and become a curse to the community, by aiding and abetting in fact, however unintentionally, the extortions of speculators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>If all the salt that is manufactured at the <name>Salines</name> on the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee railroad</orgName>, were brought down by that corporation, there would be no difficulty in obtaining it at <measure n="2.25dollars" type="currency">$2.25</measure> a sack, the price demanded at the <name>Salines</name>, with the freight to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> added. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> What is said of this article is true of almost all others for which exorbitant prices are now demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>There is no reason why <rs n="brown sugar" type="product">brown sugars</rs> should be sold at the enormous prices now demanded for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>They can be got for <num value="6.5">six and a half</num> to <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> in New Orleans, which price, with the regular rates of freight added, would bring the cost in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to a figure that none could complain of. But the failure of the railroads to transport the article produces a deficiency of supply here, which places the people at the mercy of unconscionable speculators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>When it is recollected that the community have consented to a very heavy taxation for the purpose of constructing these railroads, their delinquency at the present time seems unpardonable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> Such is the intensity of this evil resulting from inefficiency of railroad transportation, that goods are now wagoned in many parts of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure> along the lines of the railroads, from the utter inability of the people to procure transportation for even necessaries of life upon their freight trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The evil calls aloud for reformation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>There can be no expense for the continuance systematically of an evil so galling and so crushing to the community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> While it is impossible to procure freights on the railroad or regular routes of freightage, Express companies seem to have no difficulty in getting their own costly transportation through; so that the only sure mode of procuring supplies by railroad, is by paying Express rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>This is a disreputable mode of evading the charter restrictions upon the railroads prohibiting higher rates than <measure n="8cents" type="currency">eight cents</measure> per ton per mile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> Not only might sugar, salt, and nearly all articles of Southern production, be procured at reasonable rates, if the railroads would only transport the freight of the people, but many articles not of Southern growth could be materially brought down in price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>We understand the depots in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> are filled with dry and <rs n="miscellaneous goods" type="product">miscellaneous goods</rs> brought in from the <rs>North</rs> before the communications with the enemy were cut off; and that there would be no scarcity of the larger variety of goods needed by the public, if only the railroads would bring on the freight waiting for transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The people might be saved, probably, half the expenses of the war, in the lower prices they would have to pay for supplies and goods, if only the railroads could be brought to do their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>We trust that the attention and scrutiny of the public will be fixed upon the subject until some reform is wrought of <num value="1">one</num> of the most oppressive evils of the day. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> --The weather for the last <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> has been splendid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The earth, saturated heretofore by an unusual quantity of rain, has become thoroughly dried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The streams have resumed their usual channels, or shrunk within their usual borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The atmosphere is exceedingly brilliant, reminding us of that purest of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> seasons, the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> Summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>There never was more propitious weather for military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>And we are reminded by the date at the head of this day's issue, that the equinox is upon us, unaccompanied by its usual concomitants of clouds, rain, and storms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It seems as though Nature herself had espoused our cause, and invited us to move forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We cannot always calculate upon her favors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>In a few days she may shroud herself in clouds and drench the earth once more by rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>We hope our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> will take advantage of the opportunity, and seize the initiative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>He must be seized by the forelock, or be will forever elude the grasp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> We have not in this journal presumed to criticise the movements of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We could not but see, what all the world must have seen, that a movement in advance <num value="1">one</num> day, or <num value="1">one</num> week, or even <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, after the battle of Mannassa, would have resulted in advantages to our cause, which it is almost impossible to conceive, far less to estimate with mathematical precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>We could not resist the belief that men, who had fled as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had fled from that field, could not be made to stand behind any fortifications, how formidable soever they might be, if attacked by strong arms and resolute hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>We could not be induced to think that the respect due to tried veterans ought to be paid to these routed, terrified, discouraged, panic-stricken relies of a military mob, whom no persuasion of their officers, and no sentiment of honor, bad induced to stand and look our army in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We felt confident that the best way to deal with such men was to assail them boldly, no matter what their numbers might be, without waiting a moment to count the cost of the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>We <unclear> ure</unclear> they would never stand the test, for <unclear> ew</unclear> that they were disbanding daily, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> that they were totally regardless of military discipline, that they were strewed all over <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, lying drunk in the rum shops, on the cellar doors, in the gutters, and thinking of nothing but getting back home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We were satisfied then, we are satisfied now; that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Washington,John,A.,,:2"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> might have been taken by a handful of men, almost by a charge of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>We could not understand the advantages of delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>We knew nothing of military tactics; but the modicum of common sense with which we were gifted by our Creator, enabled us to doubt the policy which left to a conquered and dispirited enemy the leisure to recover from his terror, to restore discipline, recruit his forces, to drill his men, to erect gigantic fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>But we said nothing of all this, because our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> had the matter in their own hands, and best knew what they were capable of performing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>When, therefore, we learned that their reason for not following a panic-stricken enemy <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> was that they had not provision and transportation sufficient to carry them that distance, we thought the public ought to be satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We had read, nevertheless, that <hi rend="smallcaps">C&#x00E6;sar</hi> had pursued <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Pompey</foreName></persName></hi> from the plains of Thessaly to the sea beach of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, after the battle of Pharsalia, although previously to that battle he had been on the point of breaking up his camp for want of provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>We had, moreover, read the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proclamation of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bonaparte,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName></hi> to his army in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, in which he tells them that in the course of <measure n="14days" type="date">fourteen days</measure> they had gained <num value="6">six</num> victories and destroyed <num value="2">two</num> armies; that they had <q>&#x0022;gained battles without cannon, crossed rivers without <hi rend="italics">pontons,</hi> made forced marches without shoes, and watched all night under arms without brandy, and sometimes even without provisions&#x0022;</q>--that they had been <q>&#x0022;bereft even of necessaries at the commencement of the campaign,&#x0022;</q> but that now (at the date of the proclamation) <q>&#x0022;they enjoyed plenty,&#x0022;</q> for that <q>&#x0022;the magazines taken from the enemy were numerous.&#x0022;</q> Still the public, deeply as they were chagrined at the disappointment, acquiesced in the apology for the <rs>Generals</rs>, that they had not transportation and provisions for so short a distance, and we felt no disposition to disturb its verdict. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> We have already said that the advantages which would have ensued to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> from an advance at that period, were not to be estimated by any process known to arithmetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Some of them, however, lie so palpably on the surface that we cannot forbear to notice them in passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>We should have captured the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and purged it of the foul vermin who have converted it into a nest for their tribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We should have prevented the abduction and incarceration of our friends, who have been abducted and incarcerated only because they were our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>We should have captured the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, and by throwing a strong body of troops upon the rear of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> marauders in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, have rendered their capture and destruction inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>We should have protected <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> from invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>We should have arrested the progress of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> arms in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and placed that gallant State in her true position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We should have enabled <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> to purge off the vile locusts that infest her. We should have entered the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> territory, and made them tremble for their own capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We should have taken <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and held it as a pledge for the withdrawal of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:5"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> scoundrels from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and of his fleet from the blockade of our ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>In a word, we should have gone into the midst of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, broken up their military organization, laid <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and New York at our feet, compelled them to sue for terms, and exacted ample indemnity for all their robberies, all their injuries, and all their insults. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> Another opportunity now offers itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>We have a numerous army on the <rs>Potomac</rs> &mdash; it burns for distinction, and pants for the hour that is to call it into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>If its ardor be not restrained, before <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName> it can plant the colors of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> upon <placeName reg="Fanueil Hall">Fanueil Hall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It will have battles to fight; but that is what it most eagerly longs for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>If they cannot be crossed at <num value="1">one</num> place, they can at another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>When did the <rs>Rhine</rs> ever constitute an insuperable object to an army wishing to invade <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, or the <rs>Po</rs> to an army wishing to invade <placeName key="tgn,7003237" n="1.000 6" reg="lombardy">Lombardy</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>When did any great river offer an insuperable obstacle to a resolute General and a brave army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> Having just returned from a long and very interesting ride, a description of which would prove quite readable did not prudence forbid it, I seat myself to give you an item or <num value="2">two</num>, which is all the present quiet will afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Stern necessity will compel me to write with steam-engine speed to the conclusion of this letter, and to cut it extremely short, or else be left in darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>On going to our room this evening it was found that our landlord had run completely out of candles, and that there were none for sale in the village of <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>From this predicament we were relieved by a lieutenant in the army, who kindly gave us <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> of his own. While this short piece is rapidly wasting away, I take advantage of its feeble illumination and improve the time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> For some time this village has been quite lively, owing to the number of men, horses, and vehicles of every description and variety, which have through its streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Early in the morning, when the crowd is greatest; when the heavy wagons keep up a continuous rattle; when soldiers are shooting, mules braying, dragoons riding by with clanking sabres, drums beating, and there is a constant Babel of strange noises, <num value="1">one</num> could easily fancy a market day in <placeName key="tgn,7012122" n="1.000 1" reg="armagh,armagh,northern ireland,united kingdom,europe">Armagh</placeName>, or that, by some <hi rend="italics">hocus pocus,</hi> he had been suddenly dropped into the midst of <placeName reg="Donny Brook, Montgomery, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2292372">Donny brook</placeName> fair.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/> I am happy to record still further evidences of the improved health of the army, and of the return of a great number of those who have been on sick leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The cars never fail to bring in more or less, and I believe the regiments can now turn out more men to battalion drill or dress parade than at any time for the past <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>They were on picket duty, and, animated with the best of intentions, desired to stop the picket firing which is kept up so constantly; but in doing so they violated a rule of the army, and were ordered to report themselves under arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Their endeavors to stop the barbarous practice of pickets skulking behind fences and laying in rifle-pits, in order to get a shot at the guards opposite, was certainly laudable, but it might have been done possibly without a meeting or an exchange of compliments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>A short time ago a well-known newspaper man, who has been for years a severe fire-eater and strongly in favor of opening the slave trade, was arrested at the instigation of a female custodian of the public welfare as a suspicious character.

With this circumstance in mind, I was much amused at an old lady a few miles below this place, who evidently kept a sharp look-out on all strangers who might prove emissaries of the <name>Round</name> heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>Reporter still oblivious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Finally, the work is completed, the notes go into a side pocket, the book is folded, pen wiped, and inkstand put away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/> Reporter very suddenly subsides, but immediately draws sundry papers containing his record, which he spreads upon the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Smiles of satisfaction gradually creep over all faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>Play concludes by finding all parties satisfied, old lady having introduced pretty black-eyed daughter to the roving <rs>Bohemian</rs> and suspected spy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the principal features of the village of <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName> is the great number of beautiful horses that daily pass through it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It is true, the cavalry is encamped not many miles away, and are frequently seen in the village; but, aside from it, everybody seems taken with the strong desire of having a fine horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The finest and best, probably, are those owned by gentlemen from the extreme <rs>South</rs>, who have expended large sums in order to get good animals.--Many of them are blooded horses, or racers of known reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>This evening I met a <persName n="Major,,Georgia,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="default:Major,Georgia,,,"><foreName>Georgia</foreName> <surname>Major</surname></persName> riding a racer well known on the <rs>Southern</rs> turf, and another mounted on <num value="1">one</num> of <rs type="ship2">Vixen</rs>'s finest colts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/><rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Captain">Captains</rs>, and <rs type="role2">Lieutenants</rs> vie with each other in the character of their stock; and so universal has the furor become, that the newspaper correspondents have been drawn into it. <num value="1">One</num> of these has purchased a beautiful black mare, for which he gave <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">two hundred and fifty dollars</measure>--wonder where he got it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Your <q>&#x0022;Own&#x0022;</q> has a fine bay, on which, like a modern <placeName key="possibilities=12" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Atlas</placeName>, he carries about with him, from place to place, in the process of dispensing and collecting news, the little world of intelligence which you daily see in the correspondence from the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/> The necessity of being well mounted at this place is evident from the fact that we have very long journeys to make sometimes to gain matter enough for a single paragraph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The camps being sometimes <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> apart, it will be seen at a glance that it is no easy task to visit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>After a journey on horseback, over roads by no means inviting, it will not be strange if I give you occasional letters remarkable for dullness, or that I should not write at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>A good deal of interest was felt on their return, <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after, to learn what they had done; for the sight of strange ambulances and horses, and men in <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> uniforms, looked very much as though they has-been in pleasant proximity to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>And so it was. Their design was particularly against a barn in which were stationed a body of advance Federals; but on charging it, they found that the birds had flown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Determined, however, to strike a blow in the face of the enemy before returning, they charged a distance of <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> over a boggy and broken road, upon their pickets, capturing several, together with <num value="3">three</num> ambulances and a number of arms and knapsacks, and returning unscathed to camp. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>But supposing the horses to be shortly forthcoming, many are altogether unable to imagine where the riders will be found.
