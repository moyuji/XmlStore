<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> This subject, which we touched upon the other day, is of so much interest that we shall be excused for calling it up again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> We adverted there to the great cost of this arm of the service, and should have adverted, though we believe we did not, to the difficulty of procuring subsistence for the horses in the present condition of agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>These are the <hi rend="italics">principal</hi> objections to an increase of the cavalry force, especially the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We thought, as it was so costly, and so difficult to sustain, and as the instances in which it had proved decisive of great battles had been mostly confined to open countries, the question of increase required some examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We had the old maxim of the <name>Great Frederick</name> before us, that &#x0022;the cavalry ought to depend on the spur&#x0022;--that is, to the impetuosity of its onset in a body, breaking a line by the weight of the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>In confirmation of this was the opinion of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, that upon the whole the cavalry could beat the infantry, and of <persName n="Mitchell,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, who wrote a book to sustain the same position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>To these opinions might be added that of <num value="1">one</num> of our own ablest and most experienced <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, who, it is said, upon being asked why it was that cavalry, in general, did not succeed in breaking squares of infantry, bluntly replied, &#x0022;because they do not cut their bridles,&#x0022; significantly intimating that the horses were checked too soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>This sentiment is almost identical with that entertained by <persName n="Mitchell,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, who says he was in <num value="1">one</num> of the squares at the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs>, and can testify that the <sic>curassiers</sic> invariably pulled up he'ere they got within bayonet reach, and intimates that if they had precipitated themselves on them they must inevitably have broken every <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>This was the way in which we viewed the matter; cavalry charging a wavering, or a retreating, or a flying column, breaking it, routing it, and never suffering it to rally.--We thought this could only be done in an open and level, or comparatively level, country &mdash; and as this was the principal use of cavalry, and it was very expensive and difficult to sustain, it appeared to us that our military authorities perhaps acted wisely, considering the character of our country, in not enlarging that description of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Since our article on this subject was published we have had a conversation with an intelligent officer of cavalry, which leads us to think that our views, as there expressed, were entirely wrong, and as we entered into the subject for the good of the service, we take pleasure in acknowledging that we stand corrected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> Our cavalry are armed with carbines, and are taught to act, upon occasion, as <orgName n="Light Infantry" type="infantry">light infantry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>If in charging a discomfited enemy he should rally in a thicket, the men would be dismounted, and attack them under cover, with the assistance of the <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> by which every body of cavalry is attended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>If, therefore, the cavalry force were large enough, they could keep him on the run when once started, and prevent him from rallying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>This is certainly much better than if they were compelled to send for an infantry force to dislodge him. Again, our battles are generally fought on a widely-extended front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>If it is necessary to reinforce any part of the line, the cavalry can do it in <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> part of the time which would be required by the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>This is another inestimable advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>With regard to the efficiency of cavalry in pursuit, the officer in question thinks if we had possessed a sufficient force of that description at the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs>, we might have taken <measure n="20000" type="prisoners">twenty thousand prisoners</measure>; that is, we might have entirely destroyed that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Such being the facts, as represented to us, we not only abandon our objections to the increase of that arm, but we will co-operate cordially with those who are endeavoring to obtain an increase. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> In the <rs>French</rs> army, immediately under the command of the <rs>Emperor</rs>, every corps (we believe, every division) had its own cavalry and its own artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Besides this, there was always a heavy body of horse, and a powerful force of artillery, kept under the hand of the <rs>Emperor</rs>, the former commanded by <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>This he used to precipitate upon the enemy when his line wavered, and it was generally overwhelming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>At the <rs n="Battle of Austerlitz" type="battle">battle of Austerlitz</rs>, when every part of the allied army had been routed, except the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>, commanded by Bagration, and when that officer was slowly and steadily retiring before Lannes, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> ordered <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> to charge him in flank with <num value="4000">four thousand</num> of d'hautpone's curassiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The effect was instantaneous and decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>At <placeName reg="Jena, Loudon, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099764">Jena</placeName>, when the <name>Prussian</name> were retreating in something like order, he let loose <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> upon them with <num value="12000">12,000</num> cavalry and the retreat instantly became a flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>If <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had such a body of cavalry always by him, under the command of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Job,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, he might turn his next victory into the total destruction of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> In the conscription, we believe, only infantry are selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>We should think that cavalry also should be conscribed and horses furnished them by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>For <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of dollars, <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> cavalry horses of good quality might be furnished, and it would be money well spent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It is too much to make the soldier furnish his own horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>It entails an expense which few are able to bear, and effectually depresses the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> P. S.--Since the above was written, the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi>--the contemporary to which we alluded &mdash; has published a reply to our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> presents some very strong points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/><num value="1">One</num> of these goes far to obviate our principal objection, arising out of the difficulty of making cavalry as efficient as it was in the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> battles to which we alluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It is this the fences have all been over thrown within the theatre of operations, thus leaving a clear sweep for the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>We have always beard the fences spoken of as the principal impediment &mdash; as being, in fact, the only obstacle to the assumption by the cavalry of that importance to which they are entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> attributed an equal importance to all <num value="3">three</num> arms &mdash; infantry, artillery, and cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>He did not consider a body of men an army without the <num value="3">three</num> in proper proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>When he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took the command of the army of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> he found its cavalry indifferent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He employed it comparatively little in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="6">six</num> battles, because they were fought among the <name>Appenuines</name> or on the spurs and ridges of those mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>But when he had crossed the <rs>Po</rs>, and advanced into the level plains of <placeName key="tgn,7003237" n="1.000 6" reg="lombardy">Lombardy</placeName>, he determined to make it as available as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Accordingly, in the combat of Fomblo, he placed it in such a position as to make it do the principal part of the fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>It had been before timid and afraid to encounter the <name>Austrian</name> (or rather Hungarian) regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>That day it was forced to fight, and having discovered that it <hi rend="italics">could</hi> fight, and <hi rend="italics">conquer</hi> too, it never afterwards showed any timidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/><persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> was then rising, and he soon established his reputation, and that of his command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> The <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> mentions another very important fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and Dutchmen can't ride, and can't be taught to ride; whereas the <rs>Southern States</rs> contain a body of horsemen the finest in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>This fact ought to show in what direction our exertions should be applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>By all means let us have <num value="40000">40,000</num> or <num value="50000">50,000</num> more cavalry this spring.--There is many a Murat in the <rs>South</rs>, if only the <hi rend="italics">opportunity</hi> were granted. </p> </div3>
