<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The quiet of yesterday was unbroken by even a roamer from the armies on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Active hostilities seem to have been suspended, at least for the present, yet the large bodies of troops confronting each other are by no means idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>With regard to the movements and disposition of our forced we receive an occasional report, to which publicity need not be given, for reasons of a presidential nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Although <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> age a battle appeared imminent, the indications now are that the event will be postponed for a period, since <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:2"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is so situated that he can make no offensive demonstration with his army on land, and if and attack were to be made by the <rs>Confederates</rs> it would not be without due preparation such preparation indeed as would ensure complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The excitement consequent upon the recent confects has subsided, and our inhabitants, assured of <unclear></unclear> of the <rs>Capital</rs>, patiently await the next <unclear></unclear> of the seen which opens another phase in dreams of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The check put upon the gunboat operations by our batteries at <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName> is a source of much annoyance to the <rs>Federal</rs> leaders; but whether another attempt at their reduction will shortly be made, or delayed until the <q>&#x0022;Army of the <rs>Potomac</rs>&#x0022;</q> is reinforced and reorganized on the <rs>James</rs>, is purely a matter of conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>For nearly a week that army has fought against overpowering numbers, and though compelled to fall back, has fought bravely, repulsing the enemy from time to time, with great slaughter, nowhere permitting its flank to be turned or its front to be broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Retiring by a dangerous and difficult might march, through forests and swamps, exposed to constant attack, harassed by an enemy hovering about them and constantly reinforced by innumerable and fresh troops, our brave soldiers made their way, through almost inconceivable difficulties, to the point aimed at on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Turkey bridge">Turkey bridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Before we come to any fixed opinion on this matter of reinforcements, on which there is much unintelligent if not idle discussion, it is as well that the public should be informed that not much, if any, loss than <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men have been added to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> within a month; that still other and large reinforcements were some time since ordered forward, and are now on their way, nor far off; and that probably in the military plans of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, of which, of course, nobody but himself and the <rs>Government</rs> could know anything, <unclear></unclear> for their accomplishment was placed upon this very conjunction with a large naval force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Before unquestioned blame is attached anywhere, let us be quite are that we know all the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Reinforcement was to be made at a given time to both sides; if the enemy, in their desperation, were the speedier in their action &mdash; the speedier, because their facilities in a given case were the greater haste is not always the most speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It is their turn to-day; it may be ours to-morrow.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> Yesterday was a day of intense excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It has had few equals in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The ambiguous utterances of the morning papers &mdash; the sullen silence of the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; the evident restraint of comment &mdash; the ill concealed anxiety of those who ought to be at case &mdash; the imperious call for men &mdash; the erratic movements of cabinet officers &mdash; the restiveness of the people under all this apparently designed mortification &mdash; all conspired to raise a fever in the public mind of unequalled fervor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>We were called upon early in the morning to give, in an extra edition, a dispatch from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> of most unsatisfactory character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> It represented that a gunboat had arrived from the scene of action, yesterday, (<dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>,) <placeName><distance reg="10miles">10 miles</distance> above <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName></placeName>; it went on to say that division [what division] had fought <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> and retreated <measure n="17miles" type="distance">17 miles</measure>. If that division was a portion of <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s right wing</orgName>, the <measure n="17miles" type="distance">17 miles</measure> is easily understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The dispatch jumps at once to the fight of yesterday, (<dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>,) and says it was terrific, the enemy having <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>--the old, old story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It was begun by our land forces, who fought <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>; then our gunboats got in range and gave the <rs>Confederates</rs> much trouble; they stood it for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, and then retired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> Then we are told that our men took many cannon and <measure n="2000" type="prisoners">2,000 prisoners</measure>--among them <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName>, (Most excellent news, if true,) All this took place at <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, bend or bridge, about <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> above <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName></placeName>. <measure n="17miles" type="distance">Seventeen miles</measure> of retreat from this place would bring our army down to the place &mdash; <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName>'s Bar &mdash; where <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had his headquarters (so says a later dispatch) on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>But then the <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> correspondent abruptly adds that <q>&#x0022;the retreat of the <rs>Confederates</rs> last evening (that's Monday) was with great disorder, and their loss has been very heavy, much greater, it is thought, than ours.&#x0022;</q> But he adds that nothing deficits is known about losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>And he immediately adds, with sublime disregard of time, place or continuity, that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had to spike his siege guns and leave them on the debt, the nature of the ground rendering their removal impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> Upon this meas of unintelligible stuff, the public were left to ruminate until late in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>There was almost universal gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Now and then a credulous believer in the <name>Immaculate</name> talent of a great man, would oracularly pronounce <q>&#x0022;all right; only keeping back the good news for the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>,&#x0022;</q> but his followers were few and for between; even the ardent hope which has so long sustained us flagged and was fast giving way to despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>From this thickening gloom the city was partially roused at <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> by a dispatch hailing from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, reading as follows: &#x0022;A dispatch from <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, just received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, dated, From <persName n="Berkeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Berkeley,nomatch:0"><surname>Berkeley</surname></persName>, <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName>'s bar, <date value="07-02">July 2,</date> <time value="5:30pm">5.30 P. M.</time>, stating that he has succeeded in getting his army to <unclear></unclear> place, on the banks of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and <unclear></unclear> but <num value="1">one</num> gun, which had to be abandoned for daylight (<dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>) because it broke down; that <unclear></unclear> and <num value="0.5">a half</num> ago the rest of the wages train <unclear></unclear> a mile of the weep and only war wages <unclear></unclear> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> It is needless to say that this, brief and unsatisfactory as it is, gave most welcome belief to a <num value="1000000">million</num> of anxious minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The army was not bearer &mdash; so they reasoned; all was &mdash; or would be &mdash; right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Yet the statement of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> that no guns were lost was inexplicable; other reports, apparently truthful, said that he had lost dozens; but this late at news came from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>--they could not deceive the people &mdash; certainly not intentionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>So, opinion was rather in favor of the latest dispatch; and the painful suspense of the people was measurably relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>In this state of mind, the city entered upon the eve of the national anniversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>But the customary hilarity was not manifest; the evening was cold and gloomy, and even the irrepressible patriotism of <placeName key="tgn,2000536" n="1.000 4" reg="warren, illinois">Young America</placeName> was tame and spiritless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> Our next telegraphic advices, in order of date, are from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, <date value="07-02"> July 2,</date> endorsed <q>&#x0022;By Mail to the <rs>Associated Press</rs>.&#x0022;</q> The reports from the army by this correspondent are to <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, inclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>That was the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> day of continuous fighting all along our lines, a fight that for destructiveness of life has no parallel in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Our killed, wounded, and missing are estimated at <num value="15000">15,000</num> to <num value="20000">20,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>This letter denies the loss of the siege guns, stating that nearly all were brought safely off. <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and his staff agree that the army has got into a much better position by the great movement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> Some of our regiments have suffered terribly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>For instance, the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY5">5th New York</orgName> lost <num value="300">300</num>, after most heroic fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The enemy everywhere outnumbered us; they had <num value="185000">185,000</num> effective men &mdash; <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> not more than <num value="195000">195,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Next we had a dispatch from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, but it is suppressed at the dictation of <persName n="Sandford,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Sandford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sandford</surname></persName>, Military Supervisor of Telegraphic Dispatches.

<head>Never relax!</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> The <q>&#x0022;syren song&#x0022;</q> of intervention is again raised, it must be confessed with more appearance of reason now than at any former period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/><q>&#x0022;Heed not the voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely,&#x0022;</q> is our advice to all who have influence in official quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Foreign powers may intervene or they may not. Their intervention or their declining to intervene, should make not the slightest difference with us. We should remember <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and the fearful consequences that followed from that great victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>It has been said, and we believe with some degree of truth, that our victory on that day was fully as disastrous to us as a signal defeat would have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>It caused us to relax our efforts and to slumber in the hope that foreign nations would step in and relieve us from our difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>How delusive all such anticipations proved to be we need not here remind our readers or our authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The moment following a great victory is, of all others, except the moment after defeat, the moment when a nation should put forward its full strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Victory, if complete, must be followed up; if indecisive, it must be made complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We have sufficient confidence in our Government to believe that it properly appreciates this matter, and will act upon it to the fullest extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Let the army be increased to its utmost capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Let the strictest discipline be established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>and preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Let struggling, and absences with out leave, be stopped short by the highest penalty known to the military code, should that become necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Let the army be what it was designed to be made by the conscription &mdash; a great standing army, subject to military law in its utmost rigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>In this way, and in this way only, can we preserve our magnificent force in its full efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>For fighting, it may challenge a comparison with any other that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>But it has not yet felly appreciated the absolute necessity of keeping together after a battle, and thereby enabling itself to reap the full benefit of its valor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> To us it appears very obvious that foreign powers will not recognize us, until compelled by their own necessities to take that stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It is very certain that, whatever may be the sentiments of the people they represent, these Governments have but little sympathy for us, or at least that they have not enough to induce say risk of a war as the penalty of recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>If they recognize us at all, it will be because they cannot do without our products, and cannot obtain those products by any other means, or because they wish to see the power of the old Union crippled, or because they wish to come in for a large share of the coasting trade, or because of other reasons equally selfish, and equally distinct from any love of justice or fair play, or abstract affection for us. Let us hug no such phantom to our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Let us go on fighting and preparing to fight, as though we and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were the only nations left upon the face of the earth.
