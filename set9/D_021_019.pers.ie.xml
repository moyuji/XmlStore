<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This was pronounced a very fit place for a very great city; but there was some contention about it between <persName n="Gosnold,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Gosnold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Gosnold</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wingfield,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Wingfield,nomatch:0"><surname>Wingfield</surname></persName> even after the provisions were landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Here they commenced the settlement of <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName>, which was, as it proved, the small beginning of our now great and prosperous Confederacy.&#x0022;</q> Hence the city of <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The subsequent struggles of the new colony, its growth, the exploits of its founders, <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Smith,John,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gosnold,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Gosnold,nomatch:0"><surname>Gosnold</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName>, <persName n="Ratcliff,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Ratcliff,nomatch:0"><surname>Ratcliff</surname></persName>, <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Martin,J.,G.,,:1"><surname>Martin</surname></persName>, and others, have become as familiar as household words through the pages of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>For the next century the record of the <name>Colony</name> was <num value="1">one</num> of many difficulties, but of gradual growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <num value="2">two</num> ensuing summers were spent by <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Smith,John,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> and his companions, in exploring the numerous rivers, bays, inlets, and <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs> surrounding the country by <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName>, and in conquering them by arms, or winning them by treaty with the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Slowly as time progressed the <name>Colonial</name> wilds of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> became inhabited by <name>English</name> emigrants, and <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the daring adventurers who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settled them passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> of wealth and influence became planters, purchased lands in the new world, and brought out tenantry to cultivate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The culture of tobacco became a source of wealth, and hundreds were tempted by the prospect of gain to leave their <name>English</name> homes for the new found <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">El Dorado</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>For the next <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> after the settlement of <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName> the number of planters rapidly increased; but still the affairs of the colony did not thrive equal to the expectations of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In <dateStruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></dateStruct>, the same year Miles Standish put his foot on the <q>&#x0022;blarney stone&#x0022;</q> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, <num value="1261">twelve hundred and sixty-one</num> additional settlers were induced to emigrate, but they soon became dissatisfied, and cherished the hope of a speedy return to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Like men who rushed to the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs> in the years <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, they left the comforts of civilization for the sake of gain, and soon found out the difference between a comfortable home in Britain and life in the wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But then there were few women in the country; and what else could have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In order to attach them more closely to the settlement, and to render the colony more permanent, <num value="90">ninety</num> young women, of a reputable character, were sent over to become the wives of the planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>So good an effect did these <num value="90">ninety</num> young women, of a reputable character, have upon the community in the bush, that they were soon followed by <num value="60">sixty</num> more, (of whose character or characteristics history says nothing,) sent at the expense of the <rs>English Colonial Company</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Thereafter women came in every ship, the planters paying the cost of their transportation; and so well did these young women conduct themselves that the price of a wife rose from <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> to <measure n="150l." type="pounds"><num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> pounds</measure> of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>After this there was very little discontent, and the settlements increased rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The next year the <orgName n="London Company" type="company">London Company</orgName> granted their Colony a written constitution, and a local Government was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>So things went on prosperously until the reign of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName></persName> was over; then came <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> I, <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>, and finally the <name>Georges</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>And through all the years &mdash; through many difficulties &mdash; the settlements in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> continued to grow in wealth and importance. </p>

<head>The extensive frontier of the <rs>South</rs></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> Few of our people have any comprehension of the impossibility of defending at all points such an extensive frontier as that of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>To protect it completely would require an army concentrated at the innumerable points essential to defence as large as the entire population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The seacoast itself, if there were no inland frontier, is so immense, and abounds with indents, bayous, harbors, and easy landing places, that to guard it effectually without a navy is literally an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>But when it is recollected that, in addition to this, we have an enormous inland frontier, only separated in some contiguous Northern States by an imaginary life, and in others by rivers, which the naval force of the enemy enables them to command; and that, besides all this, an immense territory in the region of the <rs>Southwest</rs> is penetrated by the <rs>Ohio</rs> and <rs>Mississippi</rs>, thus giving us a fresh-water frontier in the heart of our country as large and exposed as that on the <rs>Atlantic</rs> borders, we think it must be conceded that, to prevent the enemy from making <num value="1">one</num> or a dozen lodgments upon various points of our soil, especially when he outnumbers us <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, is more than can be expected of any Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Our only wonder is, considering the immense advantages of the enemy for assault, whilst we stand purely upon the defensive, that we have been able so long to prevent him from destroying or occupying most of our seaport and river towns, and from advancing into the interior from more than <num value="1">one</num> important base of operation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> Considering our limited means of defence, both in arms and munitions of war, and the boundless supply of both possessed by the enemy, we may be thankful to <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that the loyal portion of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is still almost intact, and submit with philosophy to any temporary advantages of this kind which they may obtain, as inevitable by any means at our command, and therefore not to be attributed to the fault of our Government or its military leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It may consols us also to remember that the occupation of any city of the <rs>South</rs>, whether on our sea coast or the rivers, would not be decisive in any degree of the great contest in which we are engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The population, their resources, the spirit, soul and statesmanship of the <rs>South</rs> are in the country, not the towns, and the latter might be occupied for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> or a century by a foreign army without destroying the strength or corrupting the patriotism of the country population. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> If the <rs>South</rs> is in earnest in its determination to be independent of the most base, fanatical, and cruel despotism that has existed in modern times, it will at least manifest the patience and perseverance of its Revolutionary forefathers, who endured the trials, misfortunes, and disasters of <num value="7">seven</num> long years, and were willing to have toiled through <num value="70">seventy</num> more rather than submit to grievances which, compared with those inflicted upon the <rs>South</rs>, are lighter than gossamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>For years did our <name>British</name> adversary hold not only cities, seaboard and inland towns, but dominated over whole States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Defeat followed defeat, and misfortune, But the spirit of the true men of that day was heard in the voice of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> when he declared that, if all else failed him, he would raise the flag of independence in the mountains of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and there bid defiance to the enemies of his country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>If, under circumstances calculated to beget despair, the <rs>North</rs>, which is acting as the aggressor, shows no symptoms of discouragement, how puerile and shameful were the <rs>South</rs>, the victor in almost every battle, and engaged in a struggle in which surrender is ruin, to croak and despond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We do not believe that such is the temper and such the spirit of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We feel convinced that, however disagreeable may be those occasional inroads of the enemy into our territory, which cannot be prevented, the <rs>South</rs> has entire confidence in its leaders, and the most unalterable determination to wait, and hope and live for independence no matter how long and how vexatious the period of probation. </p> </div3>
