<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> During the fire, when <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s flag-staff was shot away, a boat put off from <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, carrying another <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag for him to fight under &mdash; a noteworthy instance of the honor and chivalry of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> seceders and their admiration for a brave man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> During the raging of the flames in <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, the officers and soldiers were obliged to lay on their faces in the casemates to prevent suffocation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> expressed himself much pleased that no lives had been sacrificed, and says that to <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> alone is to be attributed the bloodless victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He compliments the firing of the <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinian</rs>, and the large number of exploded shells lying around attest their effectiveness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The number of soldiers in the fort was about <num value="70">seventy</num>, besides <num value="25">twenty-five</num> workmen, who assisted at the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>His stock <unclear>of</unclear> provisions was almost exhausted, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He would have been starved out in <num value="2">two</num> more days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The entrance to the fort is mined, and the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> officers who visited it after the surrender were told to be careful on account of the heat, lest it should explode. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The scene in the city after the raising of the flag of truce and the surrender is indescribable; the people were perfectly wild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Men on horseback rode through the streets proclaiming the news, amid the greatest enthusiasm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The forces of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> were entirely inadequate to effectually work the guns and attend to the incidental requirements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is not to be wondered at, under the circumstances, that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The men were on duty <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>, with balls or shells striking the casemates and guns of the fort constantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Competent military men state that the intense vibration or shock produced on the brain and nervous system of those in the vicinity is terribly exhausting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> At the siege of <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2650582">Sebastopol</placeName> the men who worked the guns were relieved every <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, and groomed with whiskey and flannel to enable them to endure the concussion produced by the firing of their own guns and the shock of the enemy's balls and shells striking the fortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The concussion attending the firing of a columbiad in the enclosed casemate of a fort is said to be terrible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> In contrast with the conduct of the inaction of the war fleet, it is stated that an old slave passed through the hottest fire, with a sloop load of wool, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, and came safely to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Somebody told him he would be killed in the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><q>&#x0022;Can't help dat, &#x0022;</q> said he, <q>&#x0022;must go to de town to night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If anybody hurts dis chile or dis boat, massa see him about it shuah.&#x0022;</q> His sloop received <num value="4">four</num> shots. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The fort is burned into a mere shell; not a particle of wood-work can be found, The guns on <num value="1">one</num> side of the parapet are entirely dismounted, others split, while the gun carriages are knocked into splinters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> says the accuracy of the firing surprised him, and that if he had had <num value="200">two hundred</num> more men, <num value="0.5">one-half</num> would have been killed for want of suitable protection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> says it is preposterous to fight such a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><num value="1">One</num> of the officers in the fort remarked that they had endeavored not to fire on exposed individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><q>&#x0022;Yes,&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;I gave orders not to sight men, but to silence batteries.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Both men and officers were begrimed with smoke and powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The batteries which have done the most mischief are the <orgName n="Dahigrea battery" type="battery">Dahigrea battery</orgName>, <orgName n="Stevens Battery" type="battery">Stevens' battery</orgName>, and the rifle can non. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> As regards harbor defence, the fort is just as good as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The casemates are perfect, the guns there in prime condition, and bear on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was obliged to throw overboard a large quantity of powder to prevent explosion, and it was floating around the fort to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the aids carried brandy to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> in a boat, after the fire, and the latter said it was very acceptable, as the men were completely exhausted by their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I mention this to show the kind and chivalrous relations between the officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Before going into action, <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> sent word by an aid of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> to the <rs>Governor</rs>, thanking him for kind attentions during the past <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, and very solemnly said, <q>&#x0022;Farewell, gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> papers of Monday reached us last night, bringing full details of the bombardment and surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>We make some interesting extracts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The Mercury thus continues its narrative of the bombardment, as follows: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/> As dawn approached, the firing again abated, and when the rising sun threw its flood of light over the sparkling waters from a cloudless sky, it was but by random shots from outlying batteries, with scarce an answer from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, that spectators were assured the contest still continued, and that human feeling was not in harmony with the grace and glory of the scene, It was but a little while, however, before the energy of action was restored, and as the work of destruction still went on, it was feared that still another day of expectation and uncertainty was before us. But at <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> the cry arose from the wharves, and rolled in <num value="1">one</num> continuous wave over the city, <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is on Fire !&#x0022; </hi></q> The watchers of the night before, who had retired for a few moments, were aroused, occupations were instantly suspended, and old and young either mounted to their points of observation, or rolled in crowds upon the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, to look upon the last and most imposing act in this great drama. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The barracks to the <rs>South</rs> had been <num value="3">three</num> times set on fire during the bombardment of the day before, but each time the flames were immediately extinguished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Subsequently, however, a red- hot shot from <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, or shell from elsewhere, found a lodgment, when the fact was not apparent, and the fire, smouldering for a time, at length broke forth, and flames and smoke rose in volumes from the crater of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The wind was blowing from the <rs>West</rs>, driving the smoke across the fort and into the embrasures, where the gunners were at work, and pouring its volumes through the port holes; the firing of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> appeared to be renewed with vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>The fire of the fort, long, fierce and rapid, however, was gradually abated, and although at distant intervals a gun was fired, the necessity of preserving their magazines and of avoiding the flames left the tenants little leisure for resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>But the firing from without was continued with redoubled vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Every battery poured in its ceaseless round of shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The enthusiasm of success inspired their courage and gave precision to their action; and thus, as in the opening, so in the closing scene, under the beaming sunlight, in view of <num value="1000">thousands</num> crowded upon the wharves and house tops, and amid the booming of ordnance, and in view of the <num value="5">five</num> immense ships sent by the enemy with reinforcements, lying idly just out of gun-shot on the <name>Bar</name>, this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fortress of despotic power, fell prostrate to the cause of Southern Independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/> At about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> the flames appeared to be abating, and it was apprehended that no irreparable injury had been sustained; but near <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> a column of white smoke rose high above the battlements, followed by an explosion which was felt upon the wharves, and gave the assurance that if the magazines were not exploded, at least their temporary ammunition were exposed to the element still raging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Soon after the barracks to the <name>east</name> and <name>west</name> were in flames, the smoke rose in redoubled volume from the whole circle of the fort, and rolling from the embrasures, it seemed scarcely possible that life could be sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Soon after another column of smoke arose as fearful as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>The guns had long been completely silenced, and the only option left to the tenants of the fortress seemed to be whether they would perish or surrender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/> At <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, the staff, from which the flag still waved, was shot away, and it was long in doubt whether, if there were the purpose, there was the ability to reerect it. But at the expiration of about <measure n="20minutes" type="date">20 minutes</measure>, it again appeared upon the eastern rampart, and announced that resistance was not ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>In the mean time, however, a small boat started from the city wharf, bearing <persName n="Lee,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonels</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Pryor,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="mostcommon:Pryor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel"></roleName><surname>Pryor</surname></persName> and <persName n="Miles,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="nearbymention:Miles,W.,Porcher,,"><roleName n="Colonel"></roleName><surname>Miles</surname></persName>, Aids to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, with offers of assistance, if perchance the garrison should be unable to escape the names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>As they approached the fort the flag appeared, and, as the firing from our butteries was unabated, they started to return, and had progressed, perhaps, the larger portion of the way, when a shout arose from the whole circle of spectators on the islands and the main land, announcing that the white flag of truce was waving from the ramparts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>A small boat had already been seen to shoot out from <placeName reg="Cummings Point, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2271638">Cummings' Point</placeName>, in the direction of the fort, in which stood an officer with a white flag upon the point of his sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>This officer proved to be <persName n="Wigtall,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00371" reg="mostcommon:Wigtall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Wigtall</surname></persName>, aid to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs>, who, entering through a port hole, demanded the surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>The boat, with other Aids from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, had returned, and, receiving <persName n="Wigfall,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="mostcommon:Wigfall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Wigfall</surname></persName>, they all came over to the city; and thus was inaugurated the closing act in the military drama. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The Courier gives the following account of <persName n="Wigfall,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Wigfall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Wigfall</surname></persName>'s landing at the fort: </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> <cit><q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The only way to account for the fact is in the excellent protection offered by the unparalleled good works behind which the engagement was fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>The long range of shooting must also be taken into account.
