<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> The war continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Since the last annual message, all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained, and our armies have steadily advanced, thus liberating the regions left in the rear; so that <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 4898" reg="missouri">Missouri, Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and parts of other States, have again produced reasonably fair crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our general-in-chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy and yet to detach a well-appointed large army to move on such an expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> On careful consideration of all the evidence accessible, it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>His declarations to that effect are explicit and oft- repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Either way it would be the victory and defeat following war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Although he cannot re-accept the <rs>Union</rs>, they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and re-union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The number of such may increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>They can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>After so much, the <rs>Government</rs> could not, if it would, maintain war against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The loyal people would not sustain or allow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts and votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Operating only in constitutional and lawful channels, some certain and other possible questions are, and would be, beyond the executive power to adjust, as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress and whatever might require the appropriation of money. --The executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of forfeiture would still be within executive control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged by the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>A year ago, general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered to all, except certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>During the year many availed themselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>During the same time, also, special pardons have been granted to individuals of excepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Thus, practically, the door has been for a full year open to all, except such as were not in condition to make free choice &mdash; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>It is still so open to all; but the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be closed, and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> Among the examples which history affords of a long and desperate struggle between power on the <num value="1">one</num> hand and resolution on the other, the <name>Isthmus</name> of the <name>Caucasus</name> presents a striking illustration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> Let us look, for our instruction and encouragement, in the present contest, to the respective strength and condition of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> and the inhabitants of the <name>Caucasian</name> isthmus at the beginning of their protracted struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>From the time of <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>, the acquisition of that region and the subjugation of its inhabitants never ceased to enlist the profound attention of the <rs>Russian Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The only pretext of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> for the war upon Circassia was that, by virtue of the treaty of <placeName key="tgn,7002317" n="1.000 10" reg="Edirne,Edirne,Marmara,Turkiye,Asia">Adrianople</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName> had placed Circassia under the dominion of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, whereas <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName> herself never had, nor claimed to have, rights over the <name>Circassians</name> or their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>We are not discussing the question of right, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It is might which too often makes right in this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It was a stern political necessity for <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> to obtain Circassia, as the key to all her projected military enterprises in the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Any pretext would be sufficient for a war having that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Her strength was such as the most powerful nation might be reluctant to encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Alone, of all other States, she, from the time of <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName>, had encountered no reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>She had successively swallowed up empire after empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Enormous hordes of men furnished recruits to the <name>Muscovite</name> standards; and it is a race which doubles in every half- century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>On the other side were the tribes of the <name>Caucasus</name>, numbering a population of only <num value="3000000">three millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The world looked upon these mountaineers as simply barbarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>What, then, is the history of a war waged on <num value="1">one</num> side by the most colossal of modern empires, and conducted by her best generals, and on the other by a mere handful of rude mountaineers, destitute of all means of resistance save those supplied by their own courage and ingenuity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>That war has lasted nearly <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure>, and the sturdy spirit of Circassia is still unsubdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Admitting that <num value="7000000">seven millions</num> of civilized and heroic <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo-Saxons</rs>, abundantly supplied with weapons of war, and possessing within themselves resources of inventive skill and agricultural and mineral resources unknown to the <name>Caucasus</name>, cannot do better than the rude and imperfectly armed <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of Circassians, the <rs>North</rs> may look forward to <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> of bloody war before it can approach the subjugation of this country, instead of the <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> which <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> promised them <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> Nor was this ill success of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> occasioned by any undue economy of her military resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>She has never been frugal of human life nor of the material of war. Her annual loss in this invasion has been estimated at <num value="15000">15,000</num> out of <num value="80000">80,000</num> men.--The Army of the <name>Caucasus</name> required to be renewed once in every <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>. In <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> she lost <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men and officers, which is nothing to the <rs>Northern</rs> loss in <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, taking Northern accounts as our basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s loss in a single battle is often as great as that of the <rs>Russian Army</rs> of the <name>Caucasus</name> in a whole year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>If the <rs>North</rs> does not feel the drain of her population, still less did <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The men sent to her army were, for the most part, men who had already been doomed to destruction; the insubordinate, the suspected, and the poor Poles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The army was, moreover, mostly supported by the <rs>Southern</rs> provinces in a manner not felt by the empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The <rs>North</rs>, which is not <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> in anything but barbarism, already is losing her supply of foreign soldiers, and is also compelled to support from her own treasury the enormous expense of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> Nor did <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> lack the ferocity to carry on such a war to a successful consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is true that, not till after <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> of battle, of murder and desolation, a project of exterminating the <name>Circassians</name> was seriously proposed in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>That project has been seriously proposed in the <rs>North</rs> before <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of our war have expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But the <name>Russians</name>, after all, are men, not demons, and, compared with the rest of mankind, (among whom it is impossible to class <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> exterminators,) her conduct in attempting to exterminate a whole race was as atrocious as it proved impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It deserves to be remarked, as exhibiting a parallel in <num value="1">one</num> respect to what we have seen in the <rs>North</rs>, that <num value="2">two</num> plans were proposed to the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> by <num value="2">two</num> opposite parties; <num value="1">one</num> of a mild, the other of a very opposite character. &#x0022;The former party,&#x0022; says a narrator of these events, &#x0022;lamenting the enormous waste of blood and treasure to the empire, and referring to long experience in support of their opinion that conquest by force was hopeless, counselled measures of conciliation, and a renewal of former (though at those times ineffectual) attempts at establishing commercial relations with the country, in order to humanize the <name>Circassians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>They admitted the necessity of a blockade and the exclusion of foreign interference; for their object, like that of the other parties, was not the happiness of the <name>Circassians</name> so much as their subjugation and the aggrandizement of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>They therefore proposed the maintenance of some forts on the coast, but in other respects suggested mild measures, a free bestowal of favors and benefits, with the further temptation of honors and personal advantages to individuals; all of which, they conceived, might in time reconcile these mountaineers to regard <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> as their sovereign and superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The proposals of the other party, on the contrary, were conceived in the spirit of the most uncompromising severity, and breathed nothing but fire and sword.&#x0022; The latter project was adopted; and <persName n="Williameenoff,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Williameenoff,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Williameenoff</surname></persName>, who proposed it, was entrusted with its execution, pledging himself to reduce Circassia by his plan within <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>. This was <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago. The only effect was the exasperation of the <name>Circassians</name> to the most intense hatred, strengthened by desperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Hitherto the defensive of the <name>Caucasus</name> had been weakened by fends, family quarrels, claims of individual and personal interest, and the separate action of disunited tribes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Now they resolved to bury forever all private passions and interests, and a convocation of princes and chiefs of clans was summoned, who formed a confederation, every member of which bound himself, by the most sacred oaths, to maintain the liberty of his country against <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> aggression with his best blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>A solemn interdict was placed on all intercourse with the enemy, even for salt and other necessaries, under pain of the most signal punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Even families which had received benefits from their foes were forced to join the league; and, as a proof of their determination, the whole property of an invalid, who had gone for medical assistance, was committed to the flames.--Such is the only spirit which threats of extermination arouse in the breasts of a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>In the <num value="2">two</num> campaigns that followed, Williameenoff, the <name>Exterminator</name>, was himself very nearly exterminated without having gained <num value="1">one</num> important point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The world soon became convinced that the idea of subduing a free people, by means so revolting, was as absurd as it was inhuman. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> Like ourselves, the <name>Circassians</name> were environed by a blockade, which not only rendered it difficult to obtain arms, but even salt, which they could not produce; and, like us, they had no friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/><placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, bound to them by so many ties of blood, turned a deaf ear to their invocations for assistance, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, whose vital interest it was to thwart the designs of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> upon the <rs>East</rs> rigidly maintained her stupid and cold-blooded non-intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Yet, in spite of all these discouragements, Circassia has successfully resisted the enormous odds of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> for nearly <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure>, and the spirit of her people is still unbroken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> Can we not do as well?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If we can do no better, if after <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> we must fail, what will the <rs>North</rs> gain to remunerate its blood and treasure?--In the choice vernacular of that people, we ask emphatically, &#x0022;will it pay?&#x0022; What will be the prospects of cotton and tobacco after <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/><placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, when she gains the <name>Caucasus</name>, has her reward in the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The <rs>North</rs>, when it gains the <rs>South</rs>, has her reward in a desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Even vengeance will be disappointed, for its original objects will long ere then have passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>And with them &mdash; rejoice, oh delivered humanity &mdash; <orgName><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName> will have gone to their final account.
