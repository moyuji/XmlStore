<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They have been tested in the fiery furnace, <num value="7">seven</num> times heated, of a war which, in its ferocity, duration and magnitude, has few parallels in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> contest of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution was child's play compared with this struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It s largest armies would have scarcely formed an advance guard of the giant hosts which have been marshalled in this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Its most formidable weapons were pop guns to the huge missiles which have hurtled through the air in this Titanic struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We do no wrong to the memory of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, nor to the facts of history, when we say that he never gave such proof of military ability as <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lee,N.,M.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>--a soldier who, with limited means, has successfully resisted for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> the enormous power of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and kept the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag flying defiant on the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> We need say nothing to inspire confidence in such a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But perhaps we ought to say something to prevent that confidence from becoming idolatry; to invoke the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> not to put their trust in man, whose breath is in his nostrils, but to place their only reliance upon that Divine hand which controls the destinies of nations, and which has hitherto been interposed so wonderfully in our behalf; that <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who is a jealous <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and who will not permit his subjects to transfer with impunity the glory of the <name>Creator</name> to his creatures and his instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have made prodigious efforts, endured terrible sufferings, and made the most heroic sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The unskillful and improvident management of their resources by some of the officials of the <rs>Government</rs> have been well calculated to dampen their ardor, and the harsh and factious criticisms of newspapers to sow the seeds of distrust and despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But a better era in the management of affairs has dawned; and if the press, people and Government will work in harmony, and the spirit of greed and extortion can, in any way, be banished, we shall see brighter days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We cannot afford to quarrel with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If we can make <num value="1">one</num> more united effort, the day will be our own.--If we prefer subjugation to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to a longer continuance of resistance &mdash; to fly from our present evils to others that we know not of &mdash; it is easy to make the experiment.
