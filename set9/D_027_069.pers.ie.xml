<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The demand is an ignominious confession of failure, but it proves that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is still his object, and that he hopes still to accomplish it. Could he do so, no matter at what cost, it would clear up his somewhat clouded fame; and although accomplished with enormously disproportionate forces, and at an enormous sacrifice of life, would raise him to the very pinnacle of greatness among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The reversion of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s slippers &mdash; that is to say, if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> does not choose to exchange them for a pair of military boots &mdash; would certainly be his. In the distracted state of Yankeedom he might even look higher than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>A crown and sceptre might be the reward of such an exploit, and <persName><foreName>Ulysses</foreName> <genName n="1">I</genName></persName>. might sign himself <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">Emperor</rs> of all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Add to this, that the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is, next to a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> term, the great object of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s ambition, and that it would secure his re-election beyond the reach of peradventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Put all these things together &mdash; the fortification of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, the <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> truce, the continual movement of troops up the river, the ambition of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and the mania of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> upon this subject, --and if any man be not convinced that a tremendous onslaught is impending over <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> he must be harder of belief than <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, who was surnamed <persName n="Didymus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Didymus,nomatch:0"><surname>Didymus</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> To us, at least, it is perfectly plain that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> imagine the rebellion to be in such a condition that it can be destroyed at a single blow, and <sic>that that</sic> blow must fall upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>For our own part we do not believe that the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would put an end to the &#x0022;rebellion.&#x0022; Yet we are free to confess that it is by far the most important point in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, morally as well as strategically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Its capture would go farther to dishearten our people than all other causes put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>In the meantime, if we can withstand this desperate effort, there is every reason to believe that it will be the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>And yet on that very account it will be the more desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Our authorities, beyond all doubt, see the matter as we do, for, indeed, there is no other light in which to view it. The capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would transfer the whole <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> into the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines, and within those lines they would then include all the country that lies between this and the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It would be time enough then to continue operation upon the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States, if, indeed, those States continued their opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Such being the state of the case, we are confident that every effort will be made to prevent the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from getting possession of it; nor do we believe that they will succeed in doing so. We have powerful resources for defence within our reach, and, doubtless, they will be employed to the best advantage. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> The State must have the services of her able-bodied men, and delinquents must be brought back to their duty, or those neglecting to arrest them must take their places.
