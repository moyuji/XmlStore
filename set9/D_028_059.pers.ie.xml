<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> We learn from the <name>Scriptures</name> that there is <num value="1">one</num> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, from, of and to whom are all things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In other words, &#x0022;By Him were all things created that are in Heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible; whether they be thrones or dominions, principalities or powers; all things were created by Him and for Him.&#x0022; No event can possibly occur, from the launching of a planet into space, to the falling of a sparrow to the earth, without being under His especial guidance and control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It needs but little reflection to infer that everything is created for <hi rend="italics">a purpose,</hi> and that nothing whatever is left to the dominion of Chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The purpose in question, too, is a moral purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The whole universe, animate as well as inanimate, is designed to answer some great moral end, and the <name>Scriptures</name> tell us what it is. It is to display, in as clear a light as possible, the perfections of the <name>Divine</name> nature. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Perfect goodness and immutable justice are among the attributes of the <name>Divinity</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The blood of the <rs>Lord Jesus Christ</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="IsFather">Son of</rs> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who died to save a world lying under condemnation from utter destruction, vindicated the honor of the broken law. This Saviour was announced at the time of <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName>'s fall, <measure n="4000years" type="date">four thousand years</measure> before his appearance on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>From the <name>Scriptures</name> we learn that various means have been adopted, at different times, to warn the world that it lay under condemnation for sin. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> As the universe was for a great moral purpose, to wit, the more perfect display of the <name>Divine</name> attributes, every event that occurs in it is to be viewed in connection with this Holy Law, established by the <name>Creator</name> himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Man is in a state of sin in this world, and all he undergoes &mdash; sickness, labor cold, hunger, thirst, death, everything from which unhappiness proceeds &mdash; is a punishment for sin. They are rendered, indeed, essentially necessary as a means of discipline, and of chastening the mind and purging it of the passions destructive of man's temporal happiness, and so inimical to his eternal welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>With regard to aggregations of individuals,--that is, communities and States, or nations,--there can be no doubt that they are governed by the same external principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Sin lies at the bottom of all the sorrows of this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Were there no sin there would be no plague, famine or war; there would be no earthquakes or ships wrecks; there would be no tornadoes or tempests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In the present war, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is assuredly punishing us for our transgressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The doctrine is everywhere announced in the <name>Scriptures</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There is, indeed, none other more distinctly laid down; and the examples under the rule are almost unlimited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We have sinned, and we have sinned grievously, and it is because we have so sinned that the hand of the <rs>Lord</rs> is laid so heavily upon us at this moment, and that reverses and disasters have followed each other with such startling rapidity of late.--That we will continue to sustain reverses and disasters until the whole people shall have repented of their sins in sackcloth and ashes we may be as well assured of as we can be of any truth contained in the writings of the <name>Evangelists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It by no means follows that He favors our enemies in opposition to us. Sometimes &mdash; nay, very often,--when He designs that an enterprise shall succeed in the end, He punishes <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> those whom he designs to succeed in the end by temporary failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There are many instances to prove this fact in Scripture, but <num value="1">one</num> will suffice.--<persName><foreName>Joshua</foreName></persName> was not only a good and great man, but he was inspired, and acted immediately under the direction of Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He had been especially assigned to the duty of extirpating the <name>Heathen</name> from the land of <placeName reg="Canaan, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063278">Canaan</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>An expedition which he sent against the town of <placeName reg="Ar">Ar</placeName> was repulsed, and he immediately saw that some great sin had been committed, which had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>What it was, he knew not; but he inquired of Heaven by prayer and sacrifice, and was thereby enabled to discover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He learned that Achan, the <persName n="Carmi,IsFather,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Carmi,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsFather">son of</roleName> <surname>Carmi</surname></persName>, had partaken of the accursed thing, and he punished the offence by cutting him off, with all his descendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This expiation made, he proceeded to cancel the land and divide it out according to the <name>Divine</name> command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> This day it is expected that this whole Confederacy will prostrate itself in prayer at the footstool of Omnipotence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Let the proclamation be strictly obeyed in that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Let <hi rend="italics">all</hi> do it. Let them pour out their hearts to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and repent of their sins in sackcloth and ashes, if they expect His favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It will not do merely to fast and go to church, returning to their old habits the next day. They must repent, and show that they do repent by changing their courses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The preachers, we hope and believe, will do their duty everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Let them denounce sin everywhere, open or concealed, in the strongest and most direct terms they can think of. This is no time to be nice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Let them preach until every man thinks the <name>Devil</name> has gotten into his pew, and is chasing him up to a corner of it. Let them tell the people plainly what is the matter, that their cause does not prosper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Let them, above all other things, lay bare the great National sin of money getting that has fallen upon all classes like a leprosy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> But enough of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Our people may rest assured that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> cannot be propitiated by unclean hands and impure lips. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The performance of <persName n="Cain,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Cain,nomatch:0"><surname>Cain</surname></persName> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> infancy of the art, and a good many modern murders are quite as deficient in taste, finish and scenical grouping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This connoisseur of homicide admits that murder is a dangerous, as well as difficult branch, and that &#x0022;if a man once indulges in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Many a man has dated his ruin from some murder that perhaps he thought little of at the time.&#x0022; He tells of a brother connoisseur who had become gloomy and misanthropically over the cleaver and paving stone character of modern murders, and looked upon the <rs>French Revolution</rs> as the great cause of degeneration in the science. &#x0022;Very soon, sir,&#x0022; he used to say, &#x0022;men will have lost the art of killing poultry; the very rudiments of the art will have perished.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> We submit to the profession in the <rs>North</rs> whether there is not some danger of bringing a noble service into disrepute by the wholesale style in which it is now practiced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In former times, the public taste required a superb <hi rend="italics">chef&#x00E6;d' uvre,</hi> like that of the <name>Burdell</name> assassination, and turned up its nose at more blood-shedding, unaccompanied by any exhibitions of genius or study, as vicious and vulgar abortions, unworthy the attention of a civilized community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But now, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>nothing satisfies it but the hanging, or shooting, or putting to death in some form or other, without any regard to the proprieties of Confederate victims. &#x0022;<num value="15">Fifteen</num> guerrillas&#x0022; taken out and shot is the kind of reading that gives spice to a morning newspaper.-- &#x0022;<num value="5">Five</num> Confederates&#x0022; to be hung for every Union man killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commanders</rs>, who have a prompt, off-hand way of sending helpless mortals out of the world, are the most popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The only appetite to be consulted is killing, without discrimination, taste, or anything like science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Corpses of alleged <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> spies, guerrillas and other monsters, must be supplied at the shortest notice for breakfast, dinner and supper, and &#x0022;Thugdom, in all its branches,&#x0022; is the toast of the day. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> The Northern journals and orators have lavished a great variety of affectionate epithets in describing the relationship between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.--Each of these epithets is significant of kinship, for, wicked, perverse and infernal as we are, we are still &#x0022;estranged brethren,&#x0022; or &#x0022;wayward sisters,&#x0022; or &#x0022;rebellious children,&#x0022; or, climax of amatory rhetoric, the <rs>Northern States</rs> are the bridegroom, and the <rs>Southern</rs> the bride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>This symbol of wedlock is the favorite mode of looking at the thing from a Northern point of observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The bride,--refractory and false, of course, --but still the bride, who promised to &#x0022;love, honor and obey,&#x0022; and said at the altar, &#x0022;With all my worldly goods I thee endow!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Nothing in history, in poetry, or in fable, equals the devotion of the <rs>Northern</rs> bridegroom to the false Southern bride, except the inexhaustible assiduity of <persName n="Menelaus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Menelaus,nomatch:0"><surname>Menelaus</surname></persName> to <persName><foreName>Helen</foreName></persName> after <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> had run away with his incomparable spouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>But <persName><foreName>Helen</foreName></persName>, with all her faults, was the animating soul of a great epic, and we do not wonder at the bewildered husband walking his deserted halls and feeding his love by gazing upon the many statues of his truant flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>But here the parallel comes to a halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>If <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> had contented himself with the moral suasion of <persName><foreName>Helen</foreName></persName>'s husband, the peerless bride might longer this have been back in his loving arms. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In it you state that it has been officially reported that your foraging parties were &#x0022;murdered&#x0022; after capture; and you go on to say that you had &#x0022;ordered a similar number of prisoners in your hands to be disposed of in like manner.&#x0022; That is to say, you have ordered a number of Confederate soldiers to be &#x0022;murdered.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> You characterize your order in proper terms; for the public voice, even in your own country, where it seldom dares to express itself in vindication of truth, honor or justice, will surely agree with you in pronouncing you guilty of murder if your order is carried out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> Before dismissing this portion of your letter, I beg to assure you for every soldier of mine &#x0022;murdered&#x0022; by you I shall have executed at once <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> of yours, giving, in all cases, preference to any officers who may be in my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/><milestone unit="column" n="5"/> In reference to the statement you make regarding the death of your foragers, I have only to say that I know nothing of it; that no orders given by me authorize the killing of prisoners after capture, and that I do not believe that my men killed any of your except under circumstances in which it was perfectly legitimate and proper they should kill them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> It is a part of the system of the thieves whom you designate as your foragers to fire the dwellings of those <sic>citizens</sic> whom they have robbed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> To check this inhuman system, which is justly execrated by every civilized nation, I have directed my men to shoot down all of your men who are caught burning houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>This order shall remain in force as long as you disgrace the profession of arms by allowing your men to destroy private dwellings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> You say that I cannot, of course, question your right to forage on the country. &#x0022;It is a right as old as history.&#x0022; I do not, sir, question this right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>But there is a right older even than this, and <num value="1">one</num> more inalienable &mdash; the right that every man has to defend his home and to protect those who are dependent upon him. And from my heart I wish that every old man and boy in my country who can fire a gun would shoot down, as he would a wild beast, the men who are desolating their land, burning their houses, and insulting their women. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> You are particular in defining and claiming &#x0022;war rights.&#x0022; <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> I ask if you enumerate among them the right to fire upon a defenceless city without notice; to burn that city to the ground after it had been surrendered by the authorities, who claimed, though in vain, that protection which is always accorded in civilized warfare to non-combatants; to fire the dwelling-houses of citizens after robbing them, and to perpetrate even darker crimes than these &mdash; crimes too black to be mentioned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> You have permitted, if you have not ordered, the commission of these offences against humanity and the rules of war. You fired into the city of <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> without a word of warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>After its surrender by the <rs>Mayor</rs>, who demanded protection to private property, you laid the whole city in ashes, leaving amid its ruins <num value="1000">thousands</num> of old men and helpless women and children, who are likely to perish of starvation and exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Your line of march can be traced by the lurid light of burning houses, and in more than <num value="1">one</num> household there is an agony far more bitter than that of death. </p>
