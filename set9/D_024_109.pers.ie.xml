<head>The last victory</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We have a few more details this morning of the resent victory on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.--The mar&#x0153;avres and achievements of our army during the powerful contest are of the most brilliant character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The enemy, in his own efforts to retrieve his fortunes, has added immensely to the splendor of the triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>To <persName n="Sedgwick,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of their ablest and most accomplished commanders, was assigned the task of assailing the rear of our army with a large force of fresh troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They gained some advantages over our command at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>; but were afterwards repulsed, and by a prompt and rapid movement by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lee,F.,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> were routed and forced to retreat rapidly across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, under cover of their guns on its north bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> are amongst the most brilliant in the annals of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, already illumined with triumphs which, for number and magnitude, are not surpassed in history. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> This terrible defeat is a sad finale for the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army whose terms of service were on the eve of expiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> could not afford to wait till they were at liberty to leave him. He felt the necessity of bringing all the men he could against the brave <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lee,F.,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName>, and they were led to slaughter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> So far as his reputation is concerned, <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> might well envy the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He obtained command of the army he has led to defeat by defaming his brother officers and the assiduous obtrusion of his own conceits of strategy on the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He was gratified with the chance of winning renown by retrieving the fortunes of the oft-defeated Federal <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He has met a well merited fate, and must now go to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Hades of all defeated <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> What our enemies propose next, and how long they will extend the time for the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we shall perhaps soon learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They have displayed great perseverance in this object so dear to them, and may not be willing yet to abandon it. It is probable that <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> will be the next star in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Let us hope, however, that there will be time to sink him below the horizon before the new &#x0022; On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022; can be planned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The blow on the <rs>Potomac</rs> will be salutary in its effects upon the enemy and upon our own men. It will cheer ours as much as it will depress his, and give tone to the summer campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If it does the situation of affairs will undergo a great improvement, both at home and abroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The glorious <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> merits the lasting gratitude of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It has won a renown equal to that of any army the world ever saw. </p> </div3>

<head>The Federal raid.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> We give such additional information as has come to hand with reference to this bold raid into the heart of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The only consolation left us to extract from the affair is that the raid makers succeeded in doing so little injury to our <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Nor did they inflict much injury on private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Their means of conveyance and time did not allow them to gratify their fondness for pillage to any great degree. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Whether they have all gotten off or not we are not as yet informed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They came into <placeName reg="Louisa, Louisa, Virginia" key="tgn,2112748">Louisa</placeName> and separated into <num value="2">two</num> or more bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>That <num value="1">one</num> which came to <placeName reg="Ashland, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2110477">Ashland</placeName>, injuring the <rs type="place">Central Road</rs> in its route, has certainly gone off rapidly to <placeName reg="Gloucester Point, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111953">Gloucester Point</placeName>, after only a skirmish at <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">Tunstall's Station</placeName> with the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA44">44th Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>That division which started for <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, and was probably commanded by <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName> himself, was in the region bordering on the canal as late as <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>noon</time>.--What has become of them we have not yet learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It was stated that <persName n="Lee,General,F.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="expanded:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had driven them from <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, and saved the aqueduct over the <rs>Rivanna</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But if ever driven from thence they returned and made an attempt to destroy it, as will be seen in our news column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Fortunately the effort failed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> How many men were in the expedition there is no means at hand of ascertaining satisfactorily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Conjecture has the number from <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure> to <num value="10000">10,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The affair was planned well, but badly executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It was the fault of the raiders, for little opposition was in their route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They had it all their own way. They have, without doing much harm, put a great affront upon us, and, we apprehend, have gone home to boast of it. They gave a fine opportunity for aspirants for military fame, but nobody embraced it. We believe no <num value="1">one</num> will likely ever be promoted for his part in the war of <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>'s raid. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The seizure of the <rs>Alexandria</rs> in <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> by Government authority is <num value="1">one</num> thing, and her condemnation after trial is quite another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The trial of the question as to her destination will no doubt be a fair <num value="1">one</num>, and as the onus of proof in <name>English</name> law rests upon the prosecution, it will be no easy matter to convict the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The prying <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, looking into all the ship- yards of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, behold in every vessel that is on the stocks a &#x0022;<num value="290">290</num>.&#x0022; They have awful forebodings of the havoc each will play with their commerce on the seas, and they endeavor, by appeals and threats, to induce the <rs>British Government</rs> to intercept them, disappoint the rebels, and protect their commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The British Government, recognizing its obligations under the law of nations, is instituting inquiry touching the suspected vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>How it will result remains to be seen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> Yankeedom, with all its superior numbers and its immense naval force, embracing the entire old navy, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the cost of which was paid by the <rs>Southern States</rs>, is not satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Not a keel can be laid in the ship-yards of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> without attracting the notice and prompting the prying inquiries of some long noses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The British Government has no rest from their suspicions and their demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Yet they are shipping from the <rs>British</rs> ports, with out limit or hindrance, every sort of appliance of war. Just about the time of the rupture from the arrest of our Ministers on the <name n="United Kingdom">English</name> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Trent</rs>, they had bought all the saltpetre in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, in order to forestall the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and deprive it of the means of making powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, fearing a war with them, interdicted its exportation, but withdrew the interdiction as soon as the matter was settled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Not only are they getting aid in this way from the nation they seek to force to deny us everything, but they are enlisting men in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> to come over and fight the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Their emissaries are all over that country, deluding the poor <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> with every sort of promise and cunning scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Among the latter is the project of the liberation of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> after the <rs>South</rs> is crushed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>as if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> would incur danger or expense for anything on earth but his own benefit and emolument!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>No people could exhibit a greater indignation than did the men of the <rs>North</rs> at the attempt of the <rs>British</rs> agents to enlist men in this country for the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> Crimean war. Nothing appeased their wrath until the enterprise was abandoned, and the <rs>British Government</rs> had disclaimed the right to undertake it. Now behold them following the example they denounced as outrageous!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But they are more cunning than the <rs>English</rs>, and it will be no easy matter to detect them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> It is amusing to us, since we know the real motives and policy of <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName>, to see how he is perplexed by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Indeed, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> stick to <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> not unlike the gout.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> The next foreign news from across the <rs>Atlantic</rs> is looked for, of course, with much interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>There is a general desire to know how <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> will relish the impudent and high handed act of <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=43">Adams, U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The pass is, of course, an insult to all nations who have a commerce on the seas; for it is an assumption of a right to exercise a surveillance over a neutral port, and to pass or arrest vessels going thither as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities may deem proper.--Yet, more than to others, is it a direct offence to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, inasmuch as the pass gave uninterrupted transit through the blockade of the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> to a vessel freighted with arms and ammunition to be used by the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexicans</rs> in their war with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The mere act is pointed enough in itself; but if it were not, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Minister makes it so, according to the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, by declaring that he granted the pass &#x0022;on account of the <hi rend="italics">creditable object in view.</hi>&#x0022; Impertinent as the act war, and insolent as it was, to all the commercial nations, this explanation makes it peculiarly irritating to the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> I need not say that the desire of the <rs>Government</rs> is that prisoners of war shall be treated with all the kindness which a proper human feeling prompts, and which is consistent with their position; for it is a well known fact that clothing and blankets have been issued to the many destitute who have fallen into our hands; the sick and wounded have been as well and as promptly attended to as our own soldiers, and all have been furnished with an abundant supply of rations, even including what may well be called luxuries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> But if I am rightly informed it has been by no means so with our troops when they have been captured, as he may learn by inquiring when he reaches <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>So far from receiving clothing, it has frequently happened that they have been stripped of all their outer garments, and then crowded into prisons inconceivably filthy, so much so it would be shocking to humanity to confine in such a place even the most abandoned of criminals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>There, too, were confined men of all ranks, from <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to privates, and all alike experienced the most insulting indignities and most unwarrantable harshness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> As far as I have learned, this has been the almost invaluable treatment of our citizens and soldiers who have been held as prisoners of war at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and there is scarcely room to doubt that it has been done by authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> In this brief view of the case, you will say then, to <persName n="Churchill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="nearbymention:Churchill,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Churchill</surname></persName>, that though the indignities and outrages of which he complains are not only wholly unauthorized but are in violation of the instructions which have been given to govern in such cases, yet the course pursued as it appears by his Government in similar cases takes from him all shadow of grounds for complaint. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> He has been made to suffer by an unauthorized retaliation for innumerable outrages which have been committed on our people, if not by authority of his Government, at least in its immediate presence, and which have given rise to the bitter feelings he so much deprecates. </p>
