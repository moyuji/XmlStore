<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be hold by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Those who think to retain arms for their own defence should remember that if the army cannot protect them the arms will be of little use.--While no valid title can be acquired to public arms and equipments, except from the <rs>Government</rs>, it is reported that many persons have ignorantly purchased them from private parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer command in at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Niter and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>All these officers are requested, and those connected with this army are directed, to receive and receipt for all arms and equipments, whatever their condition, and forward the same, with a duplicate receipt, to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and report their proceedings to these headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The person holding the receipt will be compensated upon presenting it to the <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> While it is hoped that no <num value="1">one</num> will disregard this appeal, all officers connected with this army are required, and all others are requested, to take possession of any public arms and equipments they may find in the hands of persons unwilling to surrender them to the service of the country, and to give receipt therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A prompt compliance with the call will greatly promote the efficiency and strength of the army, particularly of the cavalry, and render it better able to protect the homes and property of the people from outrage. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Lee,,R.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Lee,R.,E.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName>  <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, General.</signed> </closer> </div4>

He stood almost alone at the beginning of the war in his appreciation of the magnitude and duration of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Nevertheless, he calmly girded his loins for the unequal contest, and, on his broad Titanic shoulders, has borne with majestic strength and dignity the military fortunes of the <rs>Republic</rs>. --Through this tremendous struggle he has never faltered, never shown signs of weakness nor despondency, never done a rash act nor uttered a rash word.--Such an image of quiet power, of self-sustained energy, of invincible composure, of moderation in prosperity and dignity in adversity, has not been seen on this continent since the days of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Will Congress heed the voice of this man, whose sagacity predicted the fearful odds we should have to encounter in this war, whose military skill has enabled us, thus far, to meet those odds successfully, and to whose hands it has just intrusted the supreme command?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It requires no prophet to foresee that, unless his counsels are heeded, the negroes whom we will not put into our own army will be forced into that of the enemy, adding to the accumulating amount of force which we are resisting with diminished resources, and rendering the future contest a struggle of despair.
