<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>We are a party of refugees, whose favorite amusement is to drive down to battalion drill and dress parade towards sunset, and afterwards to take tea in the different tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>You would be amused to see the unique entertainments to which we have several times been invited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>In the charity of my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>I only wish that some of the other girls in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> could participate in these festivities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>I must say, however, in justice to the amateur <rs>Soyers</rs>, that the bread, etc., which I have seen on such occasions was quite worthy of the kitchen of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate <placeName reg="Virginia house">Virginia house</placeName>-wife, while the profusion with which we were entertained was only equalled by the cordiality of our reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It is utterly impossible not to be cheered by the beaming faces we meet on every side, or not to be infected by the general spirit of confidence and certainty of success which animates our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>There is something so irresistibly attractive, too, in being arrested at every turn by a severe-looking sentinel, with his bayonet pointed in <num value="1">one</num>'s face, and in having to be escorted out of camp after night by <q>&#x0022;a friend with the countersign!&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> In every paper we see appeals made for financial aid from our Government, now in the time of its greatest strait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>That to the cotton planters is being answered nobly, but can hardly be available at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>In almost every house there is what could be converted immediately into money to meet the wants of our country &mdash; I mean its silver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Is there <num value="1">one</num> that <hi rend="italics">can,</hi> under these circumstances, withhold aught that he or she can give?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>I do not propose that the silver be a gift, but a loan to the <rs>Government</rs>, (because many that would wish to could not afford that,) and that each <num value="1">one</num> receive its full value in Confederate bonds; and I think if the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> would appoint agents and call upon the people, he would find them ready to give to their utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>A great sacrifice we know it will be, for with all household silver is attached a <num value="1000">thousand</num> recollections and heart-stirring memories, which, to its possessor, enhances its value beyond price; but if, for your ancestor's sake, you hesitate, remember you are but following their example in laying it on the altar of your country, (the greater the sacrifice, the more noble and blessed the gift;) if for your children, think it is to purchase for them the best of earthly blessings, <hi rend="italics">Freedom.</hi> For we know that our all is on this issue, and that, if this <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> goes down, <hi rend="italics">we all go down,</hi> and that property and even life, outside of its success, <hi rend="italics">is nothing.</hi> There is yet <num value="1">one</num> other motive which I would place before you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Fellow-countrymen, it is for these gallant spirits that our Government calls upon us to arm, to clothe and to feed them, and to find them necessaries in times of sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Will you refuse?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>No; I cannot believe it. Let those who are wealthy and can give otherwise of their abundance, still make the sacrifice for the moral influence it may have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>A <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> people, whose liberties were won by a rebellion, whose independence was achieved by a secession, parrot as glibly as any minions of old-world tyranny <q>&#x0022;the rebels&#x0022;</q> and the <q>&#x0022;rebellion&#x0022;</q> as phrases of odium and reproach !

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> If what is now passing in <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> took place in any of the old-world empires, it would be at least intelligible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Have we not been told, as the <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> principle, that the subjects of a State themselves, and no <num value="1">one</num> else, are to be judges whether they have provocation, justification on right? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> Yet, let us consider that the case of the <rs>South</rs>, as regards its right to secede, is far stronger than was that of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies to rebel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Under the old monarchical systems no such right was ever tolerated &mdash; no such principle ever heard of &mdash; as <q>&#x0022;the voice of the population&#x0022;</q> determining the justice, legitimacy or duration of a Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies originated under that monarchical system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>They had never claimed or possessed the attributes of <q>&#x0022;Independent Sovereign States,&#x0022;</q> nor had their connection with the <rs>English</rs> crown originated in a compact having for its object mutual benefit and defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>What, on the other hand, is the position of the <rs>Southern States</rs> in the present case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>They are not mere colonies, counties, or districts of any State, kingdom or empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>They are a number of <q>&#x0022;Sovereign Independent States;&#x0022;</q> so styled in law and so proved in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Their political system &mdash; the political system of the whole <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>--is based on the fundamental principle of the right of rebellion, determinable by the voice of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>These several independent sovereign States, of their own free choosing and for the purpose of their own and the common welfare, interest, and protection, federate with certain others to this end. A number of these States declare that faith has not been kept with them in the compact of confederation, and that the cause and purpose of their federal association with certain others no longer urge its continuance, but on the contrary demand its termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Whether they possess the right to so terminate the connection, is neither asserted nor denied by the deed of Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>This silence is claimed by each side in the quarrel as favorable to its own case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Upon which side the constriction may be said to weigh, is, no doubt, a nice and intricate question for political doctrinaire and hair-splitting controversialists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>But what we have to say is this, that it is something more than mournful &mdash; it is monstrous, it is an outrage and a disgrace to humanity, that on a point which may be ruled either way, the shocking spectacle must be seen of torrents of blood being made to flow in the conquest &mdash; the subjugation --of those independent States, who merely ask for self-government and freedom to decide their own destinies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>We say it would be deplorable even if those Southern States were mere colonies or outlying districts of a despotic empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We say that, in the face of such a unanimous determination for secession &mdash; right or wrong, according to construction of constitutional technicalities --this bloody war to force Union on the <rs>Southern</rs> people at the point of the sword &mdash; to sabre them into brotherhood and dragoon them into <q>&#x0022;liberty!&#x0022;</q>--is a blot upon humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>We cannot pause to weigh the niceties of the rival constructions of the silence of the deed of Union with reference to the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>We turn in disgust from all this, denying that the proof at best can be plain enough to reconcile us to this butchery &mdash; butchery to be done, let us remember, not by kings, autocrats, or tyrants, but by <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, advocates of popular liberty &mdash; themselves the offspring of rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>We have often enough and clearly enough declared our anxiety that the great Republic of <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> might be saved from dismemberment; but far greater is our anxiety, for the sake of the hideous reproach it involves to popular liberty, that it may be saved from the terrible crime of forcing its Federal embrace upon any State at the expense of ruthless slaughter by fire and sword. </p> </div3>
