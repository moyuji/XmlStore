<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> was advised that, with a heavy force of cavalry and mounted infantry, he was advancing on <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName>, with the supposed intention of pushing his way to the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee Railroad</orgName> with a view of intercepting railroad communication with <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, and yesterday we had a rumor that he was approaching <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> by way of <placeName key="tgn,2112810" n="1.000 32" reg="mcdowell, highland, virginia">McDowell</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This latter report, we are inclined to believe, is without foundation, as the passengers by the <rs>Central</rs> train last night state that little excitement existed at <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is probable that the information received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> more nearly approaches the whereabouts of <persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName> and his commands and he may are this have reached <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>During yesterday active skirmishing took place between their advance guard and our forces in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,2112810" n="1.000 32" reg="mcdowell, highland, virginia">McDowell</placeName>, without any decisive result. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>At last accounts they were in the <rs type="place">Luray Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was believed that this movement was made with the design of destroying the large iron furnaces along the river in that region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The facts, as we have obtained them, with reference to the affair, would seem to indicate a lack of vigilance on the part of our troops at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, an hour after sunrise, the whole of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Robertson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> companies of the <orgName type="regiment" key="42VABattalion">42d Virginia battalion</orgName> of cavalry, were completely surprised, and, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, all the men captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is said that the surprise was so complete as not to admit of resistance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> It was reported here yesterday morning that the enemy had destroyed the village of <placeName reg="Charles City Court-House">Charles City Court-House</placeName>, but later in the day the report was contradicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They did, however, burn <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> buildings in the place. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The reports of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Secretaries</rs> are worth reading as a matter of curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>That of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> is the most interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He starts out with the assertion that the success of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> arms has enabled his Department to make a reduction of <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> in the estimates for the issuing fiscal year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The draft, we learn from him, was only enforced in <num value="12">twelve</num> States, and yielded <num value="50000">50,000</num> men and <measure n="10000000dollars" type="currency">$10,000,000</measure> commutation money, instead of the <num value="300000">300,000</num> men killed for. &#x0022;Reports from the army indicate&#x0022; that a large proportion of the troops whose terms expire next year will re-enlist for a month's furlough is granted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>An Invalid corps has been established, composed of men rendered unfit for field duty by wounds and disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It numbers <num value="20000">20,000</num> men. The negro troops occupy a large portion of his message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They only get <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> a month, where the whites get <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">$11</measure>, and they get no bounties, which is not very surprising, seeing that they are seized neck and heels and pitched into the service without my movement of their own in the matter. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The artillery and arms which have been issued by the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> since the war commenced, and which, save that part captured by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, is now in use, is as follows: Siege and <orgName n="Sea Coast Artillery" type="artillery">sea-coast artillery</orgName>, <num value="2088">2,088</num> pieces; <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, <num value="2481">2,481</num>; fire-arms for infantry, <num value="1550576">1,550,576</num>; fire-arms for cavalry, <num value="327170">327,170</num>; sabres, <num value="271817">271,817</num>; cartridges for artillery, <num value="2274490">2,274,490</num>; and cartridges for small arms, <num value="378584104">378,584,104</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They are distributed in <num value="182">182</num> general hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The mortality this year has been less than the preceding <num value="1">one</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>To the unmilitary eye of the writer, however, it seemed to have a wider and more important bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>A demonstration in such great force and at so vital a point, looked as if it were the prelude to a battle for the possession of <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> and <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>.
