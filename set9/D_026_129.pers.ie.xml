<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> We are not among those who pay much attention to the stories of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>There may be some honest ones in the large number captured, but they are few and far between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The most communicative generally put on an air of great penitence, say they are tired of the war, and assert that they will take advantage the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity of relinquishing the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But once exchanged, they assume again their rabid abolition professions, tell the most exaggerated stories of their treatment at the <rs>South</rs>, and pretend to burn with a desire to revenge the injuries inflicted upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><num value="1">One</num> of the prisoners captured near <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover Junction</placeName> and brought to this city on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, seemed very anxious while at <placeName reg="Atlee's Station">Atlee's Station</placeName> to relieve himself of the odium of having volunteered to fight against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>He stated that he had &#x0022;followed she sea&#x0022; for a profession, and had always &#x0022;sedulously avoided&#x0022; the army; but coming in from a voyage, he got drunk, and, before he knew it, was a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This is similar to the statements of many others, and possibly forms an exception to the generality of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> stories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>There is no doubt of the fact that a popular method of filling up the ranks of the abolition army is to give the victim drugged whiskey, and while insensible from its effects, make a soldier of him, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">nolens volens.</hi></foreign> Another of the party was less communicative, and seemed averse to conversing upon his situation, or the movements of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>A citizen finally asked him if <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The prisoner looked up, and replied in the true <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vernacular--&#x0022;I guess he ain't.&#x0022; He was doubtless the most honest fellow in the lot, and his answer to the question furnished a key to his real feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The practice of conversing with prisoners is at best reprehensible, and should not be permitted by the guard having them in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>There is little or no satisfaction to be derived from it, and it only gratifies the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> instinct for display. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> The readers of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> cannot fail to be struck by the facts, arguments, and grave and we <unclear></unclear> eloquence of this remarkable document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It is thus far unanswered, and it, we verily believe, altogether unanswerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>How can <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Lewis,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> make any effort to bring about a restoration of peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>How can he open negotiations for that desirable purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Every attempt to communicate, even upon subjects involving the commonest interests of humanity, with the despotism at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, has been rejected with scorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The tyrant has already proclaimed the only terms upon which he will allow us to breathe the air, which is the common inheritance of all mankind; of the slave as well as of the free; of the captive in his dungeon, as well as of the <rs>King</rs> upon his throne,--He has not exhibited the slightest symptoms of a disposition to relax the rigor of these terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>indeed, his interpreters say, that even they were not meant for such as are still rebellious, but for those abject wretches, who have already thrown away their arms, and embraced the knees and kissed the feet of the tyrant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> But suppose the channel of communication were open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Suppose we could have free access to the royal person, and no obstacle were opposed to our opening a negotiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Does it become us to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to sue for peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>We are the injured party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>A most wicked, a most wanton, a most unjustifiable war has been made upon us, the only pretext for it being that we claimed certain rights which we maintain to be indubitable and inalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>In the prosecution of this war a series of atrocities has been perpetrated without any parallel in the history of modern civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>We have acted during the whole time entirely on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We have been willing, always, and so we have long since proclaimed, to be at peace, as soon as our enemy would consent to let us alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Has he shown any disposition to let us alone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>On the contrary, is he not at this very moment waging the war upon a scale more gigantic, and a system more atrocious, than ever before?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>And should we crawl upon our knees to his footstool, with our petition in our hand, and say, &#x0022;upon such a time you wantonly burned such a village &mdash; upon such another, you murdered so many of our helpless citizens &mdash; on such another, again, you laid waste a whole district without provocation, driving <num value="1000">thousands</num> into exile, reducing <num value="1000">thousands</num> to pauperism, and causing, probably, the death of <num value="1000">thousands</num> by starvation &mdash; and for all these kindly favors shown to us and ours, we beg you to make peace?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> In all cases of quarrel between individuals it is the man who does the wrong that ought to <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> propose a reconciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The man who suffers it cannot take such a step without humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>By a parity of reasoning, in all wars, the aggressor ought to make the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advances to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The injured nation or people cannot do it without self &mdash; abasement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>In our case it is certain that nothing but absolute submission would do, and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has already proclaimed the terms on which he will condescend to receive our submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>These proposals to initiate peace propositions on our side are to the last degree pernicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>they generate a treasonable spirit where it did not exist before, and keep it alive where it did &mdash; and that, too, whatever may be the intentions of those with whom they originate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>We regret to see the authority of such a name as <persName n="Vance,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="mostcommon:Vance,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Vance</surname></persName>'s given to proceedings so objectionable. </p>
