<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> A Chicago paper gives the following account of a row which recently occurred in that city, at the bottom of which is to be found the everlasting negro; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The doctrine of negro equality was practically illustrated in this city, by an affair which happened at the corner of <address><street n="Clark Street">Clark</street></address> and <address><street n="Randolph Street">Randolph</street></address> streets, yesterday forenoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/><num value="2">Two</num> negroes, laboring under the impression that the good time of equality had really come, entered <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName key="possibilities=36" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Clark</placeName> street omnibuses, standing at the locality mentioned, and took seats for a ride up town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><num value="1">One</num> of the darkeys was smoking a cheap cigar, while the other was guffawing <persName n="Lindly,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Lindly,nomatch:0"><surname>Lindly</surname></persName> at his own coarse jokes, which were not of the most refined sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><num value="2">Two</num> ladies were the other occupants of the omnibus, and these sat in the front of the vehicle, waiting for its departure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> The shades, however, continued smoking and grinning, until <num value="1">one</num> of the women, annoyed by the smoke and disagreeable odor of the cigar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>complained of the nuisance to the driver, <persName n="Kelly,,Richard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="default:Kelly,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Kelly</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The latter immediately opened the door, and, stating the causes of the lady's complaint, mildly requested the negroes to leave the omnibus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><num value="1">One</num> of the shades very properly complied with the request, but the other, indignantly remarking that he had <q>&#x0022;as many rights as any <num value="1">one</num>,&#x0022;</q> utterly refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The driver reported his request, adding that smoking in the omnibus was prohibited, and intimating that, unless his orders was obeyed he should proceed to eject the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The latter, however, was firm in his refusal, and insolent, too, for he not only reiterated his assertion about his rights, but also took the liberty of telling the driver that he might <q>&#x0022;be d &mdash; d.&#x0022;</q> This last remark provoked the rage of <persName n="Kelly,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Kelly,Richard,,,"><surname>Kelly</surname></persName>, who, without further ado, entered the 'bas and collared the impertinent darkey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Not only collared him, but prepared to eject him from the vehicle, and, upon meeting with resistance, administered <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> fist blows upon the nigger's face, which latter had the effect of entirely cowing his insubordination, and causing a summary departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The time of starting of the omnibus had now arrived, and the driver, having mounted his box, drove away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Meanwhile a crowd had been gathering on the corner, blocking up the street and walk, and causing considerable noise and confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The negro was howling with rage, and was indulging in all manner of curses and imprecations on the head of the driver, from whom he had received so undesirable a worsting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Yet in all that crowd he found little sympathy, until <persName n="Hesing,Sheriff,Anthony,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Hesing,Anthony,C.,,"><roleName n="Sheriff">Sheriff</roleName> <foreName>Anthony</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Hesing</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Cook, Illinois, United States" key="tgn,7013649">Cook county</placeName>, had arrived and inquired into the row. It is usually considered the duty of the constabulary force to preserve order, to quell riots, and disperse crowds or mobs, but <persName n="Hesing,Sheriff,Anthony,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Hesing,Anthony,C.,,"><roleName n="Sheriff">Sheriff</roleName> <foreName>Anthony</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Hesing</surname></persName> had this time a different idea of his responsibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Without taking any measure to restore the peace of the neighbor-hood he at once consulted the darkey, examined his injuries, and then prepared to act. Another omnibus had taken up its position at the corner, and into this he bade the darkey go. Then, taking <num value="2">two</num> other niggers, he disposed of them in the same manner, while he himself entered the omnibus, and, remarking, <q>&#x0022;I make no distinction between a negro and a white man,&#x0022;</q> took a scat by the side of his <rs n="Ethiopian" type="ethnic">Ethiopian</rs> freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The crowd was still increasing, and the confusion had reached its almost, when the omnibus started up the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The majority of the crowd favored the driver, and it was easy to see that <q>&#x0022;negro equality&#x0022;</q> was decidedly at a discount. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> <persName n="Hesing,Sheriff,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Hesing,Anthony,C.,,"><roleName n="Sheriff">Sheriff</roleName> <surname>Hesing</surname></persName>, with his <num value="3">three</num> black companions, proceeded as far up as the <rs>Southern</rs> battle yards, when the omnibus was halted and the <num value="4">four</num> got out. At this place <persName n="Hesing,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Hesing,Anthony,C.,,"><surname>Hesing</surname></persName> took his negroes into a saloon and treated them to whiskey and ale. This proceeding attracted a crowd, the <rs>Sheriff</rs> meanwhile protecting the darkeys from violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>After spending several minutes in this vicinity, the party started down <address><street n="Clark street">Clark street</street></address>, and belted at <address><street n="Liberty street">Liberty street</street></address>. In a few minutes the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> omnibus, driven by a new driver, approached, having made its trip, and being now on its return to the stand at the corner of <address><street n="Clark Street">Clark</street></address> and <address><street n="Randolph Street">Randolph</street></address> streets, the <rs>Sheriff</rs> signaled the driver to stop, which had the desired effect, and the omnibus was halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The driver was not disposed to obey, and told the <rs>Sheriff</rs> that he <q>#x34;didn't propose to drive that crowd.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> The order was repeated, but the driver again refused to drive unless the negroes got out. --The <rs>Sheriff</rs> grew excited, and became more and more peremptory, but each time met with a decided refusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The stoppage of the omnibus and the angry conversation between <persName n="Hesing,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Hesing,Anthony,C.,,"><surname>Hesing</surname></persName> and the driver had now gathered a crowd of men, some of whom comprehended the origin of the difficulty and were quite willing to sustain the driver against the niggers and their companion, <persName n="Hesing,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Hesing,Anthony,C.,,"><surname>Hesing</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The latter, fearing, doubt less, the gathering of a still larger crowd, and thinking it unsafe to insist on a further display of his folly, deserted his sable friends and proceeded down the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Thereupon the crowd interfered and at once compelled the negroes to come out, which they did with prudent alacrity, taking to their heels and running away, thoroughly convinced that <q>&#x0022;negro equality&#x0022;</q> was a humbug. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> During all this time people were gathering in masses at the corner of <address><street n="Clark Street">Clark</street></address> and <address><street n="Randolph Street">Randolph</street></address> streets, bent on venting their anger on the darkeys and the <rs>Sheriff</rs> in case they should again make their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It is fortunate for all that the <rs>Sheriff</rs> did not crown with success his scheme to bring the darkeys down the street to the omnibus, as a triumph over the driver, else there might have been a row equal in dimensions to the never-to-be-forgotten riots of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>There was certainly indignation enough at the insolent conduct of the darkey to have broken out in acts of violence, had he again appeared in the omnibus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Indeed, during the course of the afternoon, there were several fights in different parts of the city, in all of which negroes were the prominent actors and sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The affair became a fertile and almost universal topic of conversation throughout the city, and it was some time even before the excitement of the even had subsided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> The negro who caused the row is a porter for <persName n="Walker,,M.,O.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="default:Walker,M.,O.,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, on <address><street n="Dearborn street">Dearborn street</street></address>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> Is it to be lingering, fruitless and exhausting, or short, decisive and triumphant to the national arms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>These are questions which not only press upon the <rs>Executive</rs>, but which come home with emphatic force to the business and bosoms of all the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>And the <rs>Executive</rs> and the people must awake and act upon their stern reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The whole theory of the war must be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>We have been reminded that in dealing with the rebels we were dealing with our <q>&#x0022;misguided brethren,&#x0022;</q> and under a noble but delusive impulse, we have been gentle, tender, forbearing and forgiving, even to the verge of romance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Our <q>&#x0022;misguided brethren&#x0022;</q> have indulged in no such sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>They regard us only as foes, enemies, oppressors, invaders, <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs>, Vandale, and they strike at all Union men, not alone with the true energy of war, but with the malignity which inspires the above opprobrious names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>We must, therefore, cease to treat them with the tenderness of brethren. --Our kindness is wasted, our generosity thrown away, our forbearance contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Whaton destroyers of peace and prosperity of their country; treacherous assailants and armed foes of a Government against which they have no just complaint; enemies of the best interests of mankind, here and everywhere throughout the world; they must be held and pursued as such, and be punished with a severity commensurate with the magnitude and wantonness of their crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>We must have bold and decisive councils in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, followed by prompt action; we must have rapid movements in the field, and swift, hard, stunning blows struck at the enemy wherever found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>We <hi rend="italics">must take risks.</hi> insurgents, rebels, traitor, passive as well as active, must be made to know and feel the difference between loyalty and treason. </p> </q><bibl n="The Philadelphia Inquirer"></bibl></cit> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> Heretofore our policy in the enemy's country has been a premium to rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Pains and penalties, privation and loss, have been the lot of the <rs>Union</rs> people alone; gain, advantage, security, impunity, have been the fortune of none but rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>When <hi rend="italics">their</hi> troops occupy a tract of country all men who are not open and avowed Secessionists are hounded from their homes, robbed of their crops, provisions, cattle, cast into prison, or forced to serve in their battailous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>When our armies occupy that same country we make no difference between loyal men and traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>We pay the roble as full prices and as good money as we give the <rs>Union</rs> man. We carefully protect his forfeited property, and are scrupulously tender of his Confederate conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>By our past policy the inhabitants of the seceded States have everything to gain by being rebels and everything to dear and lose by adhering faithfully to the <rs>Union</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> All this &mdash; unless we would have the rebellion flourish until we are impoverished, bankrupt and exhausted &mdash; all this must be radically changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>As we have remarked, we must have such action as will make the rebel insurgents and traitors &mdash; passive as well as active-- know and feel the difference between loyalty and treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>When this policy is laid down by the <rs>Executive</rs> it must be enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>There should be no faltering in its execution, and no more paltering in a double sense between ourselves or with the foe. Rigid obedience should be everywhere exacted.

<head>The decisive hour.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> We are on the eve of great events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The hour of decision has been placed by <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> in our own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>In that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> we cherish an abiding faith and an unfaltering trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>But we do not believe that the <rs>Providence</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> conflicts with the free agency of man. It works for and with us in temporal as well as spiritual things; but in <num value="1">one</num> as in the other, we must use the means vouchsafed and the opportunities afforded, and work out our own salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has enabled us to smile back the enemy from the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>; but this was only the beginning of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>If we do not follow it up &mdash; if we do not heap blow upon blow &mdash; if we permit our enemy again to rally and organize &mdash; then, indeed, shall the summer be past, the harvest ended, and the day of our salvation delayed, if not forever gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>We rejoice to believe that our Government fully appreciates this momentous truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Now is the time to strike now, whilst our banners are flashing in the light of victory; whilst every Southern sword mirrors the bright forms of glory and hope; whilst the accursed foe is preparing once more for a final spring &mdash; now is the time for a blow that shall crush this hydra headed despotism for ever, and send an electric thrill of deliverance and joy from <num value="1">one</num> end to the <unclear></unclear> of this struggling, valiant, and glorious country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Without the language of rhetorical exaggeration, we can say to you that from <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> anxious homes the eyes of mothers, sisters, wives, and children are looking upon you &mdash; looking upon you, their brave and beloved &mdash; looking upon you as their only help and hope, save that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in whose hands are the issues of battles, and to whose Almighty Throne arise day and night those prayers of faith which he has promised to answer and to bless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Inspired by such reflections, let our gallant sons of the <rs>South</rs> once more give their glorious banners to the breeze, and let the resolve of every heart be <q>&#x0022;victory or death.&#x0022;</q> The whole <rs>South</rs> looks on; the world looks on; the fate of future generations trembles in the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Never did such calamities visit a civilized and <name>Christian</name> people as those which now threaten every Southern home, and which can only be averted by the power of Heaven and your own strong arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>And it is such a people who are driven from their happy homes, condemned to exile and poverty, because their consciences will not permit them to take an oath of allegiance to a hateful tyranny!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Verily, the ways of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> are hidden in mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> Shortly after <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> were startled by heavy and continuous reports of cannon, proceeding from the direction of <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The reports were very rapid and those who occupied eligible positions could distinctly see the flash of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>This was kept up for nearly <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, during which period <unclear></unclear> is estimated that there were no less than <num value="500">five hundred</num> discharges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>From information received yesterday morning, it appears that our artillery, including a number of heavy siege guns, which had been placed in position at and below <placeName reg="Coggins Point, Prince George, Virginia" key="tgn,2247725">Coggin's Point</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, opened a fierce cannonade during the night upon the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> and <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s camp, on the opposite side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The enemy was evidently taken by surprise, and all the lights of the fleet were immediately extinguished, but this did not prevent our gunners from preserving their range, which they had taken care to obtain with accuracy while daylight gave them an opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>A feeble response was made by the gunboats; but firing at random, and comparatively ignorant of our position, they inflicted little damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The fleet, on the contrary, is supposed to have suffered heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>A great crashing was heard in the river, and it is conjectured that collisions occurred among the vessels in their haste to get beyond the reach of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>At daylight yesterday morning the entire fleet had disappeared, and great commotion was visible in <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The scene on the opening of the cannonade is described as magnificent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The long line of Federal vessels drawn up near the shore opposite, with their glimmering lights, reminded the beholder of an illumination for some <unclear> tive</unclear> occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Our informant could tell very little of what occurred afterward, except in regard to the part sustained by the battery to which he belongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>From the position of affairs on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> the impression prevails that active operations cannot be long delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>For several days past the enemy have been making such disposition of his forces as to induce the belief that an advance is early contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Passengers by the <rs>Central</rs> train, last evening, represent that the main <orgName>army of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName></orgName> has moved up from <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> into <placeName reg="Madison, Dane, Wisconsin" key="tgn,7013966">Madison</placeName>, and that a considerable infantry force had been advanced in a southwesterly direction as far as <placeName reg="Standardsville, Greene, Virginia" key="tgn,2114351">Stanardsville, in Greene county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The infamous order of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Commandant of that Department has been put into practical operation, and, as a result, large numbers of horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, &#x0026;c. have been stolen from their rightful owners, and the stock of wheat, corn, and other necessaries of life, constituting the sustenance of the people, have been appropriated to the use of the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>In some instances families have been left upon the verge of starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Acts of the most infamous character enacted upon the negro women of the county are reported in the presence of white ladies, and in some instances deeds of violence have been perpetrated upon respectable ladies themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>The subject of the exchange of prisoners being new prominently before the public, it is proper that we should call attention to the case of <persName n="Day,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Day,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Day</surname></persName>, who has been imprisoned for a year at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>For a period after his arrest he was confined in the common jail, and kept in that vile receptacle for several months, when he was removed to the Old Capitol, to quarters but little better, and held in solitary confinement; made to sleep throughout the whole winter upon the bare floor, and allowed only sufficient food, of the <unclear>coarsest</unclear> kind, to support life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The pretext for such inhuman treatment towards this venerable gentleman was almost too absurd to be stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>He was charged with having put <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to death and fed them to his hogs!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>His commission, owing to the interruption of travel, did not reach there until after his arrest, up to which time he was indefatigable in the discharge of his professional duties, not only in behalf of our own brave soldiers, but towards the wounded of the enemy, <num value="2">two</num> of whom were under treatment in his own house when he was captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>His situation has always been a very critical <num value="1">one</num>, because, not being held as a prisoner of war, he is liable at any moment to be tried upon the charges above stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>He has no commission to protect him, and unless some express stipulation is made to that effect, he will not have the benefit of the new cartel for the exchange of prisoners. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>The enemy's scouts are the class who have, in exposed sections, committed the greatest outrages and depredations, atrocious instances of which have been reported to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; and it would seem but just that these offenders should be held as hostages for such of our own citizens as do not come under the protection of the articles of war.
