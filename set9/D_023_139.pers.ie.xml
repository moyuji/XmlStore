<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Early yesterday morning intelligence was received in this city that the ball had opened in earnest at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and that, from the character of the fight, there was little room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>No doubt a general engagement would ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Throughout the day, anxiety was evinced to hear from the field of conflict, and as usual, rumors of every variety were most industriously circulated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Passengers by the <rs>Fredericksburg</rs> train last night report that the enemy attempted simultaneously to cross the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> at <num value="3">three</num> different points &mdash; the <rs type="place">Railroad bridge</rs> at the town, <persName n="Knox,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Knox,nomatch:0"><surname>Knox</surname></persName>'s kill, and <placeName reg="Deep Run, Page, Virginia" key="tgn,2281284">Deep Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The attempt was made about <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time> A. A. At the <num value="2">two</num> former places they were repulsed with great slaughter by our sharp-shooters, who, from the defences of their rifle pits, poured a galling fire into the ranks of the enemy, who fell back in confusion, after having sustained a heavy loss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Our loss is reported to be only <measure n="5" type="killed">5 killed</measure> and <measure n="75" type="wounded">75 wounded</measure>. At <placeName reg="Deep Run, Page, Virginia" key="tgn,2281284">Deep Run</placeName> the enemy were more successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Under the protection of their heavy batteries they succeeded in crossing &mdash; in what force we were unable to ascertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Our men fell back in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is stated that our batteries completely sweep the plateau at this point, and that so far from having secured any advancing by the passage of the river, they have placed themselves in exactly the position that our commanding General wishes them. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The latest advices received are contained in a dispatch dated <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time>, which states that a large force of the enemy had succeeded in effecting a crossing and that it was expected that the fight would be renewed again this morning. </p> </div3>

<head>The report of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the navy</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> We presented a few days ago a brief synopsis of the report of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, which alluded to the operations of that particular branch of the service since the war commenced.--This morning we give some extracts from that portion of the report in which the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s views are given with reference to the establishment of a navy yard for the construction of iron clad vessels of war. In <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> last, and again in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, the attention of Congress was invited to the importance of taking prompt preliminary measures for establishing a navy yard, including foundries, shops, and docks adapted to the growing wants of the service and the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It was not that an additional navy-yard was needed, but that <num value="1">one</num> of a different character was required from any now in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He then refers to the action of Congress on the subject which authorized the appointment of a <orgName n="Officers Board" type="board">Board of Officers</orgName> to examine into and investigate the advantages of certain localities as a site for the establishment of such a yard as was proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><placeName reg="League Island">League Island</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, received the recommendation of a majority of the committee and, unless otherwise directed by Congress, the <rs>Secretary</rs> proposes to accept it as the point for the establishment of the new navy-yard for the construction of iron- clads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Among reasons given for this determination are, its security from external enemies, and its proximity to iron and coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> says further: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The time has arrived when in order to maintain ourselves and our true position as a nation, we must have a formidable navy, not only of light draft vessels to guard our extensive and shallow coast, but <num value="1">one</num> that, with vessels always ready for the service and of sufficient size to give them speed, can seek and meet an enemy on the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In order to obtain the enormous steam power essential to great speed, we must have vessels of the greatest magnitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Vessels of wood will always be built; but the causes that have operated to retard the introduction of iron vessels are disappearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The working of iron has been much simplified; its application facilitated; new tools and machinery for working it are constantly being invented and improved; artisans skilled in its manufacture are becoming more common, and the material more easily wrought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The progress of events renders it certain that iron will hereafter enter largely into the structure of vessels for marine service, although it will never entirely supercede wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> produces the material in abundance, and we have no occasion to seek it from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>While our forests are disappearing, inexhaustible resources in iron are being developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>That it is for the interest of the <rs>Government</rs> to be prepared to meet some change in the material and structure of our naval vessels, need not be repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It must provide the necessary yards and establishments for each, and have them properly located, in which to build its ships-of-war and at least <num value="1">one</num> of them should be specially adapted to iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>No private establishment can undertake such heavy work as the <rs>Government</rs> requires for its armor and steam purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Possessing advantages that no other nation enjoys, we should avail ourselves of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Our iron and coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We found in the same region, and we have fresh-water rivers in which iron vessels can be docked and kept clean, and from which all enemies can be excluded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> In the construction of the iron and iron-clad vessels which the <name>Department</name> has now in progress, every effort has been made to have them promptly completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is believed that nearly every rolling mill has been engaged that is able to do the work; and yet these vessels are several months behind the time within which they were to have been completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The Department is convinced that the contractors have done their best; and yet it is with great difficulty that these comparatively small vessels and the moderate-sized iron required can be procured for them as soon as wanted, so much aces the demand exceed the capabilities of the mills to supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>These facts demonstrate the necessity of <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName> where vessels of great magnitude are to be constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Had the <rs>Government</rs> been prepared for this heavy work, much of the delay which has embarrassed naval operations might have been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> establishments would have been relieved, and enabled to furnish a lar or quantity within the scope of their own manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is as important that the <rs>Government</rs> should build its own ships of iron as of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>If the apparent cost in either case is greater, the actual value is also greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is of the firm importance that the material, whether of iron or wood should be of the best quality, and as regards iron, this can be insured and made certain only by its being received and reworked at Government establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The large quantities required will always </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> enable the <rs>Government</rs> to purchase on economical terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is well understood that the quality of iron varies greatly, and the use of inferior kinds will be both injurious and expensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Experiments with shot in target practice demonstrate that some qualities have much greater powers of resistance than others, and are therefore better for armature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Other qualities may better resist corrosion, and be more suitable to the action of sea water, and still others may be adapted to the internal parts exposed to different chemical action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>These qualities and denominations will be ascertained by observations and tests that the <rs>Government</rs> can alone well make and faithfully apply in the construction of its war vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Contractors and private establishments will not be equally vigilant and careful in making the proper selections and assorting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> An establishment such as the <name>Department</name> has in view, and has heretofore recommended, will enable the <rs>Government</rs> to have all the advantages of the best and most suitable descriptions in the construction of vessels of iron and of iron armature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Steam machinery, anchors, chains, cables, and heavy <rs n="iron work" type="product">iron work</rs> for the naval service, would be manufactured at the same establishment to advantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The necessity of such a dock yard and establishment is becoming so important that I deem it proper again to present the subject to the consideration of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>As yet we have but few iron vessels, and these chiefly of foreign construction; but we have built and are building iron-clad vessels at private establishments &mdash; not <num value="1">one</num> at our public yards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> In sustaining our position as a naval power we must be prepared for reverses that may befall us in battle or by calamities incident to ocean service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>A wise precaution will always provide a reserve of ships to take the place of those that may be injured or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Vessels should be in different stages of progress of construction, there by giving constant employment to a certain number of skillful mechanics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Stores of material can well be accumulated in days of peace for the emergencies of war. </p> </q><bibl n="Secretary"></bibl></cit> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Western depot and establishment.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> It will be advisable at an early period to establish a naval depot on <num value="1">one</num> of the rivers in the <rs type="place">Valley of the Mississippi</rs>, where we now have a squadron equal in numbers to the whole navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at the commencement of this Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The want of an establishment in that quarter, where vessels may be constructed, armed and armored, equipped and repaired, has been severely felt; and, in the absence of such an establishment, the department has been compelled to resort to expedients that may have been sometimes disadvantageous. </p>

The war is insufficient to restore the <rs>Union</rs>, he says; it may chastise and silence the rebels in the field, but it cannot make a <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it was thought the conflict at the <rs>South</rs> was only against the leaders, but it turns out that it is with the whole mass of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and with such a power, sooner or later, we (the <rs>North</rs>) will have to treat or negotiate; the sword alone will never restore this people to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>He was for peaceful means when the present calamities <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> threatened, and he still thinks that other means besides war are necessary to save the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> He knows how easy it is to talk about the war, strategical positions, victories, &#x0026;c., and how pleasant it is to some to float along with this popular current; but the time is coming when some <num value="1">one</num> must strike for the right, regardless of consequences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> He alludes to the duration of the war, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> national debt, the numbers killed, wounded, and deceased, and thinks these things demonstrate the futility of war alone to extricate the country from its difficulties. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> He next denounces the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, and the extermination of her people; and expresses himself in favor of re-establishing <q>&#x0022;the <rs>Union</rs> as it was,&#x0022;</q> or as near like it as practicable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> He then repeats his belief in the impotency of the sword alone to settle the difficulty, and recommends a <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">Convention of the States</orgName> in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The States now in the <rs>Union</rs> should be in convention, or have delegates ready to go into convention, in order to re-affirm the present constitutional relations as may be found necessary to bring together and retain all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The State Legislatures could petition Congress for such a convention, as provided by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and Congress could make the necessary provisions for it before the close of the coming session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Such State Legislatures as do not meet in the regular order, could specially convene; and when the necessary number of States petition, it is obligatory on Congress to comply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> &#x0022;The body thus constituted would be compelled to adjust and settle all complications which now beset us. In the midst of war, then, we should be prepared to make peace; whereas, when the time comes for settlement, in the absence of such a body, it might be found that we have no competent authority in existence to do the things that may be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Neither Congress nor the <rs>Executive</rs> nor the <num value="2">two</num> together, have rightful authority to change the old or make new relations among the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Congress may submit amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> for the ratification of the <name>States</name>, and I believe the present calamities of the nation could have been averted in that way in the winter of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; but now the disorders of the country are probably too complicated to be reached in that form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> &#x0022;Meanwhile, the <rs>President</rs> and Congress should prepare the way for settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Indeed, by consulting the people through the ballot-box, they might make a settlement, to be ratified by the <name>States</name> thereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Let the <rs>President</rs> propose an armistice, for the purpose of considering some programme of reunion and settlement, in which the feelings and rights of the masses in the <rs>South</rs> shall be duly appreciated and provided for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Suppose the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities rejected this, or any similar proposition, no harm could ensue to the <rs>Northern</rs> cause.

<head>A sudden transformation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> This is an extraordinary war. In its best aspect war is not the most agreeable and beneficent of human operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>But it has been found practicable among civilized nations to bring it under the control of certain laws, which relieve it of many horrors common powers among barbarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The present war, considering that it is can led on by a people professing not only to be civilized, but the most enlightened and religious on the face of the earth is a very remarkable contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>We question whether the history of human society ever presented such a sudden transformation in the aspect of a whole nation as has been effected in the <rs>North</rs> by this war. We can scarcely realize that we are living on the same continent or in the same world as <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> From the settlement of <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName>, the character of the <rs>Northern</rs> people had exhibited no special information nor aptitudes for belligerent movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Not that it was deficient in courage, nor, at any rate upon the sea, in warlike enterprise.--There have been few equals in any navy to the <name>Truxious</name> and Hinmans of the <name>Revolution</name>, (descendants of both of whom are now found battling on the side of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>,) or the <name>Perrys</name>, Huils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Bainbridges, McDonoughs, of the late war But these cases are not illustrative of the general genius and temper of the nation; and, moreover, not a few of them were of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The out and out <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs>, though not deficient in pluck, prefers the peaceful picking of his neighbor's pockets, in the pursuit of trade and commerce, to the perilous plunder of the battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It was only in the bloodless conflicts of bargain and sale that the descendants of the <name>Cavaliers</name> had ever been called on to face the descendants of the <name>Roundheads</name> in <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It is needless to say that in those conflicts we uniformly got the worst of it. And who did not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They had cheated the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> out of their eyes, and swindled the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> off the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The offspring of the <name>Cavaliers</name> fell an easy prey to the children of the <unclear>ritans.</unclear>. From the time when long lines of pedlar wagons invaded the <rs>South</rs> to the time when long lines of railroads carried their better dressed but equally nasal and vulgar drummers to every dwelling, they victimized the <rs>Southern</rs> community in every shape and form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>All this was natural, and had become so common that to be commercially skinned by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> was a luxury which we scarcely knew how to dispense with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But that all these peaceful traders should some day send an army here to cut the throats of their old customers, seemed a piece of insanity which no <num value="1">one</num> not himself insane could attribute to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> Moreover, there was another reason why, apparently, such a thing could never happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> race had become the most pious and humane, as well as the most shrewd and commercial of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>They had improved upon the <rs>Christian</rs> religion in several important particulars, and as for <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, he was an ignorant outside barbarian, in comparison with most of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle theologians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>War and slavery, neither of which are prohibited in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, had been ascertained to be high crimes by the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> moralists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The capital punishment of the vilest murderer made them shudder with horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>They invented Teetotal Societies and colossal Bible, Tract, <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>, and a <num value="100">hundred</num> other benevolent and religious associations, which celebrated their anniversaries every <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> in New York, letting loose such a multitude of cadaverous, dyspeptic and unearthly saints upon the country that scarcely a bird presumed to sing or a flower to bloom in their presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>So powerful and sanctified had the religious organizations of the <rs>North</rs> become, that they confidently expected soon to reform the whole world, and many excellent people in the <rs>South</rs> began to believe that the <name>Millennium</name> was at hand! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> But it was not the <name>Millennium</name> that was at hand, as we now perceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It was something else, very different from the <name>Millennium</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Yet who could have imagined that beneath such a saintly surface should be boiling all the fires of hell, soon to be let loose upon us and all we hold dear?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Who could have believed that the commercial columns which had invaded us in peace would be turned into military columns, and that the legions of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> saints and angels would so soon become murderers and demons?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Much of this astonishment arises from the foot that we have only known the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> in peace, and never met him in war till now. Whoever will turn to the annals of that race in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will find that, in almost every particular, so far as the development of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> character is concerned, history is only repeating itself in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The brutal, cruel, greedy, licentious, hypocritical, and sacrilegious Roundheads are alive again in their descendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We have no peace to expect with the <rs>North</rs> as long as the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> element is permitted to control their politics or their society. </p> </div3>
