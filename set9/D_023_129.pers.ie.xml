<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> watches with painful interest the struggle which has been raging more than a year upon the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The hostilities have provoked sacrifices and efforts certainly of a nature to inspire the highest idea of the perseverance and energy of the <num value="2">two</num> populations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But this spectacle, which does so much honor to their courage, is only given at the price of numberless calamities and a prodigious effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>To these results of civil war, which, from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, assumed vast proportions, there is still to be added the apprehension of servile war, which would be the culminating point of so many irreparable disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The suffering of a nation towards which we have always professed a sincere friendship would have sufficed to excite the sincere solicitude of the <rs>Emperor</rs> even had we ourselves not suffered by the counter blow of these events. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Under the influence of intimate relations which extensive intercourse has multiplied between the various regions of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> itself has suffered from the consequences of the crisis which has dried up <num value="1">one</num> of the most fruitful sources of public wealth, and which has become, for the great centres of labor, a cause of most sad trials. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> As you are aware, when the conflict commenced, we held it our duty to observe the most strict neutrality in concert with other maritime Powers, and the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs> has repeatedly acknowledged the honorable manner with which we adhere to that line of conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The sentiments dictated to us have undergone no change but of a benevolent character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>That neutrality, instead of imposing upon the <name>Powers</name> the attitude which might resemble indifference, ought rather to make them of service to the <num value="2">two</num> parties by helping them out of a position which seems to have no issue &mdash; From the commencement of the war an armed force was set on foot by the belligerents which, since then, has been almost constantly kept up.--After so much bloodshed they are now, in that respect, nearly in the same position, nothing authorizing the presumption that more decisive military operations will shortly occur, according to the last news received in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The <num value="2">two</num> armies on the contrary, were in a condition that would not allow either party to hope within a brief delay for any decided advantage to turn the balance and accelerate the conclusion of a peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> All these circumstances, taken together, point to the opportunity of an armistice, to which, moreover, under the present circumstances, no strategical objection can be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The favorable dispositions towards peace which are beginning to manifest themselves in the <rs>North</rs> as well as the <rs>South</rs>, might on the other hand, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> steps that might be made to recommend the idea of truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><rs type="role" reg="Emperor">The Emperor</rs> has, therefore, thought that the occasion has presented itself of offering to the belligerents the support of the good offices of the maritime Powers, and <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name> has charged me to make the <unclear>proposition</unclear> of this government to her Britannic Majesty, as well as to the <rs type="place">Court of Russia</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The <num value="3">three</num> Cabinets would exert their influence at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as well as with the <rs>Confederates</rs> to obtain an armistice for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, during which every act of war, direct or indirect should provisionally cease, on sea as well as on land, and it might be, if necessary, ulteriorly prolonged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> The overtures, I need not say, sir, would not imply, on our part, any judgment on the origin or issue of the struggle nor any pressure upon the negotiations which might, it is to be hoped, ensue in favor of an armistice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Our task would consistently in smoothing down obstacles, and in interfering only in a measure determined upon by the <num value="2">two</num> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We should not, in fact, believe ourselves called upon to decide, but to prepare the solution of difficulties which hitherto have opposed reconciliation between the belligerent parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Would not, moreover an agreement between the three Courts respond sufficiently to their intentions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Would it not give to their step the character of evident impartiality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Acting in concert, they would combine the conditions best suited to inspire confidence &mdash; the government of the <rs>Emperor</rs> by the constant tradition of <name>French</name> policy towards the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--<placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, by the community of race &mdash; <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, by the marks of friendship she has never ceased to show to the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Should the event not justify the hope of the <num value="3">three</num> Powers, and should the ardor of the struggle over rule the wisdom of the councils, this attempt would not be the less honorable for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>They would have fulfilled a duty of humanity, more especially indicated in a war which has excited passions which render all direct attempts at negotiation more difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It is the mission which international law assigns neutrals, at the same time that it prescribes to them a strict impartiality, and they could never make a nobler use of their influence by endeavoring to put an end to a struggle which causes so much suffering and compromises such great interests throughout the whole world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> Finally, even without immediate results, these overtures would not be entirely useless, for they might encourage public opinion to views of conciliation, and thus contribute to hasten the moment when the return of peace might become possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> I request you, sir in the name of <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name>, to submit these considerations to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> or to <rs type="role2">Prince</rs> <unclear>Gortschak ff,</unclear> begging him to state the views of the <rs>Government</rs> or her Britannic Majesty or the <rs type="place">Court of Russia</rs>. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="L'Huys,,Drouyn,De,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:L'Huys,Drouyn,De,,"><foreName>Drouyn</foreName> <foreName>De</foreName> <surname>L'Huys</surname></persName>.</hi> </p> </div5> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>In this dispatch, the <rs>Minister</rs> for Foreign Affairs states that the <rs>Emperor</rs> has followed with painful interest the struggle which had now been going on for more than a year on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> going on for more than a year on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He does justice to the energy and perseverance which have been displayed on both sides; but he observes that these proofs of their courage have been given at the expense of innumerable calamities and immense bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>To these accompaniments of the civil conflict is to be added the apprehension of servile war, which would be the climax of so many irreparable misfortunes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> If these calamities affected <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> only, these sufferings of a friendly nation, would be enough to excite the anxiety and sympathy of the <rs>Emperor</rs>; but <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> also has suffered in <num value="1">one</num> of the principal branches of her industry, and her artisans have been subjected to most cruel trials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and the maritime Powers have, during the struggle, maintained the strictest neutrality, but the sentiments by which they are animated, far from imposing on them anything like indifference, seem, on the contrary, to require that they should assist the <num value="2">two</num> belligerent parties in an endeavor to escape from a position which appears to have no issue. --The forces of the <num value="2">two</num> sides have hitherto fought with balanced success, and the latest accounts do not show any prospect of a speedy termination of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> These circumstances, taken together, would seem to favor the adoption of measures which might bring about a truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/><rs type="role" reg="Emperor">The Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, therefore, is of the opinion that there is now an opportunity of offering to the belligerents the good offices of the maritime Powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The French Government is of the opinion that even in the event of a failure of immediate success, these overtures might be useful in leading the minds of men now heated by a passion to consider the advantages of conciliation and peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> Such is in substance the proposal of the government of the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, and I need hardly say that it has attracted the serious attention of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> government.
