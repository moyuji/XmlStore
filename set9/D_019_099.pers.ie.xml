<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>When we saw them they were discontented, in subordinate, and swearing at the city, their officers and everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> feels as much like a soldier when out of uniform as he does when in it. There is a pride in the cloth which is no mean part of the spirit of an army.
