<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> and Congress have both called attention to the subject of absenteeism and desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In its late address to the people, Congress says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> &#x0022;We have upon our rolls a very large army of veteran soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is true &mdash; and it is a sad truth to confess &mdash; that the number present for duty is terribly disproportion to the entire aggregate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This is too notorious for concealment &mdash; and we have no desire to conceal anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We wish to speak frankly and truthfully to you of the actual condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The number of absentees from your armies has been a fruitful cause of disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>On many a hard-fought field the tide of success would have turned overwhelmingly in our favor had all be a present whom duty required to participate in the strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We will not stop to inquire into the causes of an evil which we have so much reason to deplore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The remedy is partly in the hands of Congress, and it is our province to apply it. But it is partly, also, in yours, and we appeal to you to use it. Let every good citizen frown down upon, and indignantly discountenance, all evasion of military duty, whether temporary or permanent &mdash; no matter how plausible the pretext or palliating the reason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> &#x0022;No duty, in this crisis of our affairs, can be more imperative than to fight for <num value="1">one</num>'s country, family and home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Let no skulker, deserter, or absentee without leave, from the army, be tolerated in any community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Let the reproachful glance of our women, between whose honor and the brutal foe our noble army stands as a flaming sword drive him back to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>With proper-officers, strict discipline, and an elevated tone of public opinion throughout the country, desertion and absenteeism in the army can be arrested, and all men liable to military duty put into, and kept in, the ranks of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If this be effected, we can maintain in the field a force sufficient to defy subjugation.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Congress"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> We commend this appeal to the people, to our brethren of the press, and to deserters and absentees themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>We know that all are not equally culpable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>But the time has come when none of them can longer forsake his noble comrades without everlasting remorse and shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Already have we been brought to great disasters by their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>But they may still retrieve their good names by coming back at this critical moment and helping the brethren they have deserted to achieve a triumph which will cast into the shade all their former delinquencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>What can they gain, if, by their desertion and absence, we are conquered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Will the enemy respect them any more than those who have been faithful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Was there ever an enemy who, while he loved the treason, did not despise the traitor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Was <persName n="Arnold,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><surname>Arnold</surname></persName> an object of love to the <rs>British Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>They will be the most miserable and the most scorned, both by friend and foe, of all the inhabitants, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, of a subjugated land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>How will they like to look upon themselves, their wives and children, reduced to the social position of negroes, thrust aside from every way of earning their bread by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and foreigners, and feel that but for themselves this degradation and misery might not have been?--But look at the other side of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>What will be their condition if we succeed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Let us tell them that this is no such impossible matter as some of them fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>There are armies in the field who are strong and confident of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>There is a just <name n="God" type="God">God</name> above, who controls the destinies of nations, and can save by many or by few. The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can never bring such forces into the field as it has had in times past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Their capitalists are becoming alarmed by the prospect of an indefinite prolongation of the war.--Their public debt is believed to be already equal to the national debt of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>A grand financial crash may, at any moment, bring their arrogant pretensions to the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>If true to ourselves, if faithful and enduring, we shall, with the blessing of Heaven, yet accomplish our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>And what will be the feelings, in that event, of the men who have forsaken their country in her trials, and their comrades in their danger?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>How will they like to be pointed at then as deserters, and have that name cling to their children and their children's children?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deserter need feel no shame, for he is deserting an <orgName n="Army of Invasion" type="army">army of invasion</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>But a Confederate deserter,--a man who forsakes the defence of his country, his home, his liberty, his own flesh and blood,--who <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> abandons all them to save his own life from danger, what language has power to describe such a deed? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The C&#x00153;sarean and the <name>Bonapartist</name> maxims of government are shown to be the same; and, indeed, so they are, for they are the maxims of absolutism all the world over. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> &#x0022;In writing history,&#x0022; says the <rs>Imperial</rs> historian, &#x0022;what are the means to ascertain the truth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The only way is to follow the rules of logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Let us take it for granted at once that great results are always due to a great cause; never to a small <num value="1">one</num>--in other words, an incident insignificant in appearance never leads to great results without a pre-existing cause, which has allowed that small incident to achieve a great result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>A spark does not create a great conflagration unless it falls upon combustible materials accumulated beforehand.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> From such premises he infers that if the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs>, for nearly a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure>, always came forth from the severest trials that any nation was ever subjected to, superior to their adversaries, it was because there was some general cause which rendered them superior to their enemies, and did not permit defeats and partial cause to interrupt their sway.--In the same way, if the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs>, after having, under the influence of liberty, overrun and subdued nearly the whole of the world then known, have, since the time of C&#x00E6;sar, been prone to slavery and serfdom in all their degrading forms, it is because there was a general reason for it. &#x0022;It is,&#x0022; says the <rs>Emperor</rs>, &#x0022;because the wants and the interests of a society in labor required other means to be satisfied.&#x0022; In other words, the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> people were no longer what they had been in by-gone days.--The conquest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, of the <rs>East</rs>, and of <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName>, had let in a flood of luxury and wealth which had utterly corrupted the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The people had begun to think all about property, and nothing about liberty; and it is a melancholy truth, illustrated by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> modern examples, that when the love of money has once gained the ascendant, every evil that can flow from a total depravation of manners is but too apt to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>If C&#x00E6;sar had not taken upon himself to be master of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, somebody else would have done so &mdash; some <num value="1">one</num> among the many military chiefs who <sic>who</sic> were always hanging about the <rs>Republic</rs>, full of ambition and talent, and always on the look-out for an opportunity to push their own fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Such a thing as the dictatorship of C&#x00E6;sar could not have occurred in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> before, while the <rs>Republic</rs> was engaged in its desperate struggle with <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>That it could occur <hi rend="italics">now</hi> was owing to no fault of C&#x00E6;sar himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He did not mould the fashion of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He took advantage of circumstances which he saw gathered to his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>That was all. Foolish <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> writers have revved against him because he destroyed the liberties of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>This has been because, until <date value="1864-02">February, 1864,</date> the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> furnished the prisoners, and often had provisions or funds, when the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">Commissary Department</orgName> was not so well provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Once, and only once, for a few weeks, the prisoners were without meat; but a larger quantity of bread and vegetable food was, in consequence, supplied to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>According to that statement, it was common, during a cold spell in winter, to see several prisoners frozen to death every morning in the places in which they had slept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>This picture, if correct, might well excite our horror; but, unhappily for its sensational power, it is but a clumsy daub, founded on the fancy of the painter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The facts are, that tents were furnished sufficient to shelter all the prisoners; that the <rs>Confederate</rs> commandant and soldiers on the island were lodged in similar tents; that a fire was furnished in each of them; that the prisoners fared as well as their guards; and that only <num value="1">one</num> of them was ever frozen to death, and he was frozen <hi rend="italics">by the cruelty of his own fellow prisoners,</hi> who thrust him out of the tent in a freezing night because he was infested with vermin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The proof as to the healthiness of the prisoners on <placeName reg="Belle Isle, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,2161656">Belle Isle</placeName>, and the small amount of mortality, is remarkable, and presents a fit comment on the lugubrious pictures drawn by the &#x0022;sanitary commission&#x0022; either from their own fancies or from the fictions put forth by their false witnesses.

<head>Mine under the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> Your committee proceed next to notice the allegation that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities had prepared a mine under the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs>, and placed in it a quantity of gunpowder for the purpose of blowing up the buildings, with their inmates, in case of an attempt to rescue them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>After ascertaining all the facts bearing on this subject, your committee believe that what was done under the circumstances will meet a verdict of approval from all whose prejudices do not blind them to the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The state of things was unprecedented in history, and must be judged of according to the motives at work and the result accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>A large body of Northern raiders, under <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Dahlgren,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, was approaching <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It was ascertained, by the reports of prisoners captured from them, and other evidence, that their design was to enter the city, to set fire to the buildings, public and private, for which purpose turpentine balls, in great numbers, had been prepared; to murder the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> and other prominent men; to release the prisoners of war, then numbering <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000">six thousand</num>; to put arms into their hands, and to turn over the city to indiscriminate pillage, rape and slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>At the same time, a plot was discovered among the prisoners to co-operate in this scheme, and a large number of knives and slung-shots (made by putting stones into woolen stockings) were detected in places of concealment about their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>To defeat a plan so diabolical, assuredly the sternest means <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> were justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If it would have been right to put to death any <num value="1">one</num> prisoner attempting to escape under such circumstances, it seems logically certain that it would have been equally right to put to death any number making such attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But, in truth, the means adopted were those of humanity and <hi rend="italics">prevention,</hi> rather than of execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The Confederate authorities felt able to meet and repulse <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> and his raiders if they could prevent the escape of the prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> The real object was to save their lives, as well as those of our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The guard force at the prisons was small, and all the local troops in and around <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> were needed to meet the threatened attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Had the prisoners escaped, the women and children of the city, as well as their homes, would have been at the mercy of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> outlaws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Humanity required that the most summary measures should be used to <hi rend="italics">deter</hi> them from-any attempt at escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> A mine was prepared under the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs>; a sufficient quantity of gun-powder was put into it, and pains was taken <hi rend="italics">to inform the prisoners</hi> that any attempt at escape made by them would be effectually defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The plan succeeded perfectly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The prisoners were awed, and kept quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The danger passed away, and in a few weeks the gunpowder was removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Such are the facts.

<head>Means for Securing Cleanliness.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> The next charge is that the <rs type="place">Libby and Belle Isle</rs> prisoners were habitually kept in a filthy condition, and that the officers and men confined there were prevented from keeping themselves sufficiently clean to avoid vermin and similar discomforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The evidence clearly contradicts this charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>It is doubtless true that, notwithstanding these facilities, many of the prisoners were lousy and filthy; but it was the result of their own habits, and not of neglect in the discipline or arrangements of the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Many of the prisoners were captured and brought in while in this condition.
