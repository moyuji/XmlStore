<head>The defence of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of defending this place and repelling the enemy completely, and for the war, from it. Therefore, to those who regard it in the proper light, the determination of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, the <rs>Executive</rs> and <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName>, and the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> of this city, to defend it to the uttermost, and to suffer it to be raxed to the ground before it shall be surrendered to the mere demand of a flotilla of gunboats, is in the highest degree gratifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>We have the faith that the pledges of these high powers will be religiously carried cut; became we not only believe in their sincerity, but we believe in the determination of the people to sustain them, and, more than all, in the courage and undying constancy of our soldiers, and especially of those sons of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> on whom may devolve a conspicuous part in the great act of a defence so important. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> That the enemy will bring every means in his power to bear upon this devoted city, that he will leave no <hi rend="italics">trick, no art, no machinery,</hi>his cunning and ingenuity can devise, unemployed to throw the gloomy pall of his power and authority over this community, is beyond doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>He is at this time congregating his multitudes and accumulating his machines, for this purpose, upon our waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>He will array all his power near us in a very short time; and nothing but the courage and manhood of our people &mdash; nothing but a determination not to be conquered, and an energy suited to such determination, can thwart him. He will outnumber us &mdash; he will beat us in machinery &mdash; he will make a desperate struggle to get the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He is right in considering it a key to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and almost the heart of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It has done so much to keep up the spirit of the resistance and supply the means of defence &mdash; its capacity to continue this supply is so much greater than that of any other place &mdash; it is the capital of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; and in short, a place of so much historic fame, as well as political importance, that it would be to the <name>Federalists</name> their proudest and most valuable achievement of the war to get possession of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> Everybody knows all this, and therefore everybody ought to know that a successful defence against such efforts as the enemy will exert to take the place must be most energetic, sleepless, and wisely directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>A supineness unaccountable, an apathy which has been amazing, prevailed with reference to the defences of the river up to the time of the unexampled act of the destruction of the <rs>Merrimac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>This brought the enemy, to our only water barrier, within <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>That calamity did produce a yawning and a slow opening of the eyes, and finally some energy of the hands; but not until the <rs>Monitor</rs> came, with its terrible admonitions, did we behold a really lively and spirited putting forth of energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Late as it was we have seen what could be done at so late a day.--That so much could be done in so brief a space is most encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The repulse given the enemy's pioneer boats afforded further time to increase our means of defence, and it has not been lost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> When the enemy returns we may be assured the difficulties in his way will be much increased, while our land force will be ready to repel his attempt to take our batteries by a land approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We take all this for granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We have wise <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the neighborhood, and they know what the enemy will do, and have no doubt prepared for him. That a great force will be concentrated by the enemy by way of the peninsula and the river, with all possible rapidity, there cannot be a doubt.--He will be met. He has such great objects in view that we are led to hope that he will promptly give us battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>If he does so in the field, we are confident he will be beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>If he is, he will not take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The great contest which will, in all probability, take place in the very vicinity of the city, will be decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Should they be defeated, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can hardly bring such another army against us; while, if we are victorious, we can even repel and scatter such another army. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The <rs>West</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> The news from the <rs>West</rs> shows that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hordes are pressing onward from beyond <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghenies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> has checked the column from the <rs>Northwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>But the column marching upon the <rs>Central</rs> road by way of the <rs type="place">Kanawha Valley</rs>, has met with no obstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It is said to have reached <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s river depot; but we doubt the statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>If it be so, the sudden appearance of the enemy there, will somewhat after <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>If he undertakes to look after that advance, we believe he will act with sufficient celerity to frustrate the invasion by that route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Now, it is of the extremest importance that <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName> should be in the field with that force which confides in him. He has the energy and boldness to meet the exigencies of mountain campaigning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/><num value="1">One</num> thing is certain; and that is that the enemy is displaying a great deal of energy and rapidity in his movements in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>To meet him, we must also be active and sagacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>We must abandon forever inactivity &mdash; inactivity under the delusion that it is <q>&#x0022;masterly. &#x0022;</q> If we do not, we shall indeed be <q>&#x0022;pushed to the wall,&#x0022;</q> as <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> says.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>We must go to work seriously, and not rest until we have driven back the enemy and visited upon him some of those terrors which his invasion has carried to the homes of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We have some leaders who will pursue this kind of war, and our soldiers are eager for it. They know the horrors of the hospital and heart-sickening despondency of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>They pray for the march and the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They pray for the death (if they are to die) in the gallant and glorious fight, rather than that miserable <num value="1">one</num> from camp fever, in the loathsome hospital. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> We struck the <rs>Monitor</rs> and <rs>Galena</rs> again and again; and I think from the manner with which they seemed to recoil at our heavy shot that something about them must have been put out of place. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The evening previous she had taken aboard <num value="4">four</num> guns for <num value="1">one</num> of the newly- erected works, either that on <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 1667" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Morris Island</placeName> of <placeName reg="Fort Timber">Fort Timber</placeName>, viz: a <num value="42">42</num>-pounder, rifled and banded, an <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> columbiad, both of which had been struck at the reduction of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, an <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> seacoast howitzer, and a <num value="32">32</num>-pounder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The fort is only called on to recognize authorized boats passing, taking for granted that they have their officers aboard.
