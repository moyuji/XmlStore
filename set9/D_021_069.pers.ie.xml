<head>The course of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Since it became evident at a late period that the <name>Governments</name> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> had no earthly intention of interfering in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> quarrel, the question often suggests itself why the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> was so long permitted to remain in doubt on that subject, and actually to receive encouragement of the idea that her independence would be ultimately recognized by those Governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We are aware that the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, with that sagacity and decision which have placed him at the head of living <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> statesmen, has repeatedly urged the <rs>English Government</rs> to unite with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> in opening the blockade, but his overtures have been declined, until finally both nations, which act of late in concert upon all matters of common interest, in both hemispheres, have given us to understand, through the executive addresses of their respective Chiefs, that they intend to take no part in this quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It would have been more just and more humane if they had authoritatively and explicitly made this declaration at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, wording it in such language that by no possible misconstruction it could be tortured to mean anything but what it said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Nay, it would have been better for the <rs>South</rs> and more humane, if, as soon as it was heard abroad that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> had declared its independence, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> had both accepted the <rs>Federal</rs> theory of the <rs>Constitution</rs> as correct, and assumed that the <rs>Southern</rs> movement was a rebellion to which they could give no more countenance, aid, and comfort, in any way, than to a rebellion in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName>, or many of the other recognized provinces or possessions of any <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If they had taken this ground, the <rs>South</rs> would have expected nothing at their hands, and relying upon herself from the start, would have redoubled her energies.--But, instead of this, they began by assuming the <rs>Federal</rs> theory to be wrong, and the <rs>State Rights</rs> theory to be true, as they are, their journals produced powerful arguments to establish this proposition; their Governments acknowledged the <rs>South</rs> to be a belligerent power, and entitled, as such, to equal respect at the hands of other nations with the <rs>North</rs>, which they would never have done in the case of a mere rebellious province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The indications of an approaching acknowledgment of Southern independence were so numerous that, not only the <rs>South</rs>, but the <rs>North</rs>, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, were fully satisfied of a foregone conclusion in this minds of the <rs>Western Powers</rs> to interfere on the side of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The whole Northern press was unanimous in the expression of this sentiment, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, by its appropriation of <num value="7000000">seven millions</num> for coast fortifications, showed its conviction of the same apparently inevitable result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> correspondents abroad of Federal newspapers bore continued and emphatic testimony to the same effect, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ministers found their residences at the various courts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> so uncomfortable on account of the general hostility to their country, that they were all anxious to return home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>All this was the natural result of the moral aid and comfort which, from the very beginning, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> had thrown into the <rs>Southern</rs> scale, and which warranted the belief that the physical aid and comfort would not be far behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <name>English</name> press manufactures public opinion for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and sometimes for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and the press had steadily prepared the public mind of the world for the ultimate recognition of Southern Independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> At a late hour of the day, and before the intelligence of our late disasters had reached <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, the speech of the <rs>Queen</rs> and the address of the <rs>French Emperor</rs> suddenly and effectually put an extinguisher upon every expectation of that event, which the whole action of their Governments, and the public sentiment of their people, had warranted all mankind in anticipating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is unnecessary to say that the <rs>North</rs> was delighted with this unlooked for blessing, and the <rs>South</rs> for a time saddened and depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The transient gloom, however, has passed away, and she is beginning to realize that &#x0022;who would be free, themselves must strike the blow.&#x0022; She looks abroad no longer for aid or alliance, but she may at least be permitted to wonder why her hopes have been aroused only to be disappointed.--So far as <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> is concerned, the <rs>South</rs> has no peculiar cause of complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Her politic and wary ruler has not led the way publicly in holding out encouragement to the <rs>Southern</rs> movement, however he may have sought privately to enlist <name>English</name> co operation with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Nor has <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> at any time intermeddled with <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> concerns, nor in any way exerted her influence in attenuating the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States of the old <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><name>French</name> emissaries have never come to this continent for the purpose of setting the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> by the ears on the subject of slavery; there has been no <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName> in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, there have been no <persName n="Dukes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Dukes,nomatch:0"><surname>Dukes</surname></persName> and Duchesses to patronize runaway negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>When <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stowe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName> visited that city, instead of the ovation she received in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, she produced no sensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, on the contrary, has been the great Abolition power of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>She has been the &#x0022;<persName n="Genius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Genius,nomatch:0"><surname>Genius</surname></persName> of Universal Emancipation.&#x0022; There is no proposition in mathematics which can be more clearly demonstrated than that, for more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has employed the slavery, subject to divide and ruin her commercial and manufacturing rival, the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It was through her influence that the flame of Abolition fanaticism was kindled in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, which at last burned as under the cords of the former Union, and are now enveloping the whole land in their lurid blaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Having accomplished this result, it was natural to suppose that she would prepare to reap the fruits of her policy, and these fruits, we supposed, consisted in the acquisition of Southern staples and commerce, in her independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the overthrow of that power as a commercial and manufacturing rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It seems probable, however, that the rewards she propose for herself are of a more comprehensive character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There are those who believe that she will gladly permit the whole <rs>South</rs> to become a desert, so that the cotton production, the only point in which <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> has the advantage of her, may be destroyed, and by a monopoly of the cotton trade <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> may dominate over the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> <hi rend="italics">Fellow-Citizens of the <name>Senates</name> and <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>:</hi>--I recommend the adoption of a joint resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be substantially as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid to be used by such State in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> If the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval of Congress and the country, there is the end; but if it does command such approval, I seem it of importance that the <name>States</name> and people immediately interested should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so that they may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it. The Federal Government would find its highest interest in such a measure, as <num value="1">one</num> of the most efficient means of self- preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The leaders of the existing insurrection entertain the hope that this Government will be forced to acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected region, and that all the slave States north of such parts will then say &mdash; the <rs>Union</rs> for which we have struggled being already gone, we now choose to go with the <rs>Southern</rs> section. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> To deprive them of this hope substantially ends the rebellion, and the initiation of emancipation completely deprives them of it as to all the <name>States</name> initiating it. The point is not that all the <name>States</name> tolerating slavery would very soon, if at all, initiate emancipation; but that while the offer is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such initiation, make it certain to the more Southern that, in no event, will the former ever join the latter in their proposed Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>I say initiation, because, in my judgment, gradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all. In the mere financial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress, with the census tables and Treasury reports before him, can readily see for himself how very soon the current expenditures of this war would purchase, at fair valuation, all the slaves in any named State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> Such a proposition on the part of the <rs>General Government</rs> sets up no claim of a right, by Federal authority, to interfere with slavery within State limits, referring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject in each case to the <rs>State</rs> and its people immediately interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>In he annual message, last <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, I thought fit to say: The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>I said this not hastily, but deliberately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>War has been made, and continues to be an indispensable means to this end. A practical reacknowledgment of the national authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once cease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue, and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the ruin which may follow it. Such as may seem indispensable, or may obviously promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle, must and will come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The proposition now made is an offer only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I hope it may be esteemed no offence to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more value to the <name>States</name> and private persons concerned than are the institution and property in it, in the present aspect of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is recommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical results.--In full view of great responsibility to my <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and to my country.

<head>What constitutes a General?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> There seems to be a great diversity of opinion with regard to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/><num value="1">One</num> party insists upon it that nobody can be a great General who has not been educated at a military school, another, that such education is not necessary; <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, that it is absolutely injurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>We suspect that the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> class of disputants some nearer the truth than either of the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>That education at a military school, and the habits acquired thereby, are of great service to the officer, cannot, we think, he disputed with any show of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>But there is great danger, in making appointments, of trusting too much to that species of qualification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>A great General must be a great genius, and nobody but the <rs>Supreme Being</rs> can confer genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Most assuredly, schools and colleges cannot do it, although, in some instances, they may assist in its development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/><placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> did not make <persName n="Newton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Newton,nomatch:0"><surname>Newton</surname></persName> a great mathematician, or <placeName reg="Milton, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100426">Milton</placeName> a great post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The latter, he thought, would be too apt to be cramped and confined by precedents, technicalities, and the received traditions of the service, like the <rs>Earl</rs> of Cork, who, according to <persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName>, executed the most precise and beautiful man&#x0153;uvres, all faultless, according to the drill book, on the field of Almansa, and wound up by losing all his artillery, all his baggage, all his munitions of war, and <num value="13000">13,000</num> men out of <num value="25000">25,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>So much for technical routine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The danger is, that the pupils of a military school, unless they have genius enough to escape from its trammels, after a sufficient lapse of time spent in the army to bring them up to the grade of <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>, will become the slaves of the system, instead of using it as an instrument to accomplish their ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It was by breaking through all rules that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> overran <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> in <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure>, after destroying <num value="5">five</num> armies, each of them doubly as large as his own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> It has been contended that because we live in an age when steam and <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> play a very important part in warfare, the <rs>General</rs> must necessarily, therefore, be an educated man &mdash; must have received a military education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Let us see what young gentlemen are taught at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>: They study a course of mathematics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>They pass through <persName n="Newton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Newton,nomatch:0"><surname>Newton</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Principia</hi> isogamies to suit the advances of science in modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>They learn as much chemistry as can be taught in a winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>They are taught to construct a French book, (not to speak the language, we presume,) and they read <persName n="Jomini,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><surname>Jomini</surname></persName>'s Art of War. Besides this, they attend to the practical part of mathematics, engineering, surveying, descriptive geometry, &#x0026;c. They drill in all the arms, regularly, like a regiment in active services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Now, we should be sorry to think that all this could not be taught, and is not taught, at the <orgName n="University of Virginia" type="university">University of Virginia</orgName>, with the exception of the drill, as well and as thoroughly as it is taught at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Indeed, without intending any disparagement of the latter institution &mdash; for it is an excellent school &mdash; we would not be afraid to stake the pupils of the <rs type="place">University</rs>, selected according to our own pleasure, against the very best that <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> ever sent forth, the trial being confined to mathematics and the physical sciences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>As for the drill, it is notorious that there are many officers connected with our army, who never saw a military institution, who drill our troops as well as the very best that <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> has furnished us. A Drill-Sergeant can perform that duty better than the <rs>Duke</rs> of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> could have done it, the day before, or the day after, the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> We are told that &#x0022;war&#x0022; in the time of <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> and C&#x00E6;ear, &#x0022;was an art, not a science.&#x0022; It might have been added that it was so even in the time of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, at least he said it was. Nor do we see any reason to think that it is otherwise even now. Of all the pursuits of which we have any account, it is the least certain, and the most liable to fluctuations and reverses. &#x0022;The fortune of war&#x0022; has become a proverbial expression, indicative of the uncertainty of its results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Science may change and multiply the weapons of war; but when those changed or multiplied weapons are in the hands of both parties, and they are thereby thus far on an equality, genius plays as important a part in producing results as it did in the days of <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> and C&#x00E6;ear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>In this connexion, we may observe that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, who made more use of artillery than any other General had ever done before him, and who was accused by his detractors of undue partiality to that limb of the service, tells us that the art of war cannot be learned by studying systems of war, (he was commenting on <persName n="Jomini,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><surname>Jomini</surname></persName>'s book at the time, and a scathing commentary it is;) that the best school is the field &mdash; and that the next best is the campaigns of certain great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> whom he enumerates, viz; <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>, <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName>,</hi> and <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Julius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Julius,nomatch:0"><surname>Julius</surname></persName></hi> <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, in ancient times; in modern times <persName n="Adolphus,,Gustavus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="default:Adolphus,Gustavus,,,"><foreName>Gustavus</foreName> <surname>Adolphus</surname></persName>, <persName n="Turenne,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Turenne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Turenne</surname></persName>, <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Eugene</foreName></persName> of <placeName reg="Cluses, Haute-Savoie, Rhone-Alpes" key="tgn,7009045">Savoy</placeName>, and the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,2050078" n="1.000 4" reg="marlborough, middlesex county, massachusetts">Marlborough</placeName>, and <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It is evident that he thought something more than a mare knowledge of the manner in which <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> was to be managed was requisite to the constitution of a consummate General.

<head>The duty of each man.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/> It is the duty of every individual to give in times of peril, to his country, his whole power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>We do not except from this broad proposition neither age, sex nor condition.--Every person who cannot do so conscientiously and with a will, ought, in our judgment, to lease the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/> He who lives among us, enjoying equally the blessings of Government, should support it by whatever of resources he may possess, and, if need be, by periling his life upon the battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>We hold this course to be <num value="1">one</num> of imperative duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/> All men are not alike qualified for all the responsibilities which now press upon the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>But it is the bounden duty of each member of this and other communities to assume all that he is able to perform, and to seek only such position as he is qualified to fill, so that by economical arrangement of the powers of each the greatest total of results may be attained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/> Genuine and true patriotism is unselfish, and will never stand in the pathway of the utmost good to the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> ends and personal ambition always yield their appetite to the public interest and the general good of the country by the truly patriotic man. Our State is actually invaded by the enemy; our <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> has been unsuccessful; and there is actual want of money, of arms and munitions of war, and of more soldiers in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/> He who has money must contribute it; he who can increase, by labor or otherwise, arms and munitions of war, should act; and he who can bear arms should at once do so. Not <num value="1">one</num>, but every <num value="1">one</num> should inquire how, where, and in what way he can do most to give strength and power to his Government, to insure its prompt and certain success in its struggle for property, liberty and life! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/> The time has come when we must drive back the foe, or be overrun and degraded.--He who does not see and realize this issue is not to be envied for his penetration or his sagacity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/> The period has come when we must act &mdash; and he who now refuse to put forth his powers, whatever they may be, in support of this desperate and deadly struggle in behalf of his country, must be held either a &#x0022;lumberer of the ground&#x0022; he occupies, unworthy the name of a Southerner, and can be only placed as against us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>This will be the only safe calculation to make upon him who refuses now to aid and assist his fellows with all of his capabilities of character and of possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/> Nor can any be so dull and stupid as not to see that nothing less than our whole power can by relied upon for success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>With the exertion of our entire strength we can repel the invader form our State; and we shall then exhibit the spirit of heroism which cannot fail to dispel the illusion form the enemy's mind that a large portion of our people are false to the <rs>South</rs>, ignorant of their own interests, insensible of their duty, and fit subjects for Northern rule and dominion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/> We assume that the whole power of our country is demanded; that it is the duty of each member of the whole to exert his own powers, so that the greatest results may be achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>He who fails to act, falls short of duty, of interest, and patriotism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/> It is the duty and interest of each <num value="1">one</num> at this juncture to enter the army and to stand by the <rs>Government</rs> that seeks to secure to her citizens property, liberty and life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>We are all in the same boat, and we must perish or live as <num value="1">one</num> man.
