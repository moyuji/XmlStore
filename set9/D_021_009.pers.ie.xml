<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The longer the civil war in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> lasts, the more evident becomes the signs that it is brutalizing at least <num value="1">one</num> of the combatants.--If we had opportunities of watching the deeds of the <rs>Confederates</rs> as closely as we follow those of the <rs>Federals</rs>, we might possibly find that the progress towards savage vengeance is not very unequal in both parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>So far, however, as events have publicly transpired, <hi rend="italics">it is the <rs>North</rs> which is growing fierce and bloodthirsty; it is the high professing Puritians who threaten to murder in cold blood; it is the citizens of New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, claiming credit for civilization and literary to see, who are exulting in the commission of wanton destruction.</hi> War is terrible enough at best, but even war has its mitigations among civilized men. We do not in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> when we take a city out the throats of all the women and children, as the <name>Taipings</name> have done in <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>; neither do we burn down the city and sow salt upon the site, as was sometimes done even in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in barbarous days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We do not torture our prisoners after the manner described in <persName n="Cooper,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s redskin novels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>As civilized and <name>Christian</name> men, we put some bridle over the worst instincts of our animal nature, even in our moments of most intense excitement.--There are things we are ashamed to do in the heat of conflict, and we count that man a mere villain who when there is no fight raging can enjoy revenge without danger and can feel a ferocious joy in the infliction of suffering. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> There are bad signs in the recent news from <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Already have the <rs>Northern Government</rs> threatened to hang up all the prisoners they may take at sea, and already have they filled prisons with condemned victims, whom they boast that they are about to put to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><hi rend="italics">It is quite clear, according to all laws, Divine and human, that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> have no more right to hang these men after taking them prisoners at sea than they have to hang any prisoners they take on land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It would be murder to do so.</hi> But we much fear that this crime would have already been committed if it had depended solely upon the will of the <rs>Northern Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The Southerners, however, also have prisoners, and prisoners of note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>They have chosen from them by lot a number equal to that of the seamen threatened, who are to undergo the same hardships and to endure the same fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Here are the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steps taken towards a fiendish emulation in human sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Meantime the <num value="2">two</num> sets of prisoners are tortured by comfortless dungeons, hard usage, and prison diet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> takes another eager step forward in this downward path, and addresses the <rs>President</rs> to inflict the torture of condemned cells and starvation upon the captives taken from under the <rs>British</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Of course, this would be but a signal for a farther retaliation, and would but send other officers of the <rs>Northern</rs> army into close confinement in the prisons of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is a game of torture, the <rs>North</rs> leading off and the <rs>South</rs> following suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Up to the present moment no actual murder has been committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We may, however, expect every day to hear that some <num value="1">one</num> of these prisoners has died under the hardships he is enduring, and that a prisoner on the other side has been publicly hanged to revenge his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If this dreadful play of death for death is once begun, it must go on till the prisons are emptied on both sides, and the war between the <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo-Saxon</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> will be like a war of cannibals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Again, there are limits to the rights of destruction which even a nation at war may exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We read in <persName n="Grotius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grotius,nomatch:0"><surname>Grotius</surname></persName>, and other writers <sic>apon</sic> the state of war and peace, that all people who deserve the name of a nation have in all times respected things which are beneficial to the whole human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Thus there is a rule derived from the authority of Holy Writ that fruit trees shall be spared wherever found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The implements of the husbandman have also been held sacred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><hi rend="italics">To conquer, and not to destroy, is the right of a beligerent nation of civilized beings.</hi> Yet we are told, with a dastardly exultation, that fleets have gone forth from New London and New Bedford, laden not with soldiers and arms, but with stones; and that these fleets, <q>&#x0022;with their stony burthens scuttled broadside, have obliterated, for years to come, the channels of entry by sea to those cursed cities, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> The object is to strangle these great ports of commerce; not to repossess them, but to destroy them for all time.

<head>The furlough and bounty System.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/> We have received several letters from volunteers relative to the law recently passed by Congress granting a furlough and bounty to soldiers re-enlisting for the war. There seems to be a willingness to continue in the service of the county, though it is but just is say that the proposed bounty of <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> is the least among the considerations by which they are influenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>This, however, is not the case with the furloughs; and indeed it is natural that men who have been for a long time in the service should eagerly embrace an opportunity to see their homes and kindred, while we take it that the same patriotic impulses which induced their original enlistment would incite them to struggle on until they are blessed with the reflection that those homes are safe from the infernal purposes of the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The law, as passed by Congress, is liable to criticism in respect is the proposed furloughs; for instance, the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">second section</orgName>, which seems to have created a good deal of sensation in the camps, reads as follows: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> &#x0022;That furloughs, not exceeding <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, with transportation home and back, shall be granted to all <num value="12">twelve</num>-months men now in service who shall, prior to the expiration of <unclear></unclear> present term of service, volunteer or enlist for the next <num value="2">two</num> ensuing years subsequent to the expiration of their present term of service, or for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> or the war; said furloughs to be issued at such times and in such numbers as the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> may deem most compatible with the public <unclear></unclear>; <hi rend="italics">the length of each furlough being regulated with reference to the distance of each volunteer <unclear> his </unclear>.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/> Since our attention has been called to this <unclear></unclear> we have endeavored to seek a satisfactory explanation of the portion italicized, but in vain; and we do not wonder that it has puzzled the volunteers, with whom it is now the all-absorbing topic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>The furlough cannot exceed <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, but it may be for any time less than that; yet, says the act, <q>&#x0022;it must be regulated with reference to the distance of each volunteer from his home.&#x0022;</q> It can hardly be supposed that any soldier would be willing to take the shorter furlough, yet the language certainly implies such a supposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The author treats all the subjects growing out of the slavery dispute with an acuteness of analysis and a grace of style that give a wonderful freshness to subjects which have been hackneyed by other writers, and has produced in the whole a popular and graceful exposition of Southern political philosophy.&#x0022;</q> </p>
