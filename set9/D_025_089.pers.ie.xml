<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> Having recently come to this county, I propose to give some account of my trip for the benefit of your readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>You are aware that the cars now run only to <persName n="Milton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Milton,nomatch:0"><surname>Milton</surname></persName>, which makes some <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> more of staging to <placeName reg="Lewisburg, Greenbrier, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118933">Lewisburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Nevertheless <num value="1">one</num> can make the trip from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> &mdash; by way of the <rs>Bath Alum</rs> and the <name>Warm</name>, Hot, and <placeName key="tgn,2112197" n="1.000 1" reg="healing springs, bath, virginia">Healing Springs</placeName> &mdash; in <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>. These watering-places, and especially the <num value="1">one</num> from which this letter hails, present, as you may suppose, a striking contrast to their appearance before the war. Then, even out of the springs season, they afforded evidence of the gay crowds which had but lately thronged them; now, they vie with the surrounding mountains in a solitude which is painfully oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>For a couple of days the <rs type="place">Hot Springs</rs> was an exception to this remark, being the scene of a large sale of personal property, the premises having recently changed hands at the price of <measure n="200000dollars" type="currency">$200,000</measure>. On this occasion bidders were present from the region around and even from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and furniture was sold at fabulous prices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> The mere springs-goer, who frequents these watering-places to escape the heat of the lower country, to whirl in a fashionable throng, or to use the healing waters, whatever other object he may secure, cannot fully appreciate the true beauty and glory of mountain scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>To do this <num value="1">one</num> must spend the <date value="10-01">first days of October</date> amid the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Then, and then alone, do those grim piles attire themselves with a gorgeousness which might befit an Easter a queen.--For man to die is to become loathsome, but Nature is most beautiful in her dying hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>And this is specially true in the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Certainly nowhere else is the autumnal foliage so varied and so glorious in its hues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Whether it is due to the peculiarity of the trees or of the climate, I do not know; but though I have often in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> enjoyed the scenery of autumn, I have never witnessed such glories as now surround me. Yonder is a tree which is not unlike a large bouquet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Its symmetrical form is varied with emerald, and golden, and purple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Methinks a giant need not desire a better bouquet to present to his lady-love; but he must be a huge <num value="1">one</num>, indeed, for the tree towers with a majesty scarcely inferior to its brilliant beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>And look at you mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>It is a wall of foliage of every hue, and looks as if dressed with myriad flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Well may the clouds be excused that they have come and nestled so lovingly on its crest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>At every turn you have a scene the same, and yet new. I am but a poor word painter, but he who has painted these mountains has varied and ample colors, and has made such pictures as to be appreciated must be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>How lavish the power which creates such scenes in these solitudes, and to pass away even while <num value="1">one</num> gazes at them in wonder and admiration ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> As I passed the scene of the <rs>Dry</rs> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> fight, I could see in the trees and houses and fences the evidences of its spirited character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>A very intelligent lady at the tollgate, who witnessed the whole, showed us where the different forces were stationed, and described the events with considerable navaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>From the accounts of prisoners the intention of the enemy was to destroy the <rs>White Sulphur</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>You will perceive how narrow was the escape when I tell you that the enemy had advanced from <persName n="Callaghan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Callaghan,nomatch:0"><surname>Callaghan</surname></persName>'s, blockading the road behind, and had gotten within a mile of Dry <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, when our troops came into the turnpike at Dry <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> by the <rs>Anthony</rs>'s <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> road, quite unaware that the enemy were in such close proximity.--Had they been a few moments later the enemy would have passed, and probably would have accomplished their fiendish purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>As it is, a few of them are here as wounded prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Everybody out here expresses chagrin at the escape of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>They had to open the road which they had blockaded, their ammunition was exhausted, they were weary and dispirited, fully expected to be captured, and had a white flag ready to haul up at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approach of our men. Every <num value="1">one</num> is asking why <persName n="Imboden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><surname>Imboden</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wharton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Wharton,nomatch:0"><surname>Wharton</surname></persName> did not come up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> I have been out as far as the <rs>Blue Sulphur</rs>, the seat of a new college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It escaped the ravages of the enemy who visited it, but has been sadly injured by some of our own troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Notwithstanding the main building had been burnt the year before the war, <persName n="French,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="nearbymention:French,Seth,B.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>French</surname></persName> suffered his cavalry to burn fences, negro cabins, the flooring from the pavilion over the spring, and even the rails of a large number of bedsteads, the posts being used to picket the horses with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Such wanton destruction of the property of a suffering institution of learning cannot be too severely reprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>I am glad to know that the <rs>General</rs> commanding is determined to put the seal of condemnation of such conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I learn that it is proposed during the war to pay for the property, and have the institution ready to go into operation when peace comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/><persName n="Walton,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Walton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev. Mr.</roleName> <surname>Walton</surname></persName> is now prosecuting successfully in <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124364">Greenbrier</placeName> an agency for the college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>You are probably aware that <persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> earnestly recommended the <rs>Blue</rs> as the seat of a great <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> College. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> I have been exceedingly gratified at the spirit of this people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>There may be some <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> in <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124364">Greenbrier</placeName>, but they are in a miserable moral and numerical minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>On the other hand, the loyal citizens are erect with hope and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>I asked a good many what they thought of the new State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The reply generally was, &#x0022;It is impossible.&#x0022; <num value="2">Two</num> officers, at different times, used substantially this language: &#x0022;Were a peace declared which recognized the division of the <rs>State</rs>, the fighting would still go on. I would still fight for my home and my freedom.&#x0022; Noble sentiment, say I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Never must <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> consent to her own dismemberment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Never must she give up the coal, and oil, and iron, and salt, and the rivers with which <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Then were she indeed shorn of her strength and glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The idea is preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>We must prevail, or be overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>If we are overcome we lose everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>If we succeed we will claim our own. I am thankful that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have thus declared, and specially am I proud that she who has suffered most has the least thoughts of abating her claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The people, too, are waked up on the subject of resisting raids, and I venture the prediction that if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> again penetrate this country they will not only meet a stern, organized resistance, but be bush whacked as they never have been before during the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> Fruit through this region is abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The soldiers here can have for the gathering what those in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> could not buy for their wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Everywhere <num value="1">one</num> sees the loaded apple trees, and witnesses the operations of cider-making and boiling apple butter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Nor will these sweet- toothed farmers suffer from the <rs n="Fall of Vicksburg" type="battle">fall of Vicksburg</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>They have their apple molasses, their maple sugar, and their Sorghum, and it is indeed pleasant to see them thus cheerfully and earnestly returning to the simple, self-reliant habits of their forefathers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> I have noticed and admired <num value="1">one</num> feature in the relations between the army and the people here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The soldiers, to a very great extent, are employed by the citizens at liberal wages to do their farm work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>This has been a great accommodation to the latter and a great benefit to the public, in the present scarcity of labor and of provisions, while to the soldiers it has afforded a relief from the annul of camp life, and has supplied many of the comforts and pleasures of home, <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> Possibly some soldiers from other regions might sneer at this; but I confess I like it, and think that <num value="1">one</num> of these heroes of many battles, devoting a leisure interval to the useful and peaceful culture of the soil, might adopt as his appropriate seal the figure of an expanding between a plough and an a liar with the words &#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">paratus ulra.</hi></foreign>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> Prodigies still abound in <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124364">Greenbrier</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>I met the other day a lady who was sanguine of an early peace, and gave as her reason a large while flag which had been seen in the heavens.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> The national debt &mdash; what is it now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Who can tell ?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> But this frightful sum total does not include all the liabilities of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>I see in the newspapers of the day other items mentioned, namely: <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> certificates of indebtedness; quartermasters' vouchers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>These and many other items constitute a floating debt, most of which is not embraced in the above financial statement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Some idea of the magnitude of the business of settling army paymasters' accounts may be inferred from the fact that over <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> clerks are employed upon them at the office of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> auditor, yet, with all this force, there is a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num>'s accumulations of accounts and claims in that office. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> If we add to the above statement all the liabilities incurred for war purposes since the <date value="06-30">30th of June,</date> and claims for damages, pensions, bounties, &#x0026;c., we will not overstate the total liabilities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at the present time at <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> is about <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the &#x0022;Union as it was.&#x0022; Her proportion of the national debt is, therefore, <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>But if we impoverish and destroy the <rs>South</rs>, depopulate her cities, her towns, and her plantations, the proportion of the debt to <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> will be increased <num value="0.5">fifty per cent.</num>, making her liabilities for the war <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The expenses of the <rs>General Government</rs>, for all purposes, at the present time, exceed <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of dollars per day; that is at the rate of <num value="700000000">seven hundred millions</num> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The internal revenue tax now levied is estimated at <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It is very doubtful whether that amount will be collected; but, whether it is or not, these figures will show what an immense increase every month and every year of war will make to the above-mentioned enormous amount of liabilities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> The debt is now represented by a mere promise to pay, but it is payable in money, which the <rs>Constitution</rs> recognizes to be <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>It will increase our understanding of the amount of the money I have named when we consider the weight of those amounts in <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The debt is now say <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars; this in <rs n="gold coin" type="product">gold coin</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would weigh <num value="3875">three thousand eight hundred and seventy-five</num> tons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>(A ton of gold weighs about <measure n="3685l." type="pounds"><num value="3685">3,685</num> pounds</measure>) To move this amount on an ordinary road would require <num value="3885">3,885</num> horses, or <num value="921">921</num> wagons with <num value="4">four</num> horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Silver weighs about <num value="15">fifteen</num> times as much as gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It would, therefore, require a greater force, in that proportion, to move the above amount, if estimated in that metal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>How much these amounts would weigh in paper, which has no intrinsic value, I have no means of calculating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> The valuation of the property, real and personal, in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, as fixed by the revenue board of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, is <num value="596000000">five hundred and ninety-six millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The ascertained and registered debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> on the <date value="06-30">30th of June</date> last, alone, with out reference to other debts and liabilities, is nearly twice as great as the whole value of the assessed property in this Commonwealth ! If we include the estimated debts before referred to, including claims for damages, etc., etc., we then have a debt more than <num value="4">four</num> times the value of the property of all kinds in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, as returned by the assessors to the county commissioners. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> --The man who does not take a cheerful view of our affairs, so far as the war is concerned, at the present moment, must have something very much the matter with his liver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We see no hope for him, now that the season is over at the <rs type="place">White Sulphur Springs</rs>, regarding him as so far gone that it is hardly worth while to consult a doctor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>There are others, indeed, who seeing will not perceive, and who hearing will not hearken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>To these we cannot apply the same advice that we should give to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-mentioned class, viz: to get their liver right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>They are of the class of <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,John,,,:1"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, surnamed Didymiums &mdash; they doubt of malice aforethought &mdash; they are determined not to believe, and believe they will not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are hard pushed for recruits to fill their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Of that there can be no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The draft of <num value="450000">450,000</num> produced but the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> part of that number.

They enlisted in great numbers at the beginning of the war, because business was at a stand, and they could find no other means of supporting existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Now there is plenty of work and they can do better by staying at home.
