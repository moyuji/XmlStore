<head>Correspondence.<lb/>a plan for raising a navy.</head> 
<div4 type="letter" n="1"> 
<head rend="italics">To the <name>Editors</name> of the <name>Dispatch</name>:</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> I see that a proposition has been made by some gentleman to raise by subscription the sum <measure n="100000000dollars" type="currency">$100,000,000</measure> for the purpose of purchasing a navy from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This is the same proposition, only upon a larger scale, that and already been made in relation to gunboats, except that the latter were to be constructed by ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> That we must have a navy has at last become apparent to every man and woman in the land, and in order to render the service which such an arm of our defence is intruded to render, it is also equally apparent that it must be had as soon as human agency can produce it. With the exception of the single battle of <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName>, where a blunder was the cause of our disaster, in no solitary instance have the enemy beaten us, where their navy was not a powerful auxiliary which we were latterly incapable of meeting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> That our seamen are not less <persName n="Valliant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Valliant,nomatch:0"><surname>Valliant</surname></persName> and skillful than their, has been made so manifest that even the enemy confers it; and could this powerful arm of their service be promptly met by <num value="1">one</num> of equal power, there is not a doubt that their armies would be driven from every foot at Southern soil in less than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, when, by a vigorous prosecution of the war by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, it might be carried <q>&#x0022;into <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> and the enemy be made to feel some of its honors, of which they are as yet totally igucraut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>As the advantage of, and necessity for, and navy are however, too apparent to need any demonstration, and as its speedy creation is absolutely indispensable to secure the good to result from it, it is the duty of <hi rend="italics">Somebody</hi> who loves the <rs>South</rs> and wishes to secure her independence to put his whole soul in the work, and prove heaven and earth for its certain and speedy consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Viewing the matter in this light, while I applaud the patriotic intention of the above scheme, it is to my mind absolutely certain that it will never work-- <hi rend="italics">that a navy will never be created by subscription.</hi> I therefore propose as a substitute for the above plan the following: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It is well known that there are <num value="1000">thousands</num> of wealthy men in the <rs>South</rs>--men who not only count their dollars by the hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, but by the <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is also equally well known &mdash; I, say it with profound mortification &mdash; that many of these wealthy Southrons have not contributed a dollar to the prosecution of the war; neither have they raised an arm in the defence of our bleeding and much wronged country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In such a struggle as this &mdash; a struggle of right against might; a struggle which convaises our fair land from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, and deprives many a family of the strong arm of their natural protector; in such a struggle, those who are not for us are against us. While our brave men in the field are standing as a wall of steel between the possessions of the wealthy men and the despoiling hand of the enemy, these non-combatants are doing nothing to keep them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They live at home, read the daily journals, comment on the movements of <q>&#x0022;our troops,&#x0022;</q> and speculate as to the alarming possibility that the enemy may penetrate into the country, in which event they would lose their possessions &mdash; but give nothing to aid in driving the enemy back ! We have no use for such people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A man who will not be true to his country, who will make no sacrifice for her good, will be true to nothing; he is really. </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;A wretch devoid of use of cause, of grace; </l><l>The insolent tensut of encumbered space.&#x0022; </l> </lg> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Now, it seems to me that the <rs>South</rs>, with a population of <num value="8000000">eight million</num> inhabitants, must contain as least <num value="100000">100,000</num> persons whose property of all sorts will average in value the sum of <measure n="50000dollars" type="currency">$50,000</measure>. Let <placeName reg="Congress pass">Congress pass</placeName> a law imposing a direct tax of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> upon all persons the assessed value of whose property is equal to that sum, and an additional tax of <num value="0.02">two per centum</num> upon all property whose assessed value exceeds <measure n="50000dollars" type="currency">$50,000</measure>. Let this tax be levied at once, and the sheriffs of every county, town, and city in the <rs>South</rs>, not in possession of the enemy, he required immediately to make returns of the names of all persons coming under the operations of this law. Let an order be issued immediately thereafter for the return into the <rs>Confederate Treasury</rs>, <hi rend="italics">in specie,</hi> of the amount liable, under such law, to be paid by such persons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> This special taxation may <unclear></unclear> to as oppressive and unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The suspension of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> also see us a subversion of our rights; but it is <num value="1">one</num> of those measures which the necessities of the times command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Many things are done and submitted to when danger threatens, which at no other time would be for a moment entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But, should such action on the part of the <rs>Congress</rs> seem odious, in order to make it less so, let the <rs>Government</rs> issue indemnifying bonds as a pledge that <sic>that</sic>which the necessities of the times imperatively demand shall be wrested from those who <hi rend="italics">will not</hi> of themselves contribute, shall be returned to them at some future and convenient season. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> It will be seen that the minimum sum thus obtained will be <measure n="100000000dollars" type="currency">$100,000,000</measure>; what the maximum will be I. cannot conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This will give us <num value="100">100</num> good ships of war, estimating that each ship will cost <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">$1,000,000</measure>. With this navy we could open our ports to the world, and make this an aggressive instead of a defensive war, which is the only course by which we can hope to conquer a peace from a ruthless and powerful foe. The money can be raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The ships can be bought while we are going through the long and fatal preliminaries of getting ready a few gunboats by subscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>With the aid of such a navy, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can give us no blow which we cannot return with interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Foreign nations will thus be taught that we are a power amongst the empires of the earth, which they will never confess unless they are forced to. This attained, the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, with an exhausted treasury, an over whelming debt, and a people clamorous for peace, will be glad to cease postilides, and it will then rest with us alone to terminate this terrible war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> If this plan for promptly and efficiently raising a navy were adopted by the <rs>Government</rs>, no good man, no true <persName><foreName>Southerner</foreName></persName>, could object to it. The <rs>Lincoln</rs> of have already avowed their intention to confiscate all property in the <rs>South</rs> for the purpose of paying the expenses of the war. If they succeed in overrunning us, they will most assuredly carry out their threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>No true man among us will own a collar's worth of property, and if our Government were even to go so far as to take into their hands the temporary guardianship of all the property in the <rs>South</rs>, and use it at their pleasure, it would be no more than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> mean to do; with this great difference; that by the judicious use of such means as a temporary usurpation of power would place in the hands of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, the enemy would be repelled, and property owners would, after the war, remain in undisturbed possession, with the assurance of remuneration for all damages sustained at the hands of the <rs>Government</rs> necessarily inflicted for the public good. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> During a period of perfect peace all citizens must pay for the protection of their property by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Surely, at such a time as this, the necessity of aiding the <rs>Government</rs> must be more than ever apparent; and as the expense in affording that protection is greatly increased, so should be proportionately increased the contributions from the individual objects of their fostering care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It is simply a <hi rend="italics">quod pro quo,</hi> and, as I have already said, so well-wisher of his country can complain if such increase of contribution is executed of him. By the adoption of this measure those who are willing to aid the cause will do so cheerfully; those who will not, and yet claim protection, will be forced to do so. If this proposition be a good <num value="1">one</num>, I sincerely trust that Congress will adopt it, whether it be morally, physically, or constitutionally right or wrong Extraordinary disease require extraordinary remedies. </p> <closer> <signed rend="smallcaps">A Volunteers</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> The crisis is upon us. Our own homes are invited by a savage foe. Our husbands and brothers are fighting and bleeding for our safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We will arouse our-selves, and, girding on the armor of patriotism and the breast-plate of faith in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we will march to our country's rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The lands must be tilled and bread and meat raised, as well as clothes prepared for our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Many who have hitherto been ignorant of spinning, weaving, and knitting, are now learning; and many others, some or whose fingers were wont to move gracefully over the keys of the plane, now express a willingness to wield the hoe in the cornfield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>And let not our enemies sheer at the idea; <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> the same power which gave us brave hearts will give us strong arms to do our duty. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Her busy hands her cheering words, and handevoted heart, have nerved those she loved to herds of noble daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Nor will we be behind our sisters of other untions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Not only will we labor with our own hands, but we will patiently suffer and make whatever sacrifice our country demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Those who have means will contribute freely towards building war volsella and to the pecessitles of those in distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Even the <name>Procious</name> jewels and plate will be contributed, if she authorities but Latinate that they are necessary to the safety of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>And if it should fall to our lot to see our homes about to be desecrated by the unhallowed feet of the ruthless enemy, our hands will apply the torch to all he would prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Yes, we will go forth destitute of all but pure brave hearts; and, trusting in the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Heaven, we will die and be at rest, rather than submit to the de grading yoke of those who would conquer us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> All these things will we do; but they are not our strong forte; we will pray without ceasing for our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>We will importune the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of battles to prosper our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We will pray that our soldiers may be kept from sin. We will pray that our people may forsake wickedness.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/> --The care of our soldiers' health is among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most pressing and sacred duties of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Every consideration of patriotism, interest, and humanity, demands that this duty should be scrupulously and rigidly discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Nothing can excuse any dereliction in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>It is a part of every officer's duty to look constantly to the health of his men. We fear that this has been too much overlooked in some quarters, and we feel sure that me valuable lives have been sacrificed which might have been saved if greater and more systematic provisions had been made to supply our soldiers with proper food in season, and to have it properly cooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Warm weather is rapidly approaching, and we may well look for a large increase of disease and death, in consequence, in our armies, unless prompt attention is given to this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/> We suggested months ago that our soldiers should be spared the drudgery of cooking for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>There is no necessity for it, and the worst consequences result from it. In the first place, it is subjecting them to the performance of menial services from which they ought to be exempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>They are naturally unfitted for it, do it with reluctance, and do it, therefore, badly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>It is the business of servants, not of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>In the next place, the cooking which they are compelled to do will be done in the quickest, easiest, and worst manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/> The food thus prepared can only be digested by stomach that are proof against <num value="10">ten</num>-penny nails and camphene whiskey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Ordinary powers of digestion will succumb to its resistance; and the result, in a word, will be, as experience demonstrates it is, that the hospitals become crowded, many men who manage to keep up will be weak and inefficient, a burden rather than a benefit to the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/> Thirdly, there is not, as we before remarked, the least necessity for it. We have servants for cooks, who understand the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>In portions of our country which the enemy has temporarily overrun, many citizens have been compelled to remove with their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>The latter are now idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of them could not doubt be obtained as cooks for a moderate compensation, and they could thus be made to render important services to the cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/> Banish camphene whiskey and every other brain-poisoner from the army, absolutely and forever, and supply it with a plenty of food and good cooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The <num value="1">one</num> will save officers and men a perfect sea of trouble disaster, and ignominy, and the other will contribute powerfully to the health and comfort, and, therefore, to the efficiency of our soldiers and to the success of our cause.--<hi rend="italics"><persName n="Bulletin,,New Orleans,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="default:Bulletin,New Orleans,,,"><foreName>New Orleans</foreName> <surname>Bulletin</surname></persName>.</hi> </p> </div3>

At least that is the supposition, as <num value="1">one</num> of his comrades saw him fall upon the field of conflict, and he has not been heard of since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> twin brothers, both of whom were in that fierce and bloody fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>He was a youth of noble impulses, manly character, and had been educated at the best schools, completing his education at the <orgName n="Military Institute" type="institute">Military Institute</orgName> at <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington, Va.</placeName>, He entered the war at its commencement, and had endured its privations and sacrifices until he sealed his devotion to his beloved country with his blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Noble boy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>he was a hero in the strife. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/> But our object is not so much to pay a feeble tribute or respect to the memory and exalted worth of this gallant youth, as to refer to the influence which his death had upon the rest of his brothers, <num value="3">three</num> of whom still survive him. <num value="2">Two</num> of them &mdash; his twin brother and an elder brother &mdash; were already in the field, whilst another had not yet gone forth to war. This brother, when it was announced to him that <persName><foreName>Nathaniel</foreName></persName> was slain, instantly remarked that he would take his place, and is already with <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00254" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName>&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,H.,R.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> to avenge his country's wrongs and his brother's death. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/> --Since many of our ladies seem to think that the present <q>&#x0022;coal scuttle&#x0022;</q> style had its origin in the sunny <rs>South</rs>, they may be somewhat enlightened by the perusal of the following which we cut from a late Northern newspaper: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/> <hi rend="italics">A Woman's Thoughts on Bonnets.</hi>--The bonnet is the frame to the picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>A pretty face wants the setting to add lustre to its loveliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>A homely <num value="1">one</num> hopes, by a happy combination of tints, to soften its ugliness, or to suggest a beauty which it does not posses.--The present bonnets look line <rs n="coal scuttle" type="product">coal scuttles</rs>, and will hardly succeed in making any <num value="1">one</num> look handsomer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>In their anxiety to grow large all of a sudden, they have burst out behind as well as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>They may be decidedly stylish, but they are not graceful.-- A high-pointed shelf, protruding over the forehead, and a bag of lace hanging out of the crown, large enough for a work-pocket, is anything but artistic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Still, it is refreshing to see heads crowned with flowers, instead of feathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>To me there was always an incongruity in the thought of robbing poor ostriches and smaller birds of their pretty tails, in order to trick out feminine heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>But flowers are a natural ornament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Doubtless <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> things which Eve did was to depot flowers in her hair, and to this day flowers and rare imitations of flowers make the most simple and beautiful adorning of her multiplied daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The most graceful spring hat worn is the simple straw, (void of the silk or lace crown,) trimmed with budded green, or violet tints, and clusters of spring flowers. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
