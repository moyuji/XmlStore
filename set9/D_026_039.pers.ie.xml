<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> With equal clearness of insight, the great departed patriot detected the weak points of the enemy, and the most efficient mode of operating upon their intense selfishness.--They had long represented the <rs>Southern</rs> people as high-tempered, ferocious, and bullying race, who could only be controlled by fighting them as men would fight wolves and tigers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>When they found the <rs>South</rs>, in the face of the most unparalleled outrages, steadily refusing to retaliate, they ascribed it at once to cowardice and redoubled their atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>They scouted the idea that the <rs>South</rs> held back from committing the same crimes as themselves on account of her higher tone of morality, justice, and benevolence, for these were precisely the qualities which they had been always taught to believe she never possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>And so, safe from any possibility of punishment, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> went on, robbing, murdering, torturing, and so they intend to go on to the bitter end, just as <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00270" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> saw from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they would do, unless the <rs>Black Flag</rs> they have been really fighting under from the beginning was met by a Black Flag our side. </p>
