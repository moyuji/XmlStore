<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> Neither of these cases, however, exactly resembles this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The acts in question concerned the neutrality of <num value="2">two</num> feeble nations, as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baden-Wurttemberg" key="tgn,1038098">Baden</placeName> then were, and they were the acts of the <num value="2">two</num> most formidable powers (the <num value="1">one</num> on land the other on sea) then in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> contended for the right of search for nearly <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The exercise of this right was always a subject of bitter jealousy to every other civilized nation of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It was that, fully as much as the sword of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> that at <num value="1">one</num> time united the continent against her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>She has not to this day, we believe, formally abandoned the claim; but of late years she has formally waived it whenever the occasion demanded it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The most significant out-giving of their plans which we have yet seen, is the official dispatch of <persName n="Dupont,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Dupont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Dupont</surname></persName> to his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> The Government having determined to seize and occupy <num value="1">one</num> or more important points upon our Southern coast, where our squadrons might find shelter, possess a depot, and afford protection to loyal citizens, committed to my discretion the selection from among those places which I thought most available and desirable for those purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> After mature deliberation, aided by the president knowledge and goss loyalist <unclear>...</unclear> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> tary expedition had been extended, to which you have called my attention, I came to the conclusion that the original intention of the department, if <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> carried out, would fall short of the expectations of the country and of the capabilities of the expedition, while <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, I thought, would meet both in a high degree. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> I therefore submitted to <persName n="Sherman,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, commanding the military part of the expedition, this modification of our earliest matured plans, and had the satisfaction to receive his full concurrence, though he and the commander of the brigades very justly laid great stress on the necessity, if possible, of getting this frigate into the harbor of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> The meaning of these paragraphs is not very obvious to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of them, the writer seems to have been instructed to seize and occupy <q>&#x0022;<num value="1">one</num> or more&#x0022;</q> forts for <hi rend="italics">naval</hi> depots and shelters, which, while serving these purposes for blockading squadrons would also afford asylums for that imaginary class of people at the <rs>South</rs> who are supposed to desire the protection of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> This seems to have been the <q>&#x0022;original intention&#x0022;</q> of the squadron, an intention which was confined exclusively to the seizure and establishment of a <hi rend="italics">naval</hi> depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>If this original intention had been adhered to, we are left to infer that some other port than that of <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> would have been seized upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But subsequently to the adoption of the original plan, the naval expedition had swollen to very large proportions, and had come to embrace a military as well as naval feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The plan was then modified; and the object then was to seize upon a port which, while subserving the purposes of a naval depot and place of shelter, would also constitute a favorable point of landing for the large military force on board of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>In view of this double design, the <q>&#x0022;original intention of the department,&#x0022;</q> which looked merely to a naval depot, was made to yield to a plan which would accomplish <q>&#x0022;both&#x0022;</q> intentions at the same time; to wit: the landing of the military force and the establishment of a naval depot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> The seizure of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, the <rs>Commodore</rs> thinks, <q>&#x0022;meets both&#x0022;</q> the intentious of his Government <q>&#x0022;in a high degree;&#x0022;</q> and we are to infer that <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> is to be a point at which the <rs>Northern</rs> land forces are to disem&#x0022; bark in large numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>This part of the programme, however, does not seem to be executed with alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The advices which we receive from that point have not yet indicated any considerable landing of forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It may be that those which were on board the fleet at the attack on <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Forts Walker</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2096117" n="1.000 4" reg="lands end, beaufort, south carolina">Beauregard</placeName>, are destined for some other point at which a naval depot is to be established, and a military force landed; for it has been announced that a large part of the fleet has proceeded Southward, leaving in <placeName reg="Port Royal harbor">Port Royal harbor</placeName> the <term type="ship">flag ship</term> <rs type="ship">Wabash</rs> and enough other vessels-of-war to <unclear></unclear> the place and cover the landing of military forces to be sent down from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>In a few weeks it is probable that a very considerable force will be landed it <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>, and it Dehooves our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> meantime to turn every moment into account for rendering their invasion of the interior from <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> as difficult and impracticable as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> What other port is sought by the portion of the fleet that has proceeded South from <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>, is as yet a matter of mere surmise.--The chances are at least very strong that it is some port on the <rs type="place">Gulf coast</rs>, probably <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>; the design being to cut off communication with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and to prevent the possibility of any shipment of cotton by that circuitous road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Other advantages would of course result from establishing military and naval forces at that point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> From these places of rendezvous, it is their purpose no doubt to keep up a series of demonstrations along the whole seaboard, in the hope of discontenting our people with the detention of so strong an army at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and to effect the breaking up of that army by the force of popular clamor in the <name>States</name> from which that army is drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>In this object they will be quite mistaken; and as for their accomplishing anything by seizing ports on the seaboard, we certainly have no reason to apprehend much danger, after their failure to invade from the <rs>Potomac</rs> and from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, which are nearer to their sources of supply and which they have held from the beginning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> Their object in these naval expeditions is to create discontent in the <rs>South</rs>, and to force the withdrawal of our troops from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> With little anticipation of eliciting a newspaper controversy did I pen the article (<q>&#x0022;A Plea for Chaplains&#x0022;</q>) which recently appeared in your columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>But as <q>&#x0022;A Chaplain Without Pay&#x0022;</q> has given vent to his patriotism through the same channel, I must beg the privilege of a reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> That the <q>&#x0022;manifest design&#x0022;</q> of my article was to prevent the reduction of the <rs>Chaplain</rs>'s pay is evident; but that it was to increase their salaries, to make the <name>Chaplaincy</name> a moneyed office, to secure the services of <q>&#x0022;preachers in black,&#x0022;</q> which all <hi rend="italics">Chaplains without pay</hi> certainly are, or to <q>&#x0022;annoy Government&#x0022;</q> by provoking applications from ministers who preach for money and not for the salvation of souls, is too enormous to be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>By a law of the <orgName n="Southern Congress" type="congress">Southern Congress</orgName>, all Chaplains are commissioned officers, with the rank of <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">1st Lieutenant</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>A <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">1st Lieutenant</rs>'s pay is <measure n="90dollars" type="currency">ninety dollars</measure> per month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Why should the <rs>Chaplain</rs>'s be less? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> Further, the <name>Chaplaincy</name> is an office of fearful responsibility, and a position of influence, dignity, and weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>A Chaplain must not simply be a preacher; he must be a man of social qualities, a man of nerve, a man of industry, and, most of all, a man of talents; and, unless their salaries be such as to afford partial inducements for them to sacrifice their positions at home, they would be justified in absenting themselves from the ranks, and do, as doubtless many a <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> without pay</hi> has done, congregate in cities, live on the bounty of friends, sing patriotic psalms to their brethren in the field about <hi rend="italics">low</hi> salaries, and never once during the war endure the fatigue of a forced march, or the discomforts of a bivouac on picket for <num value="3">three</num> rainy days and nights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> The profession of the <rs>Chaplain</rs> is not to bear arms, and he cannot perform the duties of his office if he has to live as many of our noble, heroic soldiers are compelled to live.--He <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have more leisure, more comforts, and better living; and to defray his own expenses, to say nothing of his clothing, will cost more than half the salary allowed him. In the meantime what is to become of his deserted family?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>The minister who is worthy being a Chaplain, is apt to be, as is the case with the majority of able preachers, a man of family, a man of mind, and <hi rend="italics">a man of poverty.</hi> Patriotism would dictate to such a man to remain at home, sustain his family, Christianize his community, and endeavor by his prayerful eloquence to secure for his bleeding country the assistance of a merciful <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, rather than his little ones should suffer or be thrown upon the charities of his neighbors, while he was laboring almost free of charge in the tented field for a country abounding in wealth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> <q>&#x0022;A Chaplain Without Pay&#x0022;</q> will excuse me for agreeing with him, exactly, when he says, <q>&#x0022;in fact there is no necessity for any paid Chaplains for this city.&#x0022;</q> My <q>&#x0022;plea&#x0022;</q> was exclusively <unclear></unclear> perhaps should have been so stated, for whose men of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who, in addition to the usual concomitants of the pulpit, buckle on the armor of <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName>, and undergo the privations of the camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/> As to the <q>&#x0022;soldiers contributing something extra to the support&#x0022;</q> of the man they want, and who won't stay for <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> per month, this is all stuff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Many a poor soldier here, near <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, who, while at home in his little hut, surrounded by his industrious wife and barefoot little children, can luxuriate without cost upon rich milk and sweet butter, and all kinds of vegetables, can scarcely lay up, per month, enough to buy his wife a calico dress, if he ventures to gratify his palate with these luxuries once a week. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/> A word more, <persName n="Editor,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Editor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Editor</surname></persName>, if you please, and I address it particularly to <q>&#x0022;A Chaplain Without Pay.&#x0022;</q> Since the reduction by Congress of the <name>Chaplains</name>' pay, many of the regiments in the <q>&#x0022;<orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">Army Corps</orgName> of the <rs>Potomac</rs>&#x0022;</q> have lost their Chaplains by resignations.
