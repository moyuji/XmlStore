<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> To the <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName></orgName>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen:</hi> My Message addressed to you at the commencement of the session, contained such full information of the state of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as to render it unnecessary that I should now do more than call your attention to such important facts as have occurred during the recess, and to matters connected with the public defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> I have again to congratulate you on the accession of new members to our Confederation of free, equal and sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Our loved and honored brethren of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> have consummated the action, foreseen and provided for at your last session, and I have had the gratification of announcing, by proclamation, in conformity with law, that those States were admitted into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, also, by a majority previously unknown in her history, have ratified the action of her Convention, uniting her fortunes with ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The States of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have likewise adopted the permanent Constitution of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and no doubt is entertained of its adoption by <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> at the election to be held early next month. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> I deemed it advisable to direct the removal of the several Executive Departments, with their archives, to this city, to which you had removed the seat of Government, immediately after your adjournment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The aggression movements of the enemy required prompt and energetic action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The accumulation of his force on the <rs>Potomac</rs> sufficiently demonstrated that his efforts were to be directed against <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; and from no point could the necessary measures for her defence and protection be an efficiently directed as from her own capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The rapid progress of events for the last few weeks his fully sufficed to strip the veil behind which the true policy and purposes of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had been previously concealed; their odious features now stand fully revealed; the <name>Message</name> of their <rs type="role2">President</rs> and the action of their Congress during the present month, confess the intention of subjugating these States by a war, whose folly is equalled by its wicked <unclear></unclear> a war by which it is impossible to attain the proposed result, whilst its dire calamities not to be avoided by us, will fall with double ??verity on themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Commencing in <date value="03">March</date> last, with an affectation of ignoring the secession of the <num value="7">seven</num> States which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organized this Government, persisting in <date value="04">April</date> in the idle and absurd assumption of the existence of a riot which was to be dispersed by a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">posse comitatus,</hi></foreign> continuing in successive months the false representation that these States intended offensive war, in spire of the conclusive evidence to the contrary, furnished as well by official action, as by the very basis on which this Government is constituted, the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and his advisers succeeded in deceiving the people of those States into the belief that the purpose of this Government was not peace at home, but conquest abroad; not the defence of its own liberties, but the subversion of those of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The series of man&#x0152;avres by which this impression was created, the art with which they were devised, and the perfidy with which they were executed, were already known to you, but you could scarcely have supposed that they would be openly avowed, and their success made the subject of boast and self-laudation in an executive message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Fortunately for the truth of history, however, the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> details with minuteness the attempt to reinforce <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>, in violation of an armistices of which he confesses to have been informed, but <q>&#x0022;only by rumors too vague and uncertain to fix attention;&#x0022;</q> the hostile expedition dispatched to supply <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, admitted to have been undertaken with a knowledge that its success was impossible; the sending of notice to the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> of his intention to use force to accomplish his object, and then quoting from his Inaugural Address the assurance that there could be no conflict, unless these States were the aggressors, he proceeds to declare that his cousin, as just related by himself, was a performance of this promise, <q>&#x0022;so free from the power of ingenious sophistry as that the world should not be able to misunderstand <unclear></unclear> and in defiance of his own statement that regard notice of the approach of a hostile fleet, he charges these States with becoming the assailants of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, &#x0022;without a gun in sight or <hi rend="italics">in expectancy</hi> to return their fire, save only the few in the fort.&#x0022; </q> He is indeed fully justified in saying that the case <q>&#x0022;is so free from the power of ingenious sophistry that the world will not be able to misunderstand it.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Under cover of this unfounded pretence that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are the assailants, that high functionary, after expressing his concern that some foreign nations <q>&#x0022;had so shaped their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our <orgName n="National Union" type="newspaper">National Union</orgName> was probable, &#x0022;</q> abandons all further disguise, and proposes <q>&#x0022;to make this contest a short and decisive <num value="1">one</num>,&#x0022;</q> by placing at the control of the <rs>Government</rs>, for the work, <hi rend="italics">at least</hi> <unclear></unclear> men, and <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure>. The Congress, concurring in the doubt thus intimated as to the sufficiency of the force demanded, has increased it to half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men.--These enormous preparations in men and money, for the conduct of a war on a scale more gigantic than any which the new would has ever witnessed, is a distinct avowal, in the eyes of civilized man, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are engaged in a conflict with a great and powerful nation; they are at last compelled to abandon the presence of being engaged in dispersing rioters and suppressing insurrections, and are driven to the acknowledgment that the ancient Union has been dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They recognize the separate existence of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> by the interdiction, embargo, and blockade of all commerce between them and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, not only by sea, but by land; not only in ships, but in rail-cars; not only with those who bear arms, but with the entire population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Finally, they have repudiated the foolish concent that the inhabitants of this Confederacy are still citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; for they are waging an indiscriminate war upon them all, with a savage ferocity unknown to modern civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In this war rapine is the rule; private residences, in peaceful rural retreats, are bombarded and burnt; grain crops in the field are consumed by the torch; and when the torch is not convenient, careful labor is bestowed to render complete the destruction of every article of use or ornament remaining in private dwellings, after their inhabitants have fled from the outrages of a brutal soldiery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> <date value="1781">In 1781,</date> <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, when invading her revolted Colonies, took possession of the very district of country near <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> now occupied by troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.--The houses then inhabited by the people, after being respected and protected by avowed invaders, are now pillaged and destroyed by men who pretend that the victims are their fellow citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Mankind will shudder to hear the tales of outrages committed on defenceless females by soldiers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> now invading our homes, yet these outrages are prompted by inflamed passions and the madness of intoxication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But who shall depict the horror with which they will regard the cool and deliberate malignity which, under pretext of suppressing an insurrection, said by themselves to be upheld by a minority only of our people, makes special war on the sick, including the women and the children, by carefully devised measures to prevent their obtaining the medicines necessary for their cure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The sacred claims of humanity, respected even during the fury of actual battle, by careful diversion of attack from the hospitals containing wounded enemies, are outraged in cold blood, by a Government and people that pretend to desire a continuance of fraternal connexions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> All these outrages must remain unavenged, save by the universal reprobation of mankind, in all cases where the actual perpetrators of the wrongs escape capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They admit of no retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The humanity of our people would shrink instinctively from the bare idea of waging a like war upon the sick, the women and the children of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> But there are other savage practices which have been resorted to by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which do admit of repression by retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I have been driven to the necessity of enforcing this repression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The prisoners of war taken by the enemy on board the armed schooner <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, sailing under our commission, were, as I was credibly advised, treated like common felons; put in irons, confined in a jail usually appropriated to criminals of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dye, and threatened with punishment as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I had made an application for the exchange of these prisoners, to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the enemy's squadron off <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, but that officer had already sent the prisoners to New York when the application was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I therefore deemed it my duty to renew the proposal for the exchange to the constitutional <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in-Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the only officer having control of the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>To this end I dispatched an officer to him, under a flag of truce; and in making the proposal of informed <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> of my resolute purpose to check all barbarities on prisoners of war, by </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> such severity of retaliation on the prisoners held by us as should secure the abandonment of the practice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> This communication was received and read by the officer in command of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">Army of the United States</orgName>, and a message was brought from him by the bearer of my communication, that a reply would be returned by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I earnestly hope that this promised reply, which has not yet been received, will convey the assurance that prisoners of war will be treated in this unhappy contest with that regard to humanity which has made such conspicuous progress in the conduct of modern warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>As a measure of precaution, however, and until the promised reply is received, I still retain in close custody some officers captured from the enemy, whom it had been my pleasure previously to enlarge on parole, and whose fate must necessarily depend on that of the prisoners held by the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> I append a copy of my communication to the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and of the report of the officer charged to deliver it, marked <persName n="Doc,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Doc,nomatch:0"><surname>Doc</surname></persName>. A. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> There are some other passages in the remarkable paper to which I have directed your attention, having reference to the peculiar relations which exist between this Government and the <name>States</name> usually termed the border slave States, which cannot properly be withheld from notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The hearts of our people are animated by sentiments towards the inhabitants of those States, which found expression in your enactment refusing to consider them as enemies, or to authorize hostilities against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>That a very large portion of the people of those States regard us as brethren; that if unrestrained by the actual presence of large armies, the subversion of civil authority and the declaration of martial law, some of them at least would joyfully unite with us; that they are with almost entire unanimity opposed to the prosecution of the war waged against us, are facts of which daily recurring events fully warrant the assertion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> refuses to recognize in these, our late <rs type="role" reg="Sister">sister</rs> States, the right of refraining from attack on us; and justifies his refusal by the assertion that the <name>States</name> have no other power <q>&#x0022;than that reserved to them in the <rs>Union</rs> by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <hi rend="italics">no <num value="1">one</num> of them having ever been a State out of the <rs>Union</rs>.</hi> &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> This view of the constitutional relations between the <name>States</name> and the <rs>General Government</rs>, is a fitting introduction to another assertion of the <name>Message</name>, that the <rs>Executive</rs> possesses the power of suspending the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> and of delegating that power to military commanders, at his discretion; and both these propositions claim a respect equal to that which is fell for the additional statement of opinion in the same paper, that it is proper, in order to execute the laws, that <q>&#x0022;some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizens' liberty, that practically it relieves more of the guilty than the innocent, should, to a very limited extent, be violated.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> We may well rejoice that we have forever severed our connection with a Government that thus tramples on all the principles of constitutional liberty, and with a people in whose presence such avowals could be hazarded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The operations in the field will be greatly extended by reason of the policy which, heretofore secretly entertained, is now avowed and acted on by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The forces hitherto raised proved ample for the defence of the <num value="7">seven</num> States which originally organized the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, as is evinced by the fact, that with the exception of <num value="3">three</num> fortified islands, whose defence is efficiently aided by a preponderating naval force, the enemy has been driven completely out of those States; and now, at the expiration of <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> from the formation of the <rs>Government</rs>, not a single hostile foot presses their soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>These forces, however, must necessarily prove inadequate to repel the invasion by half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, now proposed by the enemy; and a corresponding increase in our forces will become necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The recommendations for the raising and efficient equipment of this additional force will be contained in the communication of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, to which I need scarcely invite your earnest attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> In my Message delivered in <date value="04">April</date> last, I referred to the promise of abundant crops with which we were cheered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The grain crops generally have since been harvested, and the yield has proven to be the most abundant known in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Many believe the supply adequate to <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> consumption of our population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Cotton, sugar and tobacco, forming the surplus production of our agriculture, and furnishing the basis of our commercial interchanges, present the most cheering promise; and a kind <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has smiled on the labor which extracts the teeming wealth of our soil in all portions of our Confederacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> It is the more gratifying to be able to give you this assurance, because of the need of a large and increased expenditure in the support of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Elevated and purified by the sacred cause they maintain, our fellow-citizens of every condition in life exhibit the most self-sacrificing devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They manifest a laudable pride of upholding their independence, unaided by any resources other than their own; and the immense wealth which a fertile soil and genial climate have accumulated in this Confederacy of agriculturists, could not be more strikingly displayed than in the large revenues which, with eager zeal, they have contributed at the call of their country.--In the single article of cotton, the subscriptions to the loan proposed by the <rs>Government</rs> cannot fall short of <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> of dollars, and will probably largely exceed that sum; and scarcely an article required for the consumption of the army is provided otherwise than by subscription to the produce loan so happily devised by your wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, in the report submitted to you by him, will give you the amplest details connected with that branch of the public service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> But 'tis not alone in their prompt pecuniary contributions that the noble race of freemen who inhabit these States evince how worthy they are of the liberties which they so well know how to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>In numbers far exceeding those authorized by your laws, they have pressed the tender of their services against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Their attitude of calm and sublime devotion to their country; the cool and confident courage with which they are already preparing to meet the threatened invasion in whatever proportions it may assume; the assurance that their sacrifices and their services will be renewed from year to year with unfaltering purpose, until they have made good to the uttermost their right to self-government; the generous and almost unquestioning confidence which they display in their Government during the pending struggle, all combine to present a spectacle such as the world has rarely, if ever, seen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> To speak of subjugating such a people, so united and determined, is to speak in a language incomprehensible to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>To resist attacks on their rights or their liberties is with them an instinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Whether this war shall last <num value="1">one</num>, or <num value="3">three</num>, or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, is a problem they leave to be solved by the enemy alone; it will last till the enemy shall have withdrawn from their borders &mdash; till their political rights, their altars and their homes are freed from invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Then, and then only, will they rest from this struggle, to enjoy in peace the blessings which, with the favor of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, they have secured by the aid of their own strong hearts and sturdy arms. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>That proclamation, however, seems to afford a sufficient justification for considering these published statements as not devoid of probability. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> It is the desire of this Government so to conduct the war now existing as to mitigate its horrors as far as may be possible; and, with this intent, its treatment of the prisoners captured by its forces has been marked by the greatest humanity and leniency consistent with public obligation: some have been permitted to return home on parole, others to remain at large under similar condition within this Confederacy, and all have been furnished with rations for their subsistence, such as are allowed to our own troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It is only since the news has been received of the treatment of the prisoners taken on the <rs>Savannah</rs>, that I have been compelled to withdraw these indulgencies, and to hold the prisoners taken by us in strict confinement. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> The hypocritical friends of <q>&#x0022;free speech and free discussion&#x0022;</q> have appropriately opened Congress by the passage of a gag law. They have passed a resolution to cut off, by the mere <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ipse dixit</hi></foreign> of the <rs>Speaker</rs>, every proposition of peace every effort at compromise, in fact every movement not intended to prosecute this bloody and inhuman war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The country which had fondly hoped that he might yet be influential in presenting some proposition to stop this accursed din of arms, is doomed to disappointment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Protests against such unheard of despotism, as crushing out the freedom of Congressmen, were of no use. <persName n="Wickliffe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Wickliffe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wickliffe</surname></persName> (Ky) declared in the name of his constituents, his country and <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that the legislation of this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> should be left free and untrammelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>But he was answered with a general sneer, and every proposition looking to freedom of discussion was instantly voted down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The cloven foot, cunningly concealed in the folds of the flag of the <rs>Union</rs>, is now exposed to view, and Black Republicanism stands forth revealed in its true light, the enemy of popular liberty, the hater of free inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>It not only fetters the people, but it shackles their representative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Little more can the noble and gallant defenders of the <rs>Union</rs> do in Congress now than look on in sorrow and shame, while the <name>Disunionists</name> complete the destruction of our county. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>All around them they see men wild with fanaticism, intoxicated with passion, rushing the ship of State over rocks and breakers into the maelstrom of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Will not the venerable <rs>Crittenden</rs> raise his voice in this, apparently the last agony of a nation's death?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Will he not expose, with his withering touch, the real designs of the wicked party in power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The gallant <rs>Vallandigham</rs> has rung the tocsin of alarm in the <name>Great West</name>, and the people are there arousing in their might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>But we need some man of <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>'s years and patriotic impulses to strike another chord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We trust he will not fail to do so. Let us have peace and we can have the union; but if we have war, we must have disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Let the party in power be rebuked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Let us stand for free speech, untrammeled discussion, and let the cry go forth <q>&#x0022;Down with gag laws! &#x0022;</q>--<q>&#x0022;Down with Black Republicanism!&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The period has been so recent since the adjournment of Congress, that little was to be brought before the attention of that body which had not been urged in the previous Message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Accordingly, the <rs>President</rs> has confined himself chiefly to a cutting rebuke of some of the positions taken by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> in that functionary's late Message to the <orgName n="Northern Congress" type="congress">Northern Congress</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> The Message is admirably written, and is most just and severe in its allusions to the course of conduct pursued by the <rs>North</rs> in the war they are waging on us. We are glad to see the position taken by the <rs>President</rs> in respect to the policy of retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> cure for the barbarities which the <rs>North</rs> are systematically practicing upon Southern citizens and property happening to fall into their power in this war; and the country will unanimously sustain the <rs>President</rs> in his determination to meet their outrages by measures as severe if they are less course and brutal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, is the true text for our policy towards such an enemy as we have to deal with in this contest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> There is a large class of barbarities which the <rs>South</rs> cannot expect to avenge in kind. --Their ruthless war upon women and non-combutants cannot be imitated even in retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Their infamous petty practices of pig stealing and hen-roost robbing cannot be arrested; for it is repulsive to the instincts of a Southern soldier to meet petty theft by petty injuries as low and vile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Other modes of severity, less outrageous and less vile, however, can be adopted, and we trust that stern and complete satisfaction will be exacted through the prisoners that fall into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The enemy has had his last <placeName reg="Rich Mountain, Randolph, West Virginia" key="tgn,2616904">Rich Mountain</placeName> success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>He will enjoy no more fortune of that sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>We shall capture from him many prisoners; and we shall, have it in our power to punish with inexorable rigor whatever enormities he may be guilty of in the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The occasion of the condemnation of our privateers in New York was admirably chosen for sending this admonition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>If the cowardly <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> shall dare to inflict judicial murder and ignominy upon those brave men, we shall meet the act by consigning an equal number of prisoners to the exact fate which may be visited upon those men. The conduct of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> in the matter of the distinguished spy <hi rend="smallcaps">Anree,</hi> did more to teach <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> a proper respect for the laws of war in the <name>Revolution</name> than all the leniency which he had magnanimously used towards them in the whole course of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> We should make our examples equally conspicuous and notable, and we should execute our measures of rigor with the same calm resolve and dignity as that which marked the conduct at <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> in that affair, in which we may suppose his manly heart was wrung, as violently as his determination to exact a needful measure of public justices was relentless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> In all ages and among the most enlightened casuists the <foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italics">lex talionois</hi></foreign> has been held a legitimate measure of warfare, and often a necessary instrumentality of public justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>If there ever was a war in which it was more than another justifiable in the circumstances provoking a resort to it, or more necessary as a means of self-protection against the most shocking and wanton barbarities, it is this war of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> upon the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> The moving of an invading army in a hostile country is a prodigious undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> requirements would be an immense number of horses, for the <num value="3">three</num> services, of cavalry artillery and transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The cavalry are the eyes and ears of an army, and an invading column would have to be strongly furnished with this arm of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/><num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> cavalry would be a small complement for an invading column <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The column would have to be very strong also in artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The complement of horses required for this service should be as great as that for the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The transportation, too, of baggage and provisions for such a force would be prodigious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>This service alone would require <num value="6000">six thousand</num> horses, and a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> as many baggage wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Thus, <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> horses would be a small estimate of the number of animals required for an invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> projected against <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>So long as his operations lie along the sea shore, the navigable water courses, and unobstructed railways, he can accomplish his objects with some degree of facility and success, but the moment he has to depend upon other means of transportation, his movements at once come to an end, and all his arrangements are discovered to be at fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The <rs>North</rs> is a country very unprolific of horses, and it is next to impossible to procure the requisite supplies for any purposes. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Not knowing the exact position the other regiments of our brigade occupied, and as the heat of the fire was chiefly conducted against and sustained by us, I will strictly confine myself to the part we bore in the fight, leaving it to the others to state their share in it. Our brigade left <placeName reg="Camp Pickens">Camp Pickens</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">17th</day></dateStruct>, at <time value="10am">10 A.

Luckily for us, at about <time value="11pm">11 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>In the joy of my heart, I ran about <num value="20">twenty</num> paces beyond my post (don't tell it to the officer of the guard, to impart the tidings to the next sentinel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>But don't let me keep the news longer from you. Suffice it to say, that we marched off at about <time value="8am">8 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>We marched towards the banks of the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> and threw ourselves behind the trees, in the bushes, flat on the ground, on our knees, standing, sitting &mdash; in short, every possible position or attitude which human nature possibly can assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>It was about half an hour before <num value="1">one</num> of our men spied the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and popped him down most unceremoniously, and shortly after that the ball opened for good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>True, <orgName type="company" n="Company I">Companies I</orgName> and <orgName type="company" n="Company D">D</orgName> had very little to do with it, as our post was not attacked during the day; and thus, besides sending now and then a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, who was inquisitive enough to pry in our affairs, feeling down the hill, (where they were posted,) we comparatively kept far from the enemy's fire, only a few musket balls, or a piece of shell, now and then lodging in and near the trees and bushes behind which we were deployed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/> The Lester Volunteers are now preparing to start for the seat of war, and I feel it to be my duty to ask your consent before I go. When I volunteered for on year, you seemed perfectly willing; but when I saw you last, you appeared dissatisfied that I had agreed to go during the war. It is needless for me to say anything in regard to the change which the <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName> has made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Let it suffice to say that I think it is nothing but right, and if I did not, I would be willing to go anyhow.--Nothing can be too hard, no sacrifice too great, when Liberty is at stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>But a father's love will foresee dangers, and urge a <hi rend="italics">cause.</hi> You point me to the toils, hardships and dangers of a soldier's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>These I know are great; but is the strong right arm of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> too weak to protect, too short to defend me from the vices and crimes which surround the soldier?--the only enemies I fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/><q>&#x0022;Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>but death is almost certain,&#x0022;</q> you respond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>I feel that death, in its most horrid and ghastly form, would have no terrors for me. <q>&#x0022;But perhaps you will not be needed; wait until you are called for again,&#x0022;</q> you reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>I have heard this advanced often, and have as repeatedly inquired, <hi rend="italics">when will that be?</hi> Will it be when our land is invaded and laid waste with fire and sword; our homes desolated; our loved ones butchered &mdash; when the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag trails in the dust, our army defeated and disorganized?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> But I feel that I cannot go without your consent, for you are my father, and as such you have the right to say whether or not I shall go. I beg you, as you love me, withhold not your consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>If you refuse, I must obey; but when it is done, life will have lost all charms for me, even if the <rs>South</rs> should, by a vigorous campaign, soon end the war by driving from our land the vandals of the <rs>North</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/> Oh! call me not back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Rather immure me in some loathsome dungeon; let me be the cringing vassal of some heartless tyrant; bind, rivet the clanking chains of an ignoble, perpetuated slavery upon me, rather than shower on my head the blessings of a liberty bought by the blood of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Let me pour out the gushing fountain of my own heart to secure my own rights, and I am content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>I want no liberty but my <hi rend="italics">own,</hi> achieved by my own exertions and purchased by my own blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> You want me to continue to my studies.--Do you suppose I can forget a bleeding country and devote my time and attention to the study of the law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Impossible! I sometimes take up my books, determined to forget everything else, but, soon my mind is wandering over the plains of the Old Dominion, and, in my imagination, I hear the thunder of cannon on our borders, and I see the smoke of battle ascend in dense columns towards Heaven, and books, home, self, are all forgotten, and I long for the hour of departure to arrive. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/> I know it will wring my heart to bid you perhaps a last farewell.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/> On the morning of the day just indicated, at between daybreak and sunrise, this command was attacked, and taken by surprise; no alarm or intimation of the enemy's approach having been given by the guard, or infantry pickets, until the enemy was within some <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> of the place, and had commenced the fire from his artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>By the examination, it is shown, that a main and <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName> as strong as was consistent with the effective infantry force present was regularly detailed and posted at distances sufficiently far out to accomplish the object in view provided they knew and did their duty; which latter is strongly to be suspected, from the fact, that although in advance, they failed to give any intimation of the enemy's approach; a conclusion which is strengthened by the official report of the mounted officers, out with the scouting parties on the night of the <date value="06-02">2d of June,</date> that they had neither seen an infantry picket, nor been challenged by its sentinels, going from, or returning to, the town that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>It appears, that immediately upon the arrival of the command at <placeName key="tgn,2119567" n="1.000 16" reg="philippi, barbour, west virginia">Philippi</placeName>, the officer in command, <persName n="Porterfield,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00468" reg="nearbymention:Porterfield,George,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Porterfield</surname></persName>, took measures to place his force, which was raw, and new in service, under a course of instruction, and to select shoes, in his opinion, best fitted to instruct the sentinels and guards in their duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>The testimony shows, that while there was a certain degree of confusion in some quarters, a portion of the command moved from the town in good order; and that the whole force, nearly, after passing some distance from the town, was re-formed and proceeded in order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/> It is shown in the evidence, that an expectation of attack, or movement upon <placeName key="tgn,2119567" n="1.000 16" reg="philippi, barbour, west virginia">Philippi</placeName> shortly to be made, was entertained generally among the officers and others of the command, and that intelligence (how well founded is not known) was brought, from time to time, of the strength and supposed intent of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/> The testimony sets forth, that this had so far produced its effect, as to induce the officer in command to call a meeting of his officers; that the result of their consultations and deliberations was an almost, if not unanimous decision in favor of immediate retreat; that when <persName n="Porterfield,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00469" reg="nearbymention:Porterfield,George,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Porterfield</surname></persName> returned to the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>(from which he had been absent a short time,) their opinion was conveyed to him, to which he seemed loth to accede; yet, determined to make a further examination of the ammunition on hand, and to prepare the baggage and train for removal at a moment's notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/> No orders to march, at any particular time, were given, so far as can be gathered from the testimony, although it appears that an understanding or impression was had or entertained by some, that the movement would not take place until morning, while some believed it contingent upon the weather. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/> These facts show, that the position at <placeName key="tgn,2119567" n="1.000 16" reg="philippi, barbour, west virginia">Philippi</placeName> was seriously threatened by a superior force of the enemy, distant only <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> march; that <persName n="Porterfield,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00471" reg="nearbymention:Porterfield,George,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Porterfield</surname></persName> was aware of the danger of his position, and prudently prepared to evacuate it. His desire to prevent the occupation of the town by the enemy was worthy of all praise; and had he prudently sent back his baggage and ineffective men, arranged his plan of defence, and taken proper measures to secure information of the advance of the enemy, he might safely have retained his position, and either given <unclear></unclear> or retired, as circumstances might dictate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>It does not appear from the record of the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, that any plan of defence was formed; but it does appear that the troops retired without his orders, and that the instructions to his advance guard were either misconceived or not executed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/> To these circumstances must be attributed the disaster that followed; and they call for heavy censure upon all concerned. </p>
