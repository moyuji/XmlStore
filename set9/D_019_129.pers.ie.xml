<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> We are at length able to say that we are ready for the vandals, though, for the last few weeks, we have been held very uneasy, for fear they would come down on us and find us unprepared to repulse a force of <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>; but now, let them come &mdash; we will be glad to manure our lands with their vile carcases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Being ready, I will tell you somethings about our readiness, but there are some things which we will not tell even to our friends; but should our enemies be disposed to find them out, why let them come, and they will be astounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><q>&#x0022;No inventive genius among the <name>Southerners</name>,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;no energy,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;no activity,&#x0022;</q> and many other such flattering epithets, we are used to. Circumstances develop men. Heretofore we have been content to hire, with our superfluous money, the ingenuity of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>; but now, how different. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> This unholy war, forced on us to enable them to continue to rob and cheat us, has brought out more talent than I ever dreamed could be found among us for contrivances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Only yesterday I witnessed the working of a heavy <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> gun mounted on a carriage constructed on a plan submitted by <persName n="Meeds,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Meeds,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Meeds</surname></persName>, carpenter of the <rs type="place">Yard</rs>, and built in <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>. <num value="2">Two</num> men can sweep this monster gun around the eastern horizon without the slightest jar or vibration, and those who work her are entirely covered from the shot of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In a week we will have several <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10-inch</measure> and a goodly number of solid shot guns mounted in the same way; and then let the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodles look out. I only wish they would make an attempt on our harbor with their ships for there are some of us who have sailed in those identical mammoth steam frigates, and know to an inch where to plant our shot; and we know, too, that there are other magazines to be blown up besides those that contain powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Our furnaces for hot shot, of which we are supposed to have known nothing, will each of them (and we have plenty) keep <num value="25">twenty-five</num> shot to a white heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In our sea-coast batteries we have a large number of guns mounted, and there is <num value="1">one</num> very tender point of the harbor where several large copper-colored oysters, holding in their shells <measure n="250pounds" type="mass">250 lbs.</measure> of gunpowder, have been planted, with good ranges, by which to explode them, with a nice little wire, led into <num value="1">one</num> of the batteries, and only requiring a small <q>&#x0022;contact&#x0022;</q> to hoist the batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>At this very tender point no less than <num value="6">six</num> batteries, with <num value="120">120</num> guns, will amuse them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Really, <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Dispatch,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Dispatch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dispatch</surname></persName>,</hi> I wish you could come down and see some of your mountain boys handle these heavy <num value="9">9</num>, <num value="10">10</num> and <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> guns, to say nothing of the <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> and <num value="42">42</num> and <num value="32">32</num>-pounders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> I have spent over <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> in drilling men, but I never yet have seen such apt scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The reason is that their hearts are in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>They want to learn, and thus encourage their instructors to bend every effort to teach them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I saw batteries drilled yesterday by men who never saw a heavy gun until a few weeks since, and they managed them as well as I have seen men do the same work after <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of daily drills. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> So much for the water; now for the land If ever we get the <name>Doodles</name> entangled in our swamps and marshes, we will give you a Flemish account of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They evidently want to land in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Burwell Bay, Isle of Wight, Virginia" key="tgn,1112746">Burwell's Bay</placeName>, and try to cut off our railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Well, may be they can do it, but <hi rend="italics">we</hi> don't think they can. All the country thereabouts is well cut up and marshy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The roads pass through heavy woods, and you know we are good hands at cutting down trees about them, and I rather guess they will find it hard to move their artillery over our big trees with several <num value="1000">thousands</num> of tip-top riflemen close at hand, who will shoot horses and officers in particular, and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Besides, we have batteries of <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">Light artillery</orgName> hereabouts, rifled guns, and <num value="24">24</num>-pound howitzers, which the vandals thought they spoiled by bending the screw, as we poor Southerners have no brains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Under <persName n="Pemberton,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>, of the late <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">U. S. army</orgName>, these batteries will soon be equal to any in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I know that Heaven is with our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>we see it in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ways; in the organization of our <orgName n="Flying Artillery" type="artillery">Flying Artillery</orgName>--<num value="1">one</num> great difficulty with us was to make the harness, no <num value="1">one</num> here having ever seen a set. <rs type="role">Col.</rs> P. had to attend to every detail, when <q>&#x0022;Heaven with us,&#x0022;</q> a gentleman here, had an entire set, bought at <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, after the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war, which not only equipped a battery, but taught our harness makers a thing or <num value="2">two</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> On the <rs>Norfolk</rs> side, we are more than anxious for them to try us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The loan is to be based on bonds and Treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> loan of <measure n="15000000dollars" type="currency">$15,000,000</measure>, the <rs>Congress</rs> levied a <num value="0.1">10 per cent.</num> export duty on cotton, and pledged the proceeds of that duty to the payment of the interest, and redemption of the principal of the loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The security is ample, for the natural export of cotton by the <rs>South</rs> is nearly <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> of dollars worth a year, <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> on which would pay off the loan in <num value="1">one</num> year, and <num value="5000000">five millions</num> to spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>But the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> have thought it prudent not to rely on that duty to give credit to the new loan that has been since authorized, of <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The fact is, that the <rs>Government</rs> has a plenty of credit at home; but her planters, with whom it enjoys credit, have their capital invested in lands and negroes, and not in cash funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The desideratum has been how to use this credit with her capitalists so as to procure money for her military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>It will not do to rely on paper money to carry on the war. Paper money is a spurious and dangerous system of finance, which, however it may answer for a time, is sure to explode, sooner or later, with terrible disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The object is to avoid too great an inflation of the paper circulation of the country by utilizing in some way the credit which the <rs>Government</rs> enjoys with the planters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> A very simple process has been adopted by which to effect this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>It is this, to call upon our planters and farmers to subscribe to the loan, and to pay their subscriptions, not in money, which they have not, but in crops, which they have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If a planter subscribes a <measure n="1000barrels" type="mass">thousand bales</measure> of cotton, the <rs>Government</rs> receives it, gives a receipt for the number of pounds and stipulates to deliver bonds for the amount for which the cotton is sold when the sale shall be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The tobacco planters may subscribe tobacco; the wheat and grain growers, wheat and grain; the rice growers, rice; the inland farmer, beef and bacon, in the same manner; though these latter articles, so far as required for provisioning the army, would be received at agreed prices and paid for in bonds or treasury notes at the time of the delivery of the produce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The possession of its value in money would give much power to the <rs>Government</rs>, but the possession of the cotton would give it more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Our company was placed, and remained in ambush not far from the scene of combat awaiting its issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>There were about <num value="200">200</num> fires of ball and shell from our batteries, and probably double that number from the enemy, none of which resulted in harm to us or our batteries, though they fell around and beyond us. <num value="11">Eleven</num> of our fires were thought to strike the enemy, <num value="2">two</num> of them passing through the sides of the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/> There arose from <num value="1">one</num> of the earlier fires from our battery a thick column of smoke which formed into a perfect and beautiful circle, which rose, slowly appearing like the halo of light with which the head of saints are represented as being surrounded &mdash; and hovered over us seemingly as an auguration of safety and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>May it not have been ominous of the interposition of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> in our behalf?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/> The <rs>Judge</rs> saw through the case at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>He charged the jury that if they thought there was anything wrong in the man scratching his foot during a game of poker, they would so find; but if they thought that such a movement was on the square, they would also be likely to pass over the act of fumbling with shirt sleeves, committed by the plaintiff. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/> The <q>&#x0022;charge&#x0022;</q> was followed by loud demonstrations of approval, such as yelling, throwing up hats, &#x0026;c. </p>
