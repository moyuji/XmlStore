<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The great advantage we possess over the enemy is in our ability to move our entire army to a given point within <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>. Thus we can concentrate rapidly and effectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Federals, on the contrary, are compelled to make long <hi rend="italics">detours,</hi> which occupy a day or more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They also encounter obstructions in the shapes of water-courses, that have to be forded or bridged, new roads have to be out, and <unclear> undry</unclear> other arrangements have to be made by which they can move readily and conveniently from point to point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They seemed heartily glad to have been captured, and thus saved the risk of losing their valuable entities upon a bloody battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Neither appeared to know anything concerning the designs or movements of the <rs>Federal</rs> army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Speaking of water, we too are suffering terribly from this cause, though, as far as possible, wells are believe dug to replace the dry springs and branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>You feel it scraps the throat as it goes down; and after it gets to the stomach it lays as heavy and indigestible as a bed of mortar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Vegetables also seem to be in abundance there.

Veterans say the work was the hottest of the kind they have known since the war begun.--The enemy's pickets were strongly supported by heavy bodies in the rear, and the officers could be distinctly heard cursing the men to urge them forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It was not until late in the day, however, that any progress was made by them, and then it was only from respect for their artillery, which opened on our lines heavily with shell and cannister, that we retired. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> Our men all behaved gallantly, fought coolly, fired only when they saw their mark distinctly, aimed with deliberation and rarely failed to bring down their game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Many were seen to fail, and the cries of the wounded were clearly audible, imploring help. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The close proximity of the pickets and skirmishers at this time may be illustrated by the following incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> After having said this much, I come to that which more particularly touches the state of your own district and community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>We stand here at a time when, but for <num value="1">one</num> unfortunate event, it is probable that you and your workmen would alike be enjoying a great prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>That <num value="1">one</num> unfortunate event you have described in this address, and in my opinion truly, as <q>&#x0022;a deplorable struggle in which the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the great <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic are now engaged&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="italics">It is a deplorable struggle</hi> We are not of those if such were, who envied the greatness of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>[Hear, hear] We could have been well content to see her enlarge her borders from year to year, gradually increasing in her wealth and strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We should have retained the consciousness that on our part nothing would be done to prevent the continuance of the most friendly and peaceful relations, [hear, hear,] and the admiration with which we regarded the energy of that nation would have been totally untinged either by envy or by fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>[Applause.] But this struggle has come about through no fault of ours, and I think we cannot but feel that the position and attitude of this country with respect to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have not been on the other side of the water quite impartially or fairly judged [Cheers.] I am not going to make this a matter of complaint. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> Let us sympathize with our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> brethren in their difficulties--[hear, hear] --let us allow that under the excitement of their difficulties, and of a desperate and agonizing conflict, the minds of men are not in that state of tranquility which renders them the best judges of the conduct of their neighbors.--[Hear, hear]. Under such circumstances the proportion of objects alters before the eye, and expectations are formed, and are thought to be just, which, in a dispassionate moment, will be seen and felt, to have been unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Why, there was a demand made upon us by the public voice in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> at the outset of this deplorable struggle for what was called, sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>What was the real meaning of this demand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>If I can understand it &mdash; and I hope in what I say I shall not say a word inconsistent with that fraternal policy which I desire to cherish toward all men, and specially toward our kindled beyond the water &mdash; but, practically, what was the meaning of that desire, and that call for sympathy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>It was this &mdash; that we should take such a course by our language, and by our public acts, as would place the <num value="6000000">six millions</num> of men, or <num value="10000000">ten millions</num>, I care not which you call them, of the <rs>South</rs> in a permanent hostility with us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> We may have our own opinion &mdash; and I imagine we have them &mdash; about the institution of the <rs>South</rs>--[cheers]--an, unfortunately, we <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> may have our private opinions about the countenance that has been given to those institutions in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>[Cheers.] But that is no reason, on the <num value="1">one</num> side or the other, why we should adopt a course of conduct that is <unclear></unclear> the foundations of alienation, of bad feeling, and permanent hostility between ourselves and those who may hereafter be a great nation, claiming to enter into peaceful relations with us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> No doubt, if we could say this was a contest of slavery and freedom, there is not a man within the length, and breadth of this room &mdash; there is, perhaps, hardly, a man in all <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> &mdash; who would for a moment hesitate upon the side he should take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>[Hear, hear.] But we have no faith in the propagation of free institutions at the point of the sword.-- [Cheers] It is not by such means the ends of freedom are to be gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Freedom must be freely accepted, freely embraced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>You cannot invade a nation in order to convert its institutions from bad ones int. good ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> And our friends in the <rs>North</rs> have, as we think, made a great mistake in supposing that they can bend all the horrors of this war to philanthropic ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>[Hear, hear.] Indeed, there are those among us who think &mdash; and I confess, for <num value="1">one</num>, I have shared the apprehension &mdash; that if in the course of the vicissitudes of the war the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> should send an embassy to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and should say: <q>&#x0022;Very well, we are willing to lay down our arms on <num value="1">one</num> condition; we are ready to renew the compact; we are ready to make it perpetual and attach to it every security and guaranty you can imagine for holding us fast; but upon <num value="1">one</num> condition &mdash; that you shall assure us that there shall be no interference with our domestic institution.&#x0022;</q> Ah, gentlemen, we have had a fear that application, if it were made, would receive a favorable reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>[Cheers] I think that it was well stated by my noble colleagues, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, that this was a struggle on <num value="1">one</num> side for supremacy and on the other for independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>[Hear, hear.] I cannot but sympathize with those who are making the struggle for supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>It is painful to surrender a great and imposing and magnificent national unity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> We, the <rs>English</rs> people, in other times have felt that pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>[Hear, hear.] We knew what it was Old George the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num> upon the throne &mdash; who had all the feelings of an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs>, whether you may approve his policy in all things or not, but he was a true <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> in heart and sentiment &mdash; old <persName><foreName>George</foreName> the <genName n="3">Third</genName></persName> felt his heart rent in twain by the laceration of the empire when the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Colonies were parted from us. But I think we feel this, that the experience we have had in our national history in some degree gives us means of judging of the prospects of this <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> struggle better than those which are possessed by the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> themselves [Hear, hear.] We have felt that after the pain of that severance was over we came at length to recognize it as a good, and we are thankful that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Colonies were parted from us, because we think we could not have governed them as much for their own advantages as they have been enabled to govern themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>[Applause] Some persons may say the <rs>Northern States</rs> are a great deal stronger than the <rs>South</rs>, and therefore they must win.--Well, gentlemen, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was a great deal stronger in olden times than <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>; but <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, as well as <persName n="Scotchmen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Scotchmen,nomatch:0"><surname>Scotchmen</surname></persName>, know that when it was the object of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> to establish a supremacy over <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, the <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> proved themselves to be what are called very ugly customers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>[Laughter and applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> At length, it was not the exercise of force, but a sense of policy and prudence on both sides, dictated in the main by natural circumstances, that led to the union of the <num value="2">two</num> kingdoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>But the position of the <rs>Northern States</rs> is this: <q>&#x0022;We won't let you go.&#x0022;</q> The position of the <rs>Southern</rs> is <q>&#x0022;We are determined to go.&#x0022;</q> Gentlemen, you are men of business; and if <num value="1">one</num> of you has a partner, and that partner wants to separate from you, I ask you whether, in the long run, if it is not difficult to hold him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>[Laughter.] But I ask you more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Supposing that you were able to hold that partner &mdash; supposing that you could contrive some indenture of partnership by which he should abdicate his free will, and tie himself to you like a captive to the <name>Charlot</name> wheels of a victor, but he still retaining an alienating heart, having no common interest in your business, but rather a desire to trip you up and embarrass you &mdash; I say, you would not hold that partner if you could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> The Northern States of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> have undertaken an enterprise of enormous difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>It is but fair, I think, that we should record our sense of the vast and gigantic energies which have been unfolded in the prosecution of that enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>They have had certain successes in the field; but again I fall back upon our <name>English</name> experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>If you revert to the annals of the war of independence between the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies and this country where were the successes in the field in that war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It was not for want of successes in the field that we did not conquer the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>It was this, that we found that when we had successes in the field we were no nearer our object than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>[Hear, hear.] It is not the question, when you are entirety bring to conquer a country, whether you can break up its embattles armies and drive them off the plain where they have contended with you in even fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The question is this, and this alone, whether the heart of the country is not upon separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>[Hear, hear.] If it is set upon separation, and if the blood of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the men of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> of his day still runs in the veins of those who inhabit Southern <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, then it is all out impossible that the military object should be effected; and if the military object were effected, the civil and political difficulties remaining would render that success itself a curse and a misery to those who had achieved it. [Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> We in this country are in the habit of plain speaking, and it is well, I think, upon this subject, considering the nearness and intimacy of our relations with all those who inhabit the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent, that we should test our minds in regard to the sentiments with which we view what you have well called this <q>&#x0022;deplorable struggle.&#x0022;</q> May the <rs>Almighty Disposer</rs> of events bring that struggle to an end. [Hear, hear.] For the sake of themselves, for the sake of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> above all, may that struggle quickly reach its termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>[Applause] <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> that take place, not which we wish to prefer, but which is for the peace, the happiness and welfare of the inhabitants of that country, be they white or be they black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>[Applause] We also feel the painful and deplorable effects of this struggle upon ourselves; it is impossible to deny them; and not upon ourselves alone, but of other countries of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> is suffering; <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> is suffering; every country that has a cotton manufacture is suffering grievously; more grievously, in proportion to the numbers employed, than in this country, because in these countries there is not the sense of independence &mdash; there is a greater disposition to lean upon the <rs>Government</rs> for help, than happily prevails among ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>[applause] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> But when we are told by any organ of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> opinion that <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, or that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, has behaved unhandsomely by <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, I feel the utmost confidence that the fine liverdict of history will be this &mdash; that there never was an occasion in which the civilized nations of the earth, in general, bore and had been content to bear, so much real misery, resulting from a municipal quarrel in another State without interference, as there has been on the present occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>[Applause.] If we look at the pain it has brought upon us, it is a grievous thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>In another point of view, it is a remarkable testimony to the real progress of civilizing and peaceful ideas among the nations of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>[Applause.] It is in homage to what is called an abstract principle that all this misery has been borne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>There has been a sense of danger and mischief of interference in intestine quarrels in other countries, and deference has been paid to that principle of international policy by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and by all the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>These, I say, are among the most remarkable features which determine the character of history as applicable to the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century in which we live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> In your own district it is impossible to move without being struck, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, by the menacing character of the time; no man knowing whether to-morrow will not be darker than to- day, and whether another month will not greatly advance the tale of suffering upon the month that is now passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>On the other hand, the moral signs find the social signs which the darkness of this period have brought into view, though the eye might not have discerned them amidst the glare of prosperity, are such as at once to touch the heart and cheer the minds of men with the hope that they contain for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>[Applause.] We are told that the people can not be trusted, that they are fit for nothing except to earn daily bread; that you must not call them to the exercise of higher functions or look to them for enlightened views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>I ask what practical evidence of enlightened views are the workmen of <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> and <persName n="Cheshire,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Cheshire,nomatch:0"><surname>Cheshire</surname></persName> now offering [applause and cheers] in their patient endurance, in their mutual help, and in their respect for order, in their sense of independence, in their desire to be a burden to no <num value="1">one</num>, [hear, hear,] in the patience with which they submit to positive privations [Applause.] and let me add, just thus much having been spoken of the people, that, if I am able to judge, the masters who employ them are worthy of those work people, and that I can give them no higher praise. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<head>The approaching battle.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The great battle which we have been so long anticipating, is evidently drawing very near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It may occur to-day, or to-morrow, but farther than a very few days we are assured that it cannot be postponed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>We have every confidence in the noble army which our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have drawn together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It is well disciplined, in high health, in fine spirits, and full of courage and enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It is, moreover, amply provided with the best arms, has a plenty of artillery, a superb body of cavalry and officers the best to be found in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It fights for the noblest of all causes &mdash; for liberty, for life, for homes, for firesides, for wives, children, fathers, mothers, brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>sisters, friends, everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>What more can be wanting to stimulate the exertions of men so brave, so patriotic, so unselfish, so forgetful of everything but their country, as those men have proved themselves to be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>We will not address them a word of exhortation for we feel that it is not necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They know their duty, and knowing it they will do it, to the very last <sic>tittle.</sic> The eyes of the whole world are upon them and from their deeds of to day, will decide whether they deserve in be free or to be the vassal of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> On the other hand, we are opposed to a host of disciplined ruffiane, who have been sent here to plunder and destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Their whole course of conduct since they have been here has proved that such was the object of their mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Their track is as though the angel of desolation had been along it. It is marked with ruin and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>They hesitate not to steal our property, to destroy all they cannot carry away to burn to rain in every possible way, and even to murder our unoffending citizens in their fields and their houses.--Crimes like these cry aloud to heaven for vengeance, and we feel assured that they will not go unpunished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>They seek to take this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>and to subject it to all the atrocities which they have insugurated into a system in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>They think if they can succeed in this, they will have &#x0022;extinguished the rebellion, as they are pleased to term our desire to separate from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, as if we owed any allegiance to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--as if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were once our masters &mdash; as if we had not a right to seek our own happiness in our own way, without asking the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> whether it was pleasing to them or not &mdash; This city once taken, or reduced to ashes they think they can easily reduce us to slavery &mdash; can easily lay the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> yoke upon our necks and rivet the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> chains upon our hands &mdash; can easily crush the spirit that has thus far upheld us, and last, we hope, will uphold us to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>In this they are mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The defeat of this army and the capture of this city would be a great plow, but it would not be final.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It would be far from being final.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>We have yet resourses for carrying on this war for <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> to come and in the event imagined, they would be employed to the uttermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>But our brave soldiers will not suffer either to happen.--They do not look like they mean to be happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>They do not talk like they were to be beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>They have tried the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and they know what they can do. They are confident that they can beat them, and they are burning with impatience to be led against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>For our own part we entertain not the least doubt upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Our only fear, hitherto, has been that our men would not be allowed to fight at all. That privilege once granted them, we have no further apprehensions whatever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> Our citizens must guard against <unclear></unclear> rumors and fears during the approaching fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>There will always be runaways from every battle, and they never fail to report that everything has gone to ruin, because they themselves have run away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Beware of such men. Do not listen to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>There must of course be a great deal of painful suspense and agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Let every good citizen refrain, as far as possible, from adding to it, and keep as quiet as he can. Doubtless, proper means will be taken of communicating from time to time such intelligences as the authorities have it in their power to communicate, and it will have the advantage of being certainly correct. </p> </div3>

<head>Never Despair.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> It is natural to the people of any particular locality that, when their own homes fall into possession of the enemy, they should begin to believe that their country is conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>There are, besides, despondent spirits everywhere, who, when the sun of good fortune sets, believe that it never will rise again, and commence filling the air with their owl-like lamentations. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> Perhaps there were some such in <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> a short time ago, but how short has been the period of their subjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>How grateful must be the reflections of its loyal people, who refused to take the oath of allegiance to despotism, and manifested, even in the presence of the enemy, a calm and dignified fidelity and firmness which their very adversaries must have secretly respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>What a contrast to the conduct of some localities, in which the oath of allegiance has been taken &mdash; with a mental reservation probably &mdash; by a few persons of whom we expected better things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If the people of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> had thus faltered in their manhood and honor, would they not have blushed to behold again the <rs>Confederate</rs> banner, and to look the honest hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> A town, a State, or a county may fall into the occupation of an enemy, and fall again and again, and yet the day of its ultimate and permanent deliverance be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Taking a city and keeping it are <num value="2">two</num> different things.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> To dream of subjugating the <rs>Southern States</rs> by capturing Southern cities, is a delusion which we cannot dispel from the <rs>Northern</rs> minds, but which should not be permitted to possess our own imaginations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Ditching and entrenching is a slow process for conquering such a large portion of this continent as the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>New Orleans has fallen, with <num value="200000">200,000</num> inhabitants, half a dozen other towns, with <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> more; if <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and every other town in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should fall, that would not involve in all a population of <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Not only the population, but the wealth and strength of the <rs>South</rs>, physical and intellectual, are in the country, which has always been its private mode of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>This vast country, which can supply its own wants of every kind by its own industry, can never be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Its little towns, the largest of which would hardly make a suburb of the great cities of the world, may be occupied for a time, but the country will remain its own master, and in the end secure their ultimate deliverance. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> Our enemies are beginning to discover that the old Union in the <rs>South</rs> is a ghost, of which a glimpse can scarcely be obtained even in dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Some of them are honest enough to admit that all reverence for the <rs>Union</rs> in the <rs>South</rs> has disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>How could it be otherwise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>When the cause of Liberty has received the baptism of blood, it is thenceforth a new creature; <q> &#x0022;old things have passed away &mdash; all things have become new.&#x0022;</q> We were struck with the remarks of an eloquent divine, that it is as true of such a cause as ours as it is of religion, that <q>&#x0022;without the shedding of blood there is no remission.&#x0022;</q> --Up to the hour when every family in the land was called upon to lay some firstling of the flock, or some pet lamb, upon the altar of this war, it might have been possible that the <rs>South</rs> would again have relapsed into its old associations, but after that solemn sacrifice, never.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The hands of these men are in the blood of our kindred and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They may conquer us; the yoke may be fastened upon our necks, but that is the only kind of Union that is henceforth possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Union with them, a voluntary Union, would be indeed a covenant with Death and a league with Hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>It would be a degradation by our own hands, such degradation as the world has never seen, and which, of all people in the world, the people of the <rs>South</rs> are the least likely to perpetuate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> We can hear their yoke &mdash; if it be necessary &mdash; and wait and hope through centuries for deliverance, we can bear, if they choose to inflict it, the loss of property and life, of friends and brethron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>We can wander impoverished among our own possessions, strangers in our own land; we can worship <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the rocks and woods; we can be thrust aside from every vocation of life by our invaders and conquerors; we can bear all these, and every other human ill; except a voluntary national companionship again with them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>That will never be. The stonement of blood has been consummated, and we are born again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>There is scarcely a family in our land which has not been clothed in mourning by these Restorationists of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Can they restore the dead that cover our plaine and hillsides?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Can their incantations to the <rs>Union</rs> stir those brave hearts that the grass is growing over?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Can their shout of Union bring back the union of the wife with her dead husband, of the mother with her noble son, or the sister with her cherished brother?
