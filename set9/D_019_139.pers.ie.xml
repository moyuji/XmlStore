<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> A series of unprovoked and unparalle led outrages have been inflicted upon the peace and dignity of this Commonwealth, and a pon the rights and liberties of its people, by wicked and unprincipled men professing to act under the authoritty of the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> To all these outrages and indignities you have submitted with a patrictic for bearance, which has only encouraged the perpetrators of these grievous wrongs to attempt still bolder and more daring usurpations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> It has been my earnest endeavor under all these embarrassing circumstances to maintain the peace of the <rs>State</rs>, and to avert, if possible, from our borders the desolating effects of a civil war. With that object in view, I authorized <persName n="Price,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName> several weeks ago to arrange with <persName n="Harney,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Harney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Harney</surname></persName>, commanding the <rs>Federal</rs> forces in this State, the terms of an agreement by which the peace of the <rs>State</rs> might be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>They came, on the <dateStruct value="-05-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, to an understanding, which was made public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The State authorities have faithfully labored to carry out the terms of that agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The Federal Government, on the other hand, not only manifested its strong disapprobation of it, by the instant dismissal of the distinguished officer, who, on its part, entered into it, but it at once began, and has unintermittingly carried out, a system of hostile operations, in after contempt of that agreement, and in recklees disregard of its own plighted faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>These acts have latterly portended revolution and civil war, so unmistakably, that I resolved to make <num value="1">one</num> further effort to avert these dangers from you. I therefore solicited an interview with Brigadler <persName n="Lyon,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,James,W.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName>, commanding the <rs>Federal</rs> army in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>It was granted, and on the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="10">10th inst.</day></dateStruct>, waiving all questions of personal and official dignity, I went to <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, accompanied by <persName n="Price,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> We had an interview on the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th inst.</day></dateStruct>, with <persName n="Lyon,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,James,W.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> and <persName n="Blair,Colonel,F.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="default:Blair,F.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Blair</surname>, <genName>Jr.</genName></persName>, at which I submitted to them this proposition: That I would disband the <orgName type="mil" key="StateGuard">State Guard</orgName>, and break up its organization; that I would disarm all the companies which had been armed by the <rs>State</rs>; that I would pledge myself not to attempt to organize the militia under the <rs>Military Bill</rs>; that no arms or munitions of war should be brought into the <rs>State</rs>; that I would protect all citizens equally in all their rights, regardless of their political opinions; that I would repress all insurrectionary movements within the <rs>State</rs>; that I would repel all attempts to invade it, from whatever quarter, and by whomsoever made; and that I would thus maintain a strict neutrality in the present unhappy contest, and preserve the peace of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>And I further proposed that I would, if necessary, invoke the assistance of the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> Nothing but the most earnest desire to avert the horrors of civil war from our beloved State, could have tempted me to propose these humiliating terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>They were rejected by the <name>Foderal</name> officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> They demanded not only the disorganization and disarming of the <rs>State</rs> militia, and the nullification of the <rs>Military Bill</rs>, but they refused to disarm their own <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">Home Guards</orgName>, and insisted that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> should enjoy an unrestricted right to move and <hi rend="italics">station</hi> its troops throughout the <rs>State</rs>, whenever and wherever that might, <hi rend="italics">in the opinion of its officers,</hi> be necessary, either for the protection of the <q>&#x0022;loyal subjects&#x0022;</q> of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, or for the repolling of invasion, and they plainly announced that it was the intention of the <name>Administration</name> to take military occupation, under these pretexts, of the whole State, and to reduce it, as avowed by <persName n="Lyon,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,James,W.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> himself, to the <q>&#x0022;exact condition of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The acceptance by me of these degrading terms would not only have sullied the honor of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, but would have aroused the indignation of every brave citizen, and precipitated the very conflict which it has been my aim to prevent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>We refused to accede to them, and the conference was broken up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> Fellow-citizens: All our efforts towards conciliation have failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>We can hope nothing from the justice or moderation of the agents of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in this State.--They are energetically hastening the execution of their bloody and revolutionary schemes for the inanguration of a civil war in your midst; for the military occupation of your State by armed bands of lawless invaders, for the overthrow of your State Government; and for the subversion of those liberties which that Government has always sought to protect; and they intend to exert their whole power to subjugate you, if possible, to the military despotism which has usurped the powers of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>As <rs type="role" reg="Agent">Agents</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, you have made this call upon the <name>Planters</name> of our State to sustain the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>, and to provide means for the defence of our soil, our liberty, our families and our religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>I have also read the <name>Act</name> of Congress authorizing the <rs>Treasurer</rs> to borrow this loan from the <name>Planters</name> of the country, that the <name>Covernment</name> may be provided with the means of defending everything we hold dear in the war which an abolition Government is waging against us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>They propose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to conquer and then to plunder us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The <rs>North</rs> will soon have <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> armed men in the field with the avowed purpose of subjugating the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>They have a vast amount of capital; they have a regular army and navy; they have a supply of the best arms; they have a large volunteer force composed chiefly of abolitionists, foreigners, paupers, laborers out of employment, adventurers, thieves, adulterers and murderers; they have blockaded several of our seaports; they are using every effort to destroy our commerce; they are plundering Southern men of their property, both upon land and sea; they have impressed slaves and compelled them to work upon their fortifications; they have taken cattle from planters and goods from merchants; they have hung and murdered our citizens; and at <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> some of these miscreants have insulted and abused Southern women. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> And now they threaten to take <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

They proclaim that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is to be whipped back into the <rs>Union</rs>, and that the other seceded States, after becoming impovers ished by blockade, are to be subjugated by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The gallant sons of the <rs>South</rs> are gathering to defend her liberty, her institutions, her honor, and her very existence as a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>But the sinews of war must be provided for this defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Our Government must have money to clothe, feed and arm her soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>A wise plan has been enacted to obtain it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> We call upon our fellow-citizens and friends to subscribe liberally of their next crop, to sustain the credit of our Government and afford the means for moving our army most promptly to victory. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Grape and canister fell like driving hall right into our faces, and men dropped right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>We gave them <num value="1">one</num> round in return and retreated <num value="15">fifteen</num> paces, and throwing ourselves flat on our faces, loaded and fired as fast as possible, until, finding there was no reserve, no main body, no nothing to fall back on, we got out from under this awful fire and got back to the <num value="2">two</num> field-pieces on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>The amount of revenue which each Government is likely to receive depends upon the amount of probable importations into their respective ports, and the amount of imports depends upon the amount of exports which each country is able to send out; for it is with these exports that the imports are purchased and paid for in foreign markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>We have, therefore, the fact that out of <measure n="316220610dollars" type="currency">$316,220,610</measure> of exporis of domestic industry, nearly <measure n="250000000dollars" type="currency">$250,000,000</measure> is furnished by those States known as slave States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/> Bearing in mind the fact &mdash; which cannot be questioned &mdash; that the imports of a country must be proportionate to its exports, and that upon the amount of imports depends the amount of revenue to be received, we have before us the most gratifying evidence of the great advantage, in this respect, of the <rs>Confederate</rs> over the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>In this table, we have included all the slave States--though <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> are not yet with us, and the general result would not be very materially varied if they never should come, as neither of them produce any considerable quantity of the great staple which gives such advantage to the <rs>South</rs> over the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/> The exports of a country are its surplue products, over and above its own consumption, and which find a market in the other countries of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>They constitute the highest evidence of the productive powers of a country &mdash; its wealth and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>It is the basis of commercial greatness, and the most certain source of revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The foregoing table and figures show that the slave States produce of these exports about <measure n="250990600dollars" type="currency">$250,990,600</measure>, whilst the <rs>Northern States</rs> produce less than <measure n="70000000dollars" type="currency">$70,000,000</measure>. If each section should import the amount of its exports, we could, by a duty of <num value="0.2">20 percent</num>, raise <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> of revenue, whilst it would require on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, a duty of over <hi rend="italics"><num value="70">seventy</num></hi> per cent, to raise the same amount of revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>With these facts and figures before us, and taken too, from the official records of our <unclear></unclear> enemy, we can afford to read with complacency their idle and extrayagant talk of superior advantages in financial resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>Nor </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>What hascaused it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Not a want of money, for there is an abundance there, anxionsly seeking a safe investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>The difficulty is the want of confidence in the security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>The monied men of the <rs>North</rs> prefer to hold their money and do nothing with it, than to trust a Government whose sinking fortunes point to certain and inovitable bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>On the other hand, look to the operations now going on in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Whilst our people have no large amount of surplus capital to invest in the bonds of our Government, they manifest their confidence in the security by promptly offering to agil their cotton and other products, and receive payment in the bonds and Treasury notes of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

If so, the annual expense of their Government cannot be less than <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars, and their receipts do not exceed <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>At this rate, they are increasing their public debt at least <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>How long will their people consent to a continu-ance of a war which is thus exbausting their resources, destroying their business and covering their Government with debt and bankruptcy, and which has for its object no higher motive than the gratification of the most malignant passions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>As long as they hoped to conquer us into subjection to their will, and thus force us to return to the <rs>Union</rs>, that they might continue to feed and fatten upon our substance, there was a practical object in the war, but that delusion is fast passing away, and when finally dispelled by the array of our army and the exhibition of our financial resources, we may look to an early peace, our prosperity and their ruin--<num value="3">three</num> very certain and well-deserved results.-- <hi rend="italics">Atheas Banner.</hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
