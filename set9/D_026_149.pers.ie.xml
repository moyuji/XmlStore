<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Up to the time the train left <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday afternoon nothing of especial interest had occurred on the lines during the day. There was an occasional discharge of artillery, and probably some exchange of shots between the sharpshooters, but nothing approximating a general engagement, or even an assault at any point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Fewer shells than usual fell within the city limits yesterday, and but little damage was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Hence it is inferred that a demonstration against the <rs>Danville</rs> and a southside Railroads is in contemplation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> After the above was written a telegraphic dispatch was received, which will be found in another column, announcing that an engagements took place in the evening, in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were whipped, losing a large number of prisoners, with cannon and color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It appears that the original purpose of the discomfited raider was to keep on down the north bank of the <placeName key="tgn,1126952" n="1.000 10" reg="Mattaponi, Virginia, United States">Mattaponi</placeName> to <placeName reg="Gloucester Point, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111953">Gloucester Point</placeName>, and there cross the river to <placeName reg="York town">York town</placeName> but this programme was changed, it is supposed, by an order from <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, directed him to retrace his steps to the <rs>James</rs>, Consequently, he crossed the <rs>Mattaponi</rs> at <unclear></unclear>Ferry, and is believed to have reached the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> during the night of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Our <unclear></unclear>reports that so far from going to <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, the enemy took a route leading towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This might have been done by striking a road which runs south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>At all events, it appears to be generally conceded that <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,Gen,,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> and his gang have made good their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>While this is a matter of regret; it is satisfactory to know that the purposes of the expedition have been signally defeated, with a loss to the enemy of fully <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> men. <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> kept up the pursuit with as much vigor as the <unclear></unclear> condition of his men and horses would allow, while <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,Gen,,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> had the advantage of <unclear> </unclear>horses, stolen from the farmers along the line of his retreat. </p>
