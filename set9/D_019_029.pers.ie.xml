<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>By the earliest conveyance, I reached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on the evening of the succeeding day, (<dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>,) and having had an interview with your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> and my Co-Commissioners, proceeded by the morning train of cars the next day (<dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <num value="23" type="ordinal">23rd</num>) for the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, which I reached on the afternoon of the same day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> I am thus particular in giving precise dates so that the <name>Legislature</name> may perceive that with all possible promptitude and dispatch I obeyed their wishes, and also to show that I was duly sensible of the importance of time in the whole proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Immediately after reaching <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, I addressed a note (marked <num value="1">No. 1</num>) to the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, informing him of my arrival, and asking an early hour to be designated by him to enable me to place him in possession of the wishes and feelings of the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName>, and the instructions which, in the form of her legislative resolves, all having direct reference to the disturbed and painful condition of public affairs, I was desirous of laying before him. He responded promptly, by note, and left it optional with myself to select <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> of that evening, or an early hour the next morning, for the time of the proposed conlerence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>My note <num value="2">No. 2</num>, for reasons therein set forth, informed him that I would wait upon him in the morning of the ensaing day. My note announcing my arrival, if the objects which had brought me to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had any consideration in the mind of the <rs>President</rs>, would, I did not doubt, suspend any hostile movement against any seceding State in the interval of time between its date and the hour at which I should wait upon him the next morning, and supercede the necessity of a night visit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> On the next morning, at the hour of <num value="10">ten</num>, I repaired to the <rs>President</rs>'s mansion, and met from him a warm and cordial reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I lost no time in handing to him your letter of appointment attached by the seal of the <rs>State</rs>, and legislative resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He said they were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> full copies of the resolutions which he had seen, and after reading them, he remarked that he considered them very important, and was good enough to add that, being borne by himself, he should feel it his duty to make them the subject of a special message to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Either I suggested, or he voluntarily remarked &mdash; most probably the latter &mdash; that he should accompany them with a strong recommendation to Congress, with whom, he said, rested the entire power over the subject of war or peace, to abstain from all action of a hostile character until <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should have a fair opportunity to exert all her efforts to preserve the public peace and restore harmony to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I said to him that my mission was to him &mdash; that he was <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy &mdash; could regulate the movements of soldiers and ships, in peace and in war, and that everything <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> desired was that the <hi rend="italics">status quo</hi> should be observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I represented to him that the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> were almost universally inclined to peace and reconciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>That I need not inform him of the sacrifice the <rs>State</rs> had made for the <rs>Union</rs> in its initiation, or of her instrumentality in the creation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>That her efforts to reconstruct or preserve depended for their success on her being permitted to conduct them undisturbed by outside collision. --He replied that he had in no messure changed his views as presented in his annual message-- that he could give no pledges &mdash; that it was his duty to enforce the laws, and the whole power rested in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He complained that the <rs>South</rs> had not treated him properly &mdash; that they had made unnecessary demonstrations, by seizing unprotected arsenals and forts, and thus perpetrating useless acts of bravado, which had quite as well been let alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I suggested to him that while these things were, I admitted, calculated to fret and irritate the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, that he could see in them only the necessary results of popular excitement which, after all, worked no mischief in the end if harmony between the <name>States</name> was once more restored; that the <name>States</name> wherein the seisures had been made would account for all the public property, and that in the meantime the agency or the preservation was only changed. --He repeated his sense of the obligations which rested upon him --could give no pledges but those contained in his public acts, and recurred again to <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> the proceedings of the <name>Legislature</name>, and his intention to send them to Congress in a special message, accompanied with a strong recommendation to avoid the passage of any legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I asked if I might be permitted to see the sketch of the message, which he unhesitatingly replied that he would take pleasure in showing it to me the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Much more occurred in the course of our interview, which lasted for an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, all, however, relating xclusively to the above topics, and I left him entirely satisfied with the results of my interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> was frank and entirely confinding in his language and whole manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A moment's reflection satisfied me that if the message, contained the recommendation to Congress to abstain from hostile legislation, I was at liberty to infer a similar determination on his part of a state of quietude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, <num value="25">25</num>.--I waited on him again the following morning, and he lost no time in reading me so much of the sketch of the proposed message as related to the recommendation to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I suggested no change or alteration, believing it to be amply sufficient, and I became only auxious for its presentation to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>He said he should have it all prepared to be ubmitted to his Cabinet on that day, and would send it in the next day. On the afternoon of the same day--<dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, <num value="25">25</num>--I was waited upon by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs>, who stated that they had called upon me at the request of the <rs>President</rs>, to express his regret that, in consequence of the adjournment over to <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, he would not be able to send in the message until <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>While in conversation with those gentlemen, which chiefly turned on the condition of public affairs, I was started by the receipt of a telegraphic dispatch from <persName n="Robertson,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,John,,,:2"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, my co-commissioner, dated at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, S. C.</placeName>, inquiring into the foundation of a rumor which had reached that place, that the <term type="ship">steamship</term> <rs type="ship">Brooklyn</rs>, with troops, had sailed for the <rs>South</rs>, from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.-- I immediately handed over the dispatch to the gentlemen, with the suitable inquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs> said in substance, <q> &#x0022;You know, sir, that I am attached to the <orgName n="Law Department" type="department">Law Department</orgName>, and not in the way of knowing anything about it.&#x0022;</q> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> said that he had heard and believed that the <rs>Brooklyn</rs> had sailed with some troops, but he did not know either when she started or to what point she was destined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I then said, <q>&#x0022;I hope that she has not received her orders since my arrival in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> On this point the gentlemen could give me no information, but expressed no doubt but that the <rs>President</rs> would give me the information, if requested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>I excused myself to them, and immediately withdrawing to the adjoining room, I addressed to the <rs>President</rs> note <num value="3">No. 3</num>, which <persName n="Staunton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Staunton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Staunton</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs>, kindly volunteered to bear in person and without loss of time to the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>In a short time afterwards <persName n="Staunton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Staunton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Staunton</surname></persName> returned to inform me that he had carried the note to the <rs type="place">President's house</rs>, but for a reason not necessary here to state, he could not see the <rs>President</rs>, but had placed it in the hands of his servant, to be delivered at the earliest opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The reply of the <rs n="President 2">President--No. 2</rs>--reached me at half-after <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>In the interim, I had dispatched by telegraph to <persName n="Robertson,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,John,,,:2"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> the information I had collected; and, upon the opening of the telegraphic office the next morning, (<dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>,) the material points of the <rs>President</rs>'s reply, relating to the sailing of the <rs>Brooklyn</rs>, viz: that she had gone on an errand <q>&#x0022;of mercy and relief,&#x0022;</q> and that <q>&#x0022;she was not destined to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>&#x0022;</q>--the orders for the sailing of the ship, as will be seen, were issued before I reached <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>After receiving the letter, and willingly adopting the most favorable construction of its expressions, I resolved to remain in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> until after <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, when the <name>Message</name> would go to the two Houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>I listened to its reading in the <name>Senate</name> with pleasure and can only refer to the newspapers for its contents, as no copies were printed and obtained by me before I left <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="29">29th inst.</day></dateStruct> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, I bade my adieus to the <rs>President</rs>, in the accompanying letter, marked <num value="4">No. 4</num>, to which I received his reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> The morning newspapers contained the rumor that the proceeding had been adopted of mounting guns on the land side of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and in my letter I deemed it no way inappropriate to call the attention of the <rs>President</rs> to those rumors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> Thus has terminated my mission to the <rs>President</rs> under the legislative resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>I trust that the result of the <rs>Brooklyn</rs>'s cruise may terminate peaceably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>No intimation was given me of her having sailed in either of my interviews with the <rs>President</rs>, and all connected with her destination remains to me a State secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I had no right to require to be admitted into the inner vestibule of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, however much I might complain should the results prove the errand of the ship from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to have been beligerent and warlike. </p> <closer> <salute>I am, dear sir.,</salute> <lb/> <salute>Respectfully and truly yours,</salute> <signed><persName n="Tyler,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="default:Tyler,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName>  <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,Robert,P.,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>. </closer> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/> Your note submits to me the important inquiry, whether the relation which the naturalized citizen holds to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, by reason of his oath at the time of naturalization, is different from that which exists in the case of any native-born citizen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>And whether the <num value="1">one</num>, any more than the other, owes allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--which would make his assent to an act of secession by a State improper or treasonable and against his oath and obligation of allegiance? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/> I feel no hesitation, in reply to your question, in stating, that all citizens, native and naturalized, stand upon the same basis in their obligations to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, and are, in all respects, equal; and that there is no such thing known in this country as an oath of allegiance to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, or to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by a foreigner, in order to his becoming a citizen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/> The oath, which the law requires of the applicant for naturalization, is <q>&#x0022;that he will <hi rend="italics">support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>;</hi> and that he doth absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to every <hi rend="italics">foreign</hi> <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>, Potentate, State or Sovereignty whatever, and particularly, by name, <rs type="role" reg="Prince">the Prince</rs>, Potentate, State or Sovereignty, whereof he was before a citizen or subject.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> He abjures all allegiance to foreign powers: but he swears no allegiance to the <hi rend="italics">Government</hi> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/> It is true he swears to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>So does every officer of Government, Federal and State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> ever swears <hi rend="italics">allegiance</hi> to any <hi rend="italics">Government.</hi> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> requires her officers to swear <hi rend="italics">to be faithful and true to the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>,</hi> but not to hold allegiance to its Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/> The reason of this distinction is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>It is a cardinal doctrine of our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> system that all governments are <q>&#x0022;instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people,&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;when a government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.&#x0022;</q>--[<rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">Bill of Rights</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> article. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, when she ratified the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, declared further, <q> &#x0022;that the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive to the good and happiness of mankind.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/> Every citizen of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, under these solemn declarations, made when she was establishing her liberty and independence, and when she was ratifying the <rs>Constitution</rs>, must feel that he owes no <hi rend="italics">allegiance</hi> to any man, or set of men, who may hold power in the <rs>Government</rs>; and that they may be changed, and the <name>Governments</name> themselves be abolished, if inconsisted with the well-being of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/> In the oath to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which the naturalized citizen has taken, he is not only not bound to allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but he is bound to support the <rs>Constitution</rs> against its violation by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The Government, in violating the <rs>Constitution</rs>, commits treason against the <name>States</name>, which formed it. It cannot be treason, then, in the citizen to overthrow these who traitorously violate a Constitution which he is sworn to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>On the contrary, it is his duty, and if his oath has any force in the matter, his <hi rend="italics">sworn</hi> duty, to aid his State in arresting the violation, and in maintaining the <rs>Constitution</rs> against the usurping Government, which tramples upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/> But it is urged, I am informed, that the naturalized citizen is a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and not of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>This is a great error. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/> Every man in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, only because he is a citizen of this <orgName n="State Congress" type="congress">State.--Congress</orgName> has power to naturalize for each State--a power which each State exercised prior to the <orgName n="Constitution Congress" type="congress">Constitution. Congress</orgName> now, as each State had done previously, naturalized foreigners for each State; and the result is the same in each case: the foreigner becomes a citizen of the <rs>State</rs> where he resides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The law of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> makes every naturalized citizen resident in the <rs>State</rs> a citizen of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/> The Constitution provides, that <q>&#x0022;the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.&#x0022;</q>--Thus, the citizen of each State becomes the citizen of every State, in regard to privilege and immunity &mdash; and may well be called a citizen of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, because he is a native or a naturalized citizen of <num value="1">one</num> of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> Nor have I any doubt that every citizen supports the <rs>Constitution</rs> when he finds it necessary to favor a withdrawal of his State from a Union which has violated the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> Each State is bound to the other States by the bargain of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Each has the right to judge finally when the bargain has been broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>No State is bound by a bargain broken by the other parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>To defend the <rs>Union</rs>, in such violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is to oppose, not to support it. To withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> to protect the rights which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has reserved under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and which are violated by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, is the only way to support it left to the people of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, when she adopted the <rs>Constitution</rs>, declared as a part of her act of ratification, that whenever the powers granted by her to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> should be <hi rend="italics">perverted to the injury and oppression of her people,</hi> those powers might be <hi rend="italics">reserved</hi> or <hi rend="italics">withdrawn</hi> by her. That was the condition of her accepting the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The other parties knew it; and that condition is, as to her, a part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Her right to withdraw, when her people are oppressed, is a part of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> for her citizens; nor can they doubt they support it when they shall support her in the exercise of a right which it reserved and secured to her. Nor can it be treason in them to obey her, who created the <rs>Government</rs>, rather than the <rs>Government</rs>, which is only her creature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>And it would be treason to her to refuse to obey her sovereign voice, should it be declared, for protecting her reserved rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, by secession from a Union which violated them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of a community of States, as each citizen is <num value="1">one</num> of the community of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>No <num value="1">one</num> denies the right of a citizen to withdraw from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in case she should oppress him. Every naturalized citizen has broken the bond of his former allegiance to secure his rights, violated or impaired in his native country, and his right to do so is recognized and protected by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The right of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to secede from the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName> is as clear as, I think clearer than, the right of a citizen to withdraw from his native land.

<head>How the iron plates for the great war<lb/>steamer were constructed.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/> The <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> <q>&#x0022;Engineer&#x0022;</q> gives the following interesting account of the process by which the iron plates for the new <name>English</name> <term type="ship">war steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Warrior</rs> are constructed: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/> The tests which were applied to the plates furnished by the builders of the <rs>Warrior</rs> were of the most trying character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Some plates were fired at with <num value="68">68</num>-pounders, at <measure n="200yards" type="distance">200 yards</measure> range, and were literally cut in halves by balls, fired <num value="1">one</num> after another, on a line drawn on the surface, each ball striking immediately below its predecessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>Upon some other plates the balls made a circular indentation upon the surface nearly as deep as the plates, exactly of the form of the projectile, and as though a mould had been taken of it in some soft and yielding substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>It was only after repeated trials that it was decided that the plates should be of annealed <rs n="scrap iron" type="product">scrap iron</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>The labor involved in building up these plates is enormous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, small scraps of iron are thrown into the fires, and, when in a state of red heat, are subjected to severe hammering, under the steam hammer, until the whole is beaten and amalgamated into a solid mass of about half a ton weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>This lump is then placed on the top of a similar mass, the whole made red hot, and hammered and welded together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Repeated additions of this kind are made until about <num value="5">five</num> tons of metal are thus welded together in <num value="1">one</num> huge, shapeless body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>This is then brought to a glowing white heat and placed under the huge hammer, the thundering blows of which gradually reduce it into shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>Again and again the enormous slab is put into the furnace and hammered into <num value="1">one</num> piece, <measure n="15feet" type="distance">15 feet</measure> long, <measure n="3feet" type="distance">3 feet</measure> wide, and <measure n="4.5inches" type="distance">4&#x00BD; inches</measure> thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>From <num value="10">ten</num> to a dozen men are engaged in the work of moving these ponderous masses of iron, which are moved about apparently with the most perfect ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Powerful cranes swing the molten mass from the furnaces to the hammer; a nicely-adjusted balance is provided by a massive iron lever, <num value="1">one</num> of which is welded into and forms part of the metal, and this is provided with a dozen or more of horns or handles, by which the iron can be turned in any direction; for the plates are not only hammered on the broad surface, but at the sides and at the top and bottom.--The plates, after having been roughly formed into shape, are completely planed and squared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/><rs n="planing machine" type="product">Planing machines</rs> of enormous size hug these plates in their resistless arms and bear them slowly and silently under the sharp cutting edges of the tools, and thin shavings of the metal, which, as they are cut off, coil up in long, bright ringlets of iron, attest the tremendous power of hese noiseless and all but omnipotent machines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>When the edges and surfaces are made perfectly smooth, like the finest work of the cabinet maker, the plates are placed on an end, gripped firmly by a mortising machine, and as they travel slowly backward and forward in the framework against a small tongue of steel, a groove of about <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> in width and depth is formed, into which the corresponding projections formed on the side of another plate will fit with the most perfect accuracy, the plates all being made to dovetail on each of the <num value="4">four</num> sides. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
