<head>Exchange of prisoners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> As the exchange of prisoners is to be resumed at an early day, this seems a proper occasion to comment upon the cruel policy which arrested it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> The attempt of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to place the slaves stolen by his marauders and recruited to fill up his ranks, on the same footing with white soldiers, and his refusal to continue the exchange of prisoners unless these slaves be exchanged for our own soldiers, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most impudent proceedings of which there is any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It is an attempt to force a surrender, on our part, of the whole ground, not openly made, but insidiously suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>These States seceded from the <rs>Union</rs> because they had every reason to believe that the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> secured the triumph of a party whose main &mdash; indeed, whose only &mdash; principle of action was open and undisguised hostility to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The war commenced upon that ground, and has been carried on upon it.--In the midst of this war <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> issues a proclamation, wherein, in open violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> under which he has become <rs type="role2">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, he proclaims all our slaves free, and calls upon them to rally to his support, in his endeavor to subjugate their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Now, he places the soldiers formed out of the slave population by this unwarranted proclamation, and this alone, in the same category with his white soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>If we consent to the exchange, we admit his right to liberate our negroes by his proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We admit that this proclamation has an effect which no act of Congress could have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>We admit that it has destroyed an institution guaranteed in integrity, by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>We admit that we still live under the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and that we are rebels, fighting against lawfully constituted authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>On the surface, this refusal to exchange except on the condition in question, seems nothing more than a dispute about the terms of such exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>In reality, if we resign our position, we give up all we have been fighting for. This cunningly devised scheme is above the reach of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>He is certainly well versed in the small quibbles of the lower class of attorneys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>But his intellect could never have grasped the far-reaching consequences which must follow the success of his negotiators in carrying the proposed plan of exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is at the bottom of this thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>It is characteristic of the man. It is full of cunning, but of cunning so transparent that the opposite party cannot possibly be deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of those devices which cunning men are apt to mistake for wisdom, but which is, after all, nothing more than cunning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> The effect, and the only effect, which this policy can possibly have, has been often pointed out, and, indeed, cannot be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It subjects a certain number of brave men on both sides to a long and painful captivity &mdash; a captivity commensurate indeed with the duration of the war. But it accomplishes no other object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>To suppose that it will induce the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, who have staked their all upon the issue of the struggle, to abandon the very ground upon which they entered into it, is to embrace a fallacy, which cunning may very well encourage, but which wisdom could never for a moment entertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>To believe that men who have shed so much blood, and endured so many hardships as the soldiers of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, will abandon the cause in which they have fought so bravely, and endured so patiently, merely to relieve a portion of their comrades from captivity, painful as it may be to them, and deeply as their feelings may be wounded by it, is to manifest an entire ignorance of the springs of human passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The greater part of these men have seen their homes desecrated or destroyed; their means of subsistence cut up by the roots; their lands wasted; their houses burned; their whole country turned into a wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In many instances they have seen their friends slaughtered before their eyes, and their wives and children turned out of doors, to subsist by charity, or by the exercise of their own industry under the most unfavorable circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>In a vast number of instances they are ruined men.--Yet, accumulated disasters, and the near prospect of still further disasters, have had no effect upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Or rather, if it has had any effect, it has been entirely the reverse of what might have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It has stimulated, instead of enervating them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It has made heroes out of men who, under other circumstances, might have been mere soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> With the most sincere pleasure, then, do we receive the report that the enemy has consented to put an end to the cruel and most useless policy, which he himself inaugurated, and for which he alone is responsible to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and to the opinion of mankind. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Nothing was too small to escape his eagle eye. Upon a march be was always to be found with his wagon train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when <num value="1">one</num> of his wagons was stuck in the mud, and the wagoners were standing around and cursing the mules, without doing anything to remedy the difficulty, he suddenly rode up, slighted from his old sorrel, took a rail from the fence, and went to work himself &mdash; an example which instantly recalled the men to a sense of their duty, and the wagon was soon put on <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">terra firma.</hi> </foreign> He then superintended the filling up of the hole in which it had sunk, so as to secure the uninterrupted transit of the rest of the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>This was <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s style of doing business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He knew how much the great operations of war depend upon what appear to be the most trifling details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He never lost a <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars'</measure> worth of public property while he was in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Those who imagine that all a commanding General has to do is to fight battles, make an egregious mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Some of our military popinjays seem to think that the <unclear> </unclear> of the battle-field and fuss and feathers make up the sum of military glory.
