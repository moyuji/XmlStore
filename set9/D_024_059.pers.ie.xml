On the contrary, passengers by the <rs>York</rs> train were positive in their assertions that nothing of the sort occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is probable, therefore, that the &#x0022;heavy firing&#x0022; heard at day break was neither more nor less than the reports of <orgName n="Heaven's Artillery"><persName n="Heaven,Artillery,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Heaven,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Artillery"></roleName><surname>Heaven</surname></persName>'s artillery</orgName>, which took the people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by surprise at that early hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Our information, which we regard as entirely reliable, is to the effect that a body of <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> reconnoitered the enemy's position last <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, and ascertained that the pickets of the enemy had been called in, and the troops withdrawn from the outer line of works to the strong fortifications on Glances or Point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These outer works, which are about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> this side, were entirely deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It was not deemed advisable, if, indeed, it was contemplated, to attack the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their stronghold, where they would have received additional protection from the guns on the <rs>York</rs> side of the river; therefore, after completing their observations and shelling the woods in the neighborhood the <rs>Confederates</rs> withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> A correspondent, writing on the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="4">4th instant</day></dateStruct> from near <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg, Va.</placeName>, gives us some account of affairs on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We give some extracts from his letter: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Owing to the utter demoralization of the <rs>Pennsylvania</rs> regiment of cavalry picketing in and out side of the town, it is avowed by the officers that the men are unfit for duty at any other point.--This verifies what <persName n="Campbell,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,Dorman,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName> said of them on the occasion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> raid into the place, when <rs type="role">Col.</rs> C. surrendered to our forces under <persName n="Stingler,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Stingler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Stingler</surname></persName>. <rs type="role">Col.</rs> C. said: &#x0022;I surrender, sir. My men are a act of d &mdash; d cowards&#x0022; The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> acknowledge that the cost to the <rs>Abolitionist Government</rs> of holding <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> is upwards of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>At present they do not picket more than a mile from the town, and that is on the main stage road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I have frequently been within sight and hearing of their pickets at <placeName reg="Waller's Mill">Waller's Mill</placeName> and other points around the city, and at the crack of a stick they would be off in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>And frequently have I said. &#x0022;Come on boys, let's charge them&#x0022; and they would take to their heels and flee for the woods in the greatest dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our forces in that direction have succeeded in driving them back to the burg and below it, so that now we are foraging below the <measure n="6mile" type="distance">six mile</measure> ordinary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> A short time ago the wives of the <num value="2">two</num> Hotheimer brothers (<rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>,) had succeeded in passing all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pickets except the <num value="1">one</num> on the outpost, under the pretext of going to a grist mill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Each <num value="1">one</num> of the females had a wagon load of contraband goods, (destined for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,) covered over with bags of corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The last picket alluded to being somewhat curious to know if the entire loads consisted of corn, thereupon turned <num value="1">one</num> of the bags over, and immediately there appeared to view boxes, boots, etc. Upon further examination it was ascertained that the ladies had on their persons, under their <rs n="hoop skirts" type="product">hoop skirts</rs>, arranged in fantastic order, boots shoes, bag of coffee, sugar, tea, etc, <num value="1">one</num> of the ladies having on as many as <num value="8">eight</num> <rs n="hoop skirts" type="product">hoop skirts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They were immediately taken back to the city and reported to the <name>Provost</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On this occasion the <name>Provost</name> was acting only pro tem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Therefore they were kept under a guard and made to sit upon the wagons for half a day in the cold to await adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>For sport, the ladies were made to dismount and remount the wagons without assistance, which caused the sugar, coffee, etc., to break from their proper moorings, and each time sprinkle the ground profusely with the sweet edibles, etc.--These <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>, with the assistance of <persName n="Hennessee,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hennessee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt</roleName> <surname>Hennessee</surname></persName>, had been sending through the lines quite <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure> worth of goods a week for fellow extortioners in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> made a worthy example of them by confiscating their goods in store and forwarding their persons on to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> As a matter of humiliation to the pride of the editor of the <orgName n="Williamsburg Virginia Gazette" type="newspaper">Williamsburg (Va.) <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi></orgName>, <persName n="Lively,,E.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Lively,E.,H.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Lively</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, and reflection upon the history of that paper, the oldest in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, for more than <measure n="125years" type="date">125 years</measure> the advocate of civil liberty and the right of self-government, is now under an assumed name--<hi rend="italics">Caviller</hi>--and the ban of military surveillance made to pander to the lusts of an invading horde under <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> usurpation.

<head>The last Northern movement.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> A brief article, under this title, appeared in yesterday's <hi rend="italics">Dispatch.</hi> For reasons stated, it expressed a reliance upon some of the <rs>Northern</rs> communities for some effective resistance to the establishment of a complete despotism there &mdash; annihilating every principle of States rights, and every vestige indeed of personal liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>To this was added the expression of an abiding faith in that divine overruling power which, sooner or later, will measure out justice upon the most nefarious Government on this earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>We do not desire to detract from the force of these expressions, but to add as another article the renewed declaration of a never faltering confidence in the patriotism, courage, and constancy of our own people &mdash; our own glorious <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The public sentiment at the <rs>North</rs> in opposition to the overshadowing rule of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> must find its greatest support in the victories won by the soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Were it permitted that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Myrmidons should gain a succession of victories in the <rs>South</rs>, it is probable that the voice of liberty would be silenced in the <rs>North--But</rs> a few victories on our side will give it a potency and power that will shake the <rs>Federal</rs> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>We would exhibit a remarkable incredulity if we could suppose that there existed not at the <rs>North</rs>, in some States, powerful States-rights parties, and that there were no sectional jealousies ready, on some opportunity, to break out into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>We believe that there are such parties and such jealousies, and we believe that they are aroused with increased energy by the late measures of Congress submitting to the hands of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> every power that can be reposed in man over the liberties and immunities of States and men. We believe that they will be more active and determined because of these measures, and that, encouraged by our own indomitable resistance to the effort to subjugate and enslave us, they will yet and that at no very distant day, interpose obstacles in the path of the tyrant that will aid materially in the solution of the troubles now involving these nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>These conclusions are, we think, reasonable and just; and therefore we reiterate the opinion that even in the last most desperate movement of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> is still working out the problem of the pending struggle for our advantage. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> At this moment the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is preparing a new attempt, which would be at the same time, as it hopes, a powerful means of coercion.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It is easy to see the new sufferings at the <rs>South</rs> which would result from the project submitted to you by <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>; but the planters have proven thus far that the most painful sacrifices cost them nothing in defence of their cause, and it is therefore permissible to doubt whether the success of the combined expedition on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> will suffice to induce them to surrender their crops on the conditions to be imposed on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>As regards foreigners, as regards our own citizens, experience has proven only too clearly how chimerical it would be to suppose that any respect would be paid in such a case to their neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>What is now passing at New Orleans indicates in fact sufficiently the manner in which certain commanders of Federal forces deem themselves entitled to act towards them, in spite of the different intentions entertained, we doubt not, by the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>I know already that such is also the impression of the <rs>English Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The objections which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presented themselves to your mind are conformable to our own views, and it is therefore necessary that you have very frank explanations with <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>His departure will certainly not constitute for us a solution of all the claims which his administration has provoked; but we hope that the conduct of his successor will at least prevent, for the future, any increase in their number. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="L'Euys,,Prouyn,de,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="default:L'Euys,Prouyn,de,,"><foreName>Prouyn</foreName> <foreName>de</foreName>  <surname>L'Euys</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>
