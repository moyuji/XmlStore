<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/> --We do not ask whether there are currents of cold air rushing through the doors and windows of the apartment upon the heads of the sick, who are so unfortunate as to have their beds placed, apparently, with the intention of being blown upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>This is not <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> ventilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>If we did not know to the contrary, we should suppose, from the peculiar arrangements of the beds in some of our hospitals, that the managers and nurses had adopted the best means for their patients taking cold, or for counteracting the good effects of all remedial agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Nor, is it right to exclude the air, by no means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>See that your patients have an abundant supply of pure, wholesome air; but be careful not to let that air come upon them in currents.--Have the windows to constructed that they may be pulled down a few inches from the top, that the impure and heated air may escape; whilst some of the windows can be raised a few inches at the bottom, for the purpose of allowing a sufficiency of pure air to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>When this is attended to, the next step of importance is to see that none of the beds are placed immediately under the windows, or in the draught from the doors.--Proper ventilation is of great importance to the well man; how much more so is it to the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>In the treatment of febrile diseases, and especially those of a low or typhoid grade, the curative value of pure air, properly supplied, can hardly be estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>It is ascertained by competent authorities, that a man in health requires not less than <num value="4">4</num> cubic feet of air a minute in order to maintain his healthy status.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Now, in sickness, where the exhalations from the skin and lungs, and the secretions from other organs, are morbidly altered and increased, it is apparent to every <num value="1">one</num> that the requisite amount ought to be greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>So we may safely write it down that not less than <num value="250">250</num> to <num value="280">280</num> cubic feet of pure air is necessary for the sick man every hour, that he may recuperate his wasted energies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/> As a reason for the dispatch of so large a force to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, it may be alleged by the <rs>British Government</rs> that it was in consequence of an apprehension that an attempt might be made at the annexation of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and as a simple measure of safety during the war in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>But no such explanation will be accepted by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or those in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> who are cognizant of the real objects the <rs>Government</rs> have in view &mdash; the idea of our invading <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> without the provocation of a war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> being absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>We say this because we have no doubt the <rs>Government</rs> will be asked for an explanation of a proceeding, which, judging by the parliamentary and press remarks upon the original reinforcement, is certain to provoke strong opposition in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and may not unlikely lead to a change of administration.
