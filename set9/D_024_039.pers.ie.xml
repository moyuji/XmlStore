<head>Rye coffee &mdash; its Dangers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> A case of some interest to the drinkers of &#x0022;rye&#x0022; coffee has occurred in <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn, N. Y.</placeName> Several members of a family there were seriously affected by poison, alleged to have been contained in the coffee they drank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>An examination was made by the <name>Health</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><rs type="role" reg="Officer">Officer</rs> of <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>, who discovered that the sickness was caused by the continued use of coffee made by rye, and he was confirmed in his opinion by making experiments upon a dog. He therefore ordered the police to seize the packages on sale in the store from which the family alluded to had procured the coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The following is the statement of the <rs>Health Officer</rs> in regard to the matter: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head rend="smallcaps">Health Department,</head> <opener> <dateline> <name type="place">Brooklyn,</name> <date value="1863-02-05">Feb. 5, 1863.</date> </dateline> </opener>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">1st</day></dateStruct> inst, <persName n="Palmedo,Doctor,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Palmedo,M.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Palmedo</surname></persName>, of this city, reported that the entire family and the servant of a <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> merchant had for some time previously, and still suffered from the effects of vegetable poison, alleged to have been taken with their food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I entered immediately upon the investigation of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I found <persName n="Croft,Mister,George,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Croft,George,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Croft</surname></persName>, his wife, <num value="2">two</num> of his daughters, and <num value="1">one</num> son, more or less under the influence of the supposed poison, the rest of the family being convalescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The servant had been removed to other quarters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the young ladies was very sick; her face was bloated and disfigured like the dropsy; her eyelids were greatly distended, and could scarcely be opened; her eyeballs were bloodshot, and the pupils considerably dilated; she was then under violent fever, and very restless; she complained of headache and great dizziness; she was tortured by frightful dreams, and became at times delirious; besides this there was great pain in the back and extremities, the latter were moreover benumbed; she was very weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Learning that every member of the family had been thus affected, I could not hesitate in lending my official assistance in the discovery of the alleged poisonous cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><persName n="Palmedo,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Palmedo,M.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Palmedo</surname></persName> had already instituted the most searching inquiry, and at last has fixed his suspicious upon the so-called rye coffee, which the family had made use of for the last <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure>. After due deliberation on all the attending circumstances I could not help sharing in the suspicion, as no other cause could be assigned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Ascertaining the places where the suspected articles had been bought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I possessed myself of some samples, suspended the further sale of said articles at those places until its composition and effects could be fully examined into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Chemical analysis and microscopical examinations being utterly impracticable, I resorted to experiments upon dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In preparing a strong decoction of the sample, I noticed its strong, disagreeable, and nauseating flavor, very similar to that emanating from a decoction of ergot, yet stronger in the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The animal exhibited great restlessness and weakness; his movements and position were infirm; his pulse rose within an hour from <num value="100">100</num> to <num value="160">160</num>, and even, for a short time, to <num value="172">172</num> per minute; pupils became dilated; he was evidently sick at the stomach; very <num value="30">thirty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It seemed to be conclusive that the samples used for the experiment contained noxious ingredients of a poisonous character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The case of <persName n="Croft,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Croft,George,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Croft</surname></persName>'s family is not a solitary <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I had become cognizant of numerous instances in which the rye coffee had the same or similar effects, and such complaints had been made at the store from which the samples had been purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>I have therefore, considered myself justified in condemning the stock of the article, and have ordered its destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Nobody should be surprised at the obnoxious effects of rye coffee, for with the rye itself grow ergot and other poisonous plants, and unless their seed be carefully separated from rye, poisoning is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Pure rye is certainly a cheap and innocent substitute for coffee &mdash; the adulterations alone are to be feared in the article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I hope this disclosure will teach manufacturers of the article to be more careful in the selection of the new material, otherwise the public will protect itself more effectually. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> In the prosecution of this purpose, <persName n="Zarvona,Colonel,Richard,Thomas,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Zarvona,Richard,Thomas,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Zarvona</surname></persName>, an officer, with others under his command, with the authority and by express orders from the <rs>Executive</rs> of this State, planned and executed an expedition by which the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">St. Nicholas</rs>, and other vessels belonging to the marine of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, were captured and brought as prizes into the waters of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In a subsequent expedition, undertaken under the same authority, and, while bearing on his person a commission from the <rs>Governor</rs> of this State, appointing him a Colonel of volunteers, and with orders of a warlike character, he was arrested by the police on board the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Mary Washington</rs>, on her trip to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and carried a prisoner to <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>.--From thence he has been removed, and is now confined at <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>, as a felon, in a dungeon, and subjected to the greatest inhumanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> That he was, under these circumstances, rightfully a prisoner of war is not denied, and that he might be held as such until exchanged under some cartel for the purpose, I do not controvert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He had been known to be in hostility to the <rs>Government</rs> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and was liable, therefore, to be captured wherever found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>But he was not, in any sense, to be regarded as a felon, holding as he did the <orgName n="Military Commission" type="commission">military commission of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName></orgName>, and in the execution of her military and naval orders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> If he was regarded in any other light than as a Colonel in the service of the <rs>State</rs>, then was he, in the language of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, entitled to a speedy and a public trial by an impartial jury of the <rs>State</rs> and district wherein the crime [shall have] had been committed, which district [shall] should have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> Notwithstanding this express clause, he has now been confined for <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure>, and not <num value="1">one</num> of the provisions contained in it has been attempted to be complied with. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> The only cause that I have seen assigned for his incarceration was announced in a paper printed in the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> on the <date value="1861-07-09">9th of July, 1861,</date> immediately after his arrest, in which it is stated, &#x0022;that <persName n="Thomas,Mister,Richard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Thomas,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, and <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> other persons, were arrested on board the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Mary Washington</rs>, as she was coming up the bay yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The charge against them, we believe, was that they were concerned in the seizure of the <rs>St. Nicholas</rs> a few days since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The party were coming up to the city as passengers, when they were pointed out by <num value="2">two</num> spies on board the boat, and, as she reached the wharf at <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>, the boat rounded to, and they were delivered up to the officer in command.&#x0022; If his offence was the seizure of the <rs>St. Nicholas</rs>, that seizure was accomplished by a justifiable stratagem by naval and military officers of this State, in company with Col <persName n="Zarvona,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Zarvona,Richard,Thomas,,"><surname>Zarvona</surname></persName>, and with a design to carry out a bolder and more daring military and naval enterprise, the success of which would have been beyond doubt, if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s action had not been thwarted by circumstances beyond her control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>When the <rs>St. Nicholas</rs> was taken, <persName n="Zarvona,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Zarvona,Richard,Thomas,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Zarvona</surname></persName> was an officer appointed by and in the service of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and was in <hi rend="italics">flagrante bello</hi> engaged in a hostile act, and entitled to be considered, if taken, as a prisoner of war, and if taken afterwards for the offence, then committed, he could only be so considered and so treated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> Under the cartel for the exchange of prisoners, entered into between the <name>Governments</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, all prisoners of war were to be exchanged upon certain agreed terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Why <persName n="Zarvona,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Zarvona,Richard,Thomas,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Zarvona</surname></persName> has not been exchanged under this agreement it is for the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Why he has been subjected to indignities that no other prisoner have been compelled to undergo, is not for me to consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It is sufficient for the <rs>Executive</rs> of this State to be apprised of the fact, to induce him, for the sake of humanity and for the sake of the usages of civilized nations, to ask that such severities should not be practiced upon an officer in the service of this State for his obedience to orders emanating from her authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> It is proper under all the circumstances of this case, that I should inform you distinctly of the course I have taken and the policy I intend to pursue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> Independent of the forces which have been contributed by this State to the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has a force of her own operating under command of <persName n="Floyd,Major-General,John,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="default:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-Gen.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, by whom there have been <measure n="201" type="captured">captured two hundred and one</measure> prisoners, most of whom have been brought to the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> for safe custody. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> In addition to this case of unusual and severe treatment of a prisoner of war, another and equally glaring instance has been brought to my notice &mdash; a case equally appealing to my sense of justice, and calling loudly for redress. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> Under a proclamation from the <rs>Executive</rs> of this State, calling upon the citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> to organize themselves into companies, to repel the invasion of this State by her enemies, <persName n="Duskey,Captain,Daniel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="default:Duskey,Daniel,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Duskey</surname></persName> and <persName n="Vanner,Lieutenant,Jacob,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="default:Vanner,Jacob,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>Jacob</foreName> <surname>Vanner</surname></persName>, <num value="2">two</num> patriotic officers--<num value="1">one</num> a citizen of <placeName reg="Calhoun, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,2000007">Calhoun county</placeName> and the other a citizen of <placeName reg="Jackson county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002268">Jackson county</placeName>, in this State--organized a small force and took military possession of the town of <placeName reg="Ripley, Tippah, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057359">Ripley</placeName>, in the county of <placeName reg="Jackson county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002268">Jackson</placeName>, and held it in opposition to the <rs>Federal</rs> authority and to the usurped Government in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>While so in possession of this town, they took military possession of the mails, for the purpose of ascertaining the military purposes of the enemy, as they had a right to do by the rules of warfare all over the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Sometime afterwards they were overpowered by a much larger force and required to surrender, which they refused to do until their captors &mdash; who were soldiers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--agreed that they should be treated as prisoners of war.--After this agreement was made they and the force under them surrendered, and immediately thereafter, in violation of the express stipulation to the contrary, they were taken to the city of <placeName reg="Wheeling, Ohio, West Virginia" key="tgn,7014620">Wheeling</placeName>, confined in jail there, indicted, tried and convicted, and sentenced to the <name>Penitentiary</name> for a term of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, upon the charge of robbing the mail; and they are now, and have been ever since, confined in the <name>Penitentiary</name> at the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, treated as common felons.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> Nothing but the great gallantry of <persName n="Kearney,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Kearney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kearney</surname></persName>, who had a horse shot under him while leading the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY37">37th New York</orgName> into action, his officers and men, and the steadiness of most of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Couch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Couch,nomatch:0"><surname>Couch</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, saved us from a most disastrous defeat.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>After they were once broken, however, they could not be rallied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The ground lost on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day was recovered on the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct>, and on the following morning <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, with a portion of his division, pushed forward on a reconnaissance to within <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, driving the enemy's pickets before him as he advanced.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> It is impossible to understand why a report containing facts of such interest has been so long withheld from publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>While a campaign is in progress silence may be a wise policy, but when military reasons for reticence have ceased to exist, the public has a right to know the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The history of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> campaign is yet a labyrinth of doubts which only official reports can clear up. They at least ought not to be suppressed with a view to shielding the blunders of any General, or even to hide the mistakes, if such there were, of his superiors. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

Indeed, it is a fact attested by every officer who has served in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who have fought in that State have never once crossed bayonets with any of our troops, and never once attempted to charge, unless upon an enemy already in retreat.--They have been on the other hand, repeatedly charged by our troops and upon no single occasion have they ever stood long enough for the bayonets to cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>They invariably run before our troops can come in contact with them. </p>
