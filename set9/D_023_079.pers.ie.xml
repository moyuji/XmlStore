<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It is satisfactory to find that we are not alone in our opinions, that we did right in refusing to meddle in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs, and that the people most deeply interested &mdash; namely, the <rs>Confederates</rs> themselves &mdash; are quite of the same opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is nothing in the paragraph from the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi></orgName>, which we published yesterday, but what may be thoroughly agreed to by every <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <unclear></unclear> of the writer, seemingly, is to show that the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations must either carry on a war with all their strength against the <rs>Federal States</rs>, or <unclear></unclear> entirely from interference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> This is presides the reasoning which has caused ever, sensible man in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to reject the idea of breaking the blockade, or making any other week and half and half demonstration of dislike to the continuance of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The war which may now at any time come to an end through the returning good sense of the <rs>Federal</rs>, would probably, become more desperate than ever, the chief enemy being no longer the <rs>Confederate</rs>, but the <name>Britisher</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If the <rs>North</rs> was without a navy and without a mercantile marine, several <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men would be disengaged from their accustomed pursuits, be without employment, and burning with revenge and indignation against the stymies who had thrown them helpless on the world&#x0022;</q> On the other hand, the writer remarks that <q>&#x0022;it is chiefly because the <rs>South</rs> has been blockaded that she has exhibited such wonderful power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If the <rs>Southern</rs> blockade were raised, half the people would be diverted from the industrial pursuits necessary for conducting the war to selling tobacco and cotton and money making.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> It may be suspected that in the case of this Southern writer the grapes of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention are scar, but, whatever may be his motive, he has uttered good sense on this great question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> The crisis of the civil war has come at length.--The <q>&#x0022;stunning defeat&#x0022;</q> for which <persName n="Phillips,Mister,Wendell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> prayed has certainly been inflicted. * * The war has but arrived at the point which we have anticipated as the alternative to the adoption of the policy necessary to secure success, and even to justify the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we have held that it were better to separate than to hold the <rs>South</rs> to an allegiance which could only be made a willing allegiance by the virtual submission of the <rs>North</rs> to the slave power &mdash; better not to fight at all than to fight for the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> without the abolition of slavery &mdash; and difficult, if not impossible, to conquer in the fight, if the <rs>South</rs> were to be allowed the use of the negroes as laborers in the plantation and in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>But a week ago we said if <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> could be induced to proclaim emancipation only by a series of defeats and by the presence of the enemy in the subsumable <rs>Washington</rs>, defeat and investment were to be desired rather than deprecated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It is, therefore, with no regret but for the slaughter and suffering offer in any brave men that we learn the completion of these conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Now, if ever, we presume, the <rs>President</rs> will lay aside his hesitation and make an end of postponement. * * * </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> Will it (the <rs>North</rs>) consent to send forth its youths and its middle aged men &mdash; to deport the flower of its male population &mdash; for service under <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> who are constantly out man&#x0153;uvred; who leave even their wounded in the hands of the enemy; who sustain a crushing defeat when they were confident of a decisive victory and who bring back their armies to entrenchments around their capital at the close of a campaign that was to have annihilated the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Will the <rs>North</rs> do this, while the <rs>South</rs> enjoys the unpaid services of <num value="4000000">four million</num> negroes, to <unclear></unclear> its land, to serve in its households, and to throw up its defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> Possibly, the defences of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, raised with so much care a twelvemonth ago, may prove too strong for the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and it is not unlikely that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, who seems given to engineering, and who now commands at the capital may do better behind these fortifications than he did in an aggressive campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has shown frequently a determination to resist the radicalism of his party, although his efforts to resist appeared, in the progress of events, to be giving way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The long-solicited proclamation has come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>It is virtually what the radicals desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Although they can still find fault with it, they will accept it as a hopeful sign of progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Those who desire the <rs>Union</rs> as it was and the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it is, can now expect little aid from the <rs>President</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> He has proclaimed in had, but intelligible <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, that the slaves in any State, or part of a State, in rebellion on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of <date value="1863-01">January, 1863,</date> are to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The army and navy are to recognize them as free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>He does not say that the military power shall enforce their proclaimed right to freedom; but they shall not repress any efforts the slaves make to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Here the <rs>President</rs> is not as explicit as the abolitionists would desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The army and navy are not required to aid the slaves to obtain practical freedom, but they are forbidden to put down an insurrection among slaves it <num value="1">one</num> should be started.--The right to freedom is, however, recognized; the next step is a natural <num value="1">one</num>, and will follow if the initiative is taken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> On what shadow of authority can the <rs>President</rs> rest this proclamation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Will military necessity cover an act of this sort?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Slaves cannot be set free in this State, unless they are removed from our limits; that is a constitutional provision &mdash; can it be overridden by a proclamation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>If a State cannot nullify a plain right of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, where does the <rs>Federal Government</rs> get the power to nullify the right of a State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>In our opinion the <rs>President</rs> has as much right to abolish the institution of marriage, or the laws of a State regulating the relation of parent and child, as to nullify the right of a State to regulate the relations of the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> races.--This attempt to execute laws, by trampling laws equally valid under foot, is absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>By all true interpretations of military necessity, the power dies with the necessity &mdash; it has no permanent vitality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> It may be said that individuals who are striving to overthrow the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs> have no right to complain if their constitutional rights are disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>We grant the abstract justice of that, but let us see how it is operates if it could be carried into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It is not individuals that are to be affected, but States and parts of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It is a promise that the <rs>President</rs> has no power to fulfill, and we may go a step further and say there is no power in the <rs>Government</rs> to fulfill such a promise for it has not the means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>It will require all the funds the <rs>Government</rs> can raise to put down the rebel armies; at least all that a people will be willing to furnish.--Will the loyal States shoulder the additional burden of compensating the owner for his slaves, and then colonizing them in addition? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> * * * In the name of Eternal Justice, what right has a Government to inflict penalties for disloyalty, produced by the impotency of the <rs>Government</rs> itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Let it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> show its power to protect the citizen against the despotism of the rebellion, and then punish him if he remains disloyal by constitutional penalties, not by arbitrary proclamations against laws and constitutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>We have no objection to that; and we presume they are not to be used to entice slaves from their owners, or to conceal them in their camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Let the latter be observed, and it is all we ask. There is no military necessity to interfere with the operations of the civil law in this State, unless the law is broken by the military themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> As we have said, the active, conscious rebel has no fight to complain if his constitutional rights are not secured; if he loses, it is his chosen condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>He is an enemy of the <rs>Government</rs>, and if he be a man he will ask no rights under a Constitution he tries to overthrow.
