<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The Government was founded in a confidence in the virtue and intelligence of the people; but it is built in that wise distrust which has been well characterized here as the parent of safety &mdash; safety against tyranny or abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Proper restraints and checks had been introduced in order that every department might be administered with calmness, and with a due regard to the rights of all the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Its founders had built up <num value="5">five</num> distinct barriers against encroachment, and if <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> failed, sufficient still remained to restrain the application of oppressive measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>If all fail, there is still an appeal from the faithless servants to their real masters, the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He would only give up the great experiment of confederated <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> liberty when the people said the powers of Government had been wielded to their oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>He feared that we were getting into the habit of exaggerating, grossly exaggerating, the <orgName n="Executive Office" type="office">Executive office</orgName> of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He considered it the weakest of all the departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He would undertake to say, that when the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> got possession of the <rs type="place">Presidential office</rs>, they got hold of the weakest of all, and which would, as circumstances existed previous to the election, have brought them to an untimely end, beyond all doubt or controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If they have now got possession of the <rs>Government</rs> in all its different departments, who is responsible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>At the time of the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, all the other bulwarks of the <rs>Constitution</rs> were unbroken, and who is responsible, before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man, for their abandonment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Who has withdrawn <num value="14">fourteen</num> from the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Who, but the seceding States?--He had no intention or disposition to undertake any denunciation of the seceding States, or any other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This was no time for denunciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He would rather speak of things which would make for peace than add to the distractions of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>But it was due to history that these things should be stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Why had they left us helpless and hopeless in the hands of those who they tell us are our enemies.--When he thought of the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, which all here regarded as a wrong to the entire <rs>South</rs>, and thought of the firing of a <num value="100">hundred</num> guns on the reception of the news in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, he was led to inquire if we had the earnest efforts of those people who thus rejoiced over his election to defeat him? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> We had the power of withholding the material supplies from the <rs>Government</rs>, and of compelling justice to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>This was taken from us by the action of the seceding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><milestone unit="column" n="2"/> But were we justified in abandoning the great experiment of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> liberty because of the mere carrying of an outpost?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>He felt rather disposed to rally more ardently around the broken fabric, in the hope of preserving the last and only hope of civil and religious liberty on earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> The idea seemed to be, now-a-days, to precipitate people into a revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>On this idea, our Southern brethren seem to have acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He went on to speak of the assertion that they were justified in not conferring with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, because she refused a year ago to go into a conference on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He asked if the cases were similar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>She declined a conference because, she said, the time had not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It was a very different thing to decline a conference then, to declining it as the <rs>Southern States</rs> had done, and to go into a revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had undertaken the task, with a determination to confer with nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It was common to hear that the embarrassments of business required the secession of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>How further disruption was to restore confidence to the people in this respect, he was unable to see. <num value="7">Seven</num> States had seceded <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto,</hi></foreign> and it was now for us to determine whether we would follow them or not. He denied that it was a commercial or political necessity for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to follow them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He thought he could see that time in the future, when they would find that no Government could be formed on this continent which would satisfy people who had lived under the stars and stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It might suit the fancy of some people to wander among the ruins of desolated cities, and to admire the proportion of broken arches and columns; but he preferred the walks of industry and the honor of busy life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He then drew a picture of the <orgName n="Great Union" type="union">great Union</orgName>, unbroken and undisturbed, contrasting it with the shattered Republic, and small Confederacies formed out of the different States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> In arguing the question of how <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was to get out of the <rs>Union</rs>, he illustrated by repeating an anecdote of a boy who was interrogated on the subject; his reply was that he &#x0022;guessed she would have to go by water, in a dug-out.&#x0022; It had been said that <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> would follow <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, that her voice was so potential that the people of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> would reverse their solemn decision, and go where <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> led. Would it not be at least respectful, he asked, to consult her on the subject?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>With this remark <persName n="Baldwin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Baldwin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> commenced an argument in favor of a <orgName n="Border State Conference" type="conference">Border State Conference</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>He repudiated the idea of submitting to any oppressive measures from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It was his determination, and the determination of those who thought with him, to demand and to have full and sufficient guarantees for the future, or they would have a &#x0022;row.&#x0022; They meant to present to the <rs>North</rs> the alternative, of submitting to their demand, or a peaceable separation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> The irrepressible conflict doctrine of <persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> was considered, and the speaker denied that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> was on the retreat; on the contrary he maintained with pride and pleasure that it was on the increase, and at this moment stood higher and more powerful than at any previous history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>he could remember when slavery was looked upon by Southern people as a moral incubus, but now it was regarded as a beneficent and advantageous institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He also maintained that there were now at the <rs>North</rs> more pro-slavery people than there were in the <rs>South</rs> and in the whole world beside, <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago. He believed that if slavery had been let alone by the fanatics of the <rs>North</rs>, there would not to-day have been a slave in all the broad limits of this Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>He alluded to an address delivered years ago in the city of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> by the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName>, as an illustration of the great change that had been wrought in public sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>He thanked <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that slavery now stood firmer than even before.--He then went on with a history of the <name>Abolition</name> movement at the <rs>North</rs>, commencing with a few fanatical old women and weak-minded preachers, singing Psalms and <hi rend="italics"><sic>hymes</sic></hi> and spiritual songs; then spreading among the uneducated masses, and finally the politicians got hold of it and used it as an element to secure the spoils of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He did not believe that there existed at the present time such a fanatical feeling upon the subject at the <rs>North</rs> as had been represented on this floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>If he thought the disruption of this Union would be the means of restoring public sentiment, and drawing the sections together again, he would be willing to make the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>But he did not believe any such result would follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Public sentiment at the <rs>North</rs> would no more be reached and operated upon then than now. Slavery, he charged, had been made the toy of politicians, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>; and in the great day of final account there would be a fearful reckoning for the political gamblers of both sections, who had used it as the counter in the game they were playing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> In speaking of making a bargain with the <rs>North</rs>, he said he would consent to no plan which did not involve a direct appeal to the people of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It had so happened that the <rs>North</rs> had got the majority, and the time had come for a solution of the question whether the minority should be invested with the rights of a majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The administrative power must be entrusted to the will of the majority, for this principle lay at the very foundation of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The idea had been advanced by the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName>, that the minority must have the power of expansion &mdash; the power of acquiring territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>He could not conceive how this was to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The proposition of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> proposes to settle the question as to all the present territory; but as to future acquisitions, which it could not settle, it proposed a guarantee of power, and to that extent he favored it. But while this was not acceptable to some, those who made objections had other propositions to bargain with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>As it seemed to be admitted, then, as the sentiment of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> that some bargain should be entered into with the <rs>North</rs>, he begged gentlemen to come up and join in an honorable effort in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He gave a history of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName>, which he called a most august assemblage, and in which the <rs>Northern States</rs> were represented in the proportion of <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The Northern Commissioners represented <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> States, and might therefore be regarded as fair exponents of Northern sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>They agreed upon a proposition, to which he called the attention of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He did not look upon it as a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>It had never yet had a fair chance and a fair trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>He believed that if this Convention had sent it forth as the expression of its own sentiment, the <rs>Union</rs> men would have rallied around it, and it would have ere this been received as the great measure of pacification.--A resolution which he had offered with that object in view, had failed, and he now subscribed to the report of the majority of the committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>It was, in some degree, an improvement upon the former, because it estopped the mouths of all cavilers against the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>He believed that there was no subject in regard to which the <rs>South</rs> had complained, that was not covered by the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>He maintained that they were better than the <name>Crittenden</name> propositions, and argued upon the point at some length.--With regard to territorial expansion and protection, he assumed that we had no territory now in possession which was adapted to slave labor; and even if we had, there were no surplus slaves to take there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>He alluded to the importation of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> by the <rs>South</rs>, to show that there was really a deficiency in slave labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>To disrupt the <rs>Union</rs> upon a question so devoid of policy or reason, was abject infatuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The Missouri Compromise was the great line of peace, and he looked upon it as a happy omen that every measure of adjustment proposed, maintained this line of <num value="36">36</num> <num value="30">30</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>He thought it indicated a disposition to return to the spirit and principles which actuated the fathers in the formation of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p>

<head>Cold.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/> Men anticipate a coming winter with various feelings: <num value="1">one</num> dreads the <name>Christmas</name> bills; another, the boys home for the holidays; an other, a new year anxious as the last; but all men dread the cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>I know they do, for I am a surgeon, and see much of its effects among my poorer patients; and for that reason I have to consider how we ought to treat cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Treat it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>you will say &mdash; shut the door, poke up the fire, put your soul in slippers, and your body in an easy-chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Treat it like any other unbidden guest, and shut it out. I was thinking, however, of a great class of our fellow-countrymen who go down to the sea in ships after seals and whales, or up mountains to gather in the black-faced sheep, or wander about the streets of our cities, and are picked up stiff, senseless bundles of rags, by the night-police. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> To such it matters but little that our natural philosophers deny the existence of cold &mdash; that it is merely the abstraction of a certain quantity of the heat which is indispensable to animal life &mdash; that warmth stimulates to vitality &mdash; and that if the temperature is lowered it may at last reach a point when it ceases to have any effect; but, nevertheless, these facts are interesting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> The atmosphere is always robbing us of our animal heat, which has an average temperature of <num value="98">98</num> degrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>If it did not do so, if the atmosphere were itself <num value="98">98</num> degrees, we should feel it disagreeably warm, and prefer <num value="1">one</num> much lower &mdash; say <num value="60">60</num> to <num value="65">65</num> degrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>How low the temperature of the body may be allowed to sink with impunity, is doubtful, and seems to vary with the individual; the robust and lively man evolving plenty of heat, enjoys a degree of cold which makes a lean, pink-nosed, blue lipped woman, truly a miserable spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/><persName n="Tooke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00375" reg="mostcommon:Tooke,nomatch:0"><surname>Tooke</surname></persName>, in his view of the <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russian empire</placeName>, says that drivers and horses suffer no inconvenience with the thermometer at <num value="20">20</num>--<num value="24">24</num> degrees below zero, and women stand for <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> with their draggled petticoats stiff with ice. There have been noticed, however, some circumstances which would go to show that national hardihood could not be always relied upon; for instance, in the greatest experiment of the effects of cold on man &mdash; the <rs>French</rs> retreat from <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> &mdash; the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> soldiers of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">3d Regiment</orgName> of the <name>Grenadiers</name> of the <name>Guard</name>, consisting of <num value="1787">1,787</num> men, officers and soldiers, nearly all perished, as <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> after, only <num value="41">forty-one</num> of them, including their colonel?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/><persName n="Tendal,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="mostcommon:Tendal,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Tendal</surname></persName>, who was wounded, had returned to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; while of the <num value="2">two</num> other regiments of Grenadiers, composed of men nearly all of whom were born in the south of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, a considerable number were saved.--The <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> lost, in proportion, a much larger number of men than the <rs>French</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Though many of the latter were reduced almost to nudity by the <name>Cossacks</name> having stolen their clothes, they did not die from the effects of cold in the same numbers as the <name>Northerners</name>, whom <num value="1">one</num> would have expected to brave out that dreadful campaign with greater impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>There is a singular mystery about the effects of cold &mdash; mysterious as these countries round which it consolidates its impenetrable barrier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>When your great natural philosopher calculates with extraordinary nicety the laws of heat, we cannot follow his calculations; how much more difficult, then, must it be for us surgeons to determine how much, not a whole body, but perhaps some patch of tissue, may be reduced in temperature with hope of its recovery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> Take as an example now, <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s army as it returns from <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, and let him quote from the great surgeon, <persName n="Larrey,Baron,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Larrey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Baron">Baron</roleName> <surname>Larrey</surname></persName>, no less soldier than surgeon: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> The death of the men struck by cold was preceded by pallor of the face, by a sort of idiocy, by hesitation of speech, weakness of sight, and even complete loss of sensation; and in this condition some were marched for a shorter or longer period, conducted by their comrades on their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Muscular action was visibly weakened; they reeled on their legs as if intoxicated; weakness progressed gradually till they fell down, which was a certain sign of the complete extinction of vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The continuous and rapid march of the soldiers collected into a mass obliged those who could not keep up to leave the centre of the column and keep to the sides of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Once separated from the compact body, and left to their own resources, they soon lost their equilibrium, and fell into the ditches filled with snow, from whence it was difficult to remove them; they were struck suddenly with a painful choking, passed into a lethargy, and in a few seconds ended their existence.--When on the heights of Mienedski, <num value="1">one</num> of the points of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> which seemed to me most elevated, many had bleeding from the nose. --The external air had undoubtedly become more rarefied, and no longer off ring resistance to the action of the fluids, of which the movement is constrained by the internal vital forces and the expansion of the animal heat, these fluids passed off by the points of least resistance, which are generally the mucous surfaces, especially the mucous lining of the nose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>This death (from cold) did not seem to me a painful <num value="1">one</num>; as the vital forces were gradually extinguished, they drew after them the general sensibility to external agencies, and with them disappeared the faculties of special sensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>We found almost all the persons frozen to death lying on their stomachs, and with no sign of decomposition. </p> </q><bibl n="Baron Larrey"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/> How did any escape?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/><num value="1">One</num> would think that what was cold to <num value="1">one</num> must have been equally so to the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>We see in a garden, after some severe frost, particular species of plants affected by it, but we say the others were more hardy; but here is <num value="1">one</num> species of animal suffering so unequally, as regards its individual members, as to strike the most ordinary observer with surprise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/> Now, it would seem that cold affects it only <num value="2">two</num> ways &mdash; it predisposes to the death of tissues, and it <hi rend="italics">kills.</hi> In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, the part is not more affected than that it is very cold; its temperature is greatly lowered; the contracted blood-vessels allow but little of the vital fluid to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>At this moment, it seems that but a small increase in the temperature may endanger the life of the part, or even of the whole body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Let us quote again from <persName n="Larrey,Baron,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="mostcommon:Larrey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Baron">Baron</roleName> <surname>Larrey</surname></persName>. &#x0022;Towards the end of the winter of <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">96</year></dateStruct>, when I was with the army of the <rs>Eastern Pyranees</rs>, we passed suddenly from an extremely intense cold to an elevated temperature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>A great number of the soldiers, especially those who were at the siege of <persName n="Rosas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00379" reg="mostcommon:Rosas,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosas</surname></persName>, then had their feet frozen; some advanced sentinels were even found dead at their posts in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hours of the thaw; and although we had passed <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> under the influence of the severe cold, none of the soldiers of the advanced posts of the siege presented themselves at the ambulances of the entrenchment, of which I was director-in-chief, <hi rend="italics">until the date of the thaw.</hi> So in <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>, the soldiers who for the sake of <foreign lang="fre">le petit caporal</foreign> stood patiently in the snow, did so with impunity till the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thaw, when they were attacked by gangrene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>And what is this frostbite?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It is a part in which the power of evolving heat and the circulation of the blood has been entirely destroyed; and this most easily occurs in situations at a distance from the seat of circulation &mdash; the toes, fingers, nose, ear, &#x0026;c. The part, if thin, like the ear, may be crisp and hard, ready to break off; but still these frost-bitten parts are not actually irrecoverable; they may be thawed, but, strange as it may seem, the cold man's greatest enemy is the heat he so earnestly prays for. After the battle of Eylan, the thermometer had fallen to <num value="14">fourteen</num> and <num value="15">fifteen</num> degrees below zero, but not a single soldier complained of any accident from the effect of cold, though, till the <dateStruct value="-02-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, they had passed the nights in snow, and were exposed to the hardest frost.&#x0022; <persName n="Fevrier,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="mostcommon:Fevrier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fevrier</surname></persName>, finding his enemies unaffected by his usual weapons, changed his tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>In the night of the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="9">9th</day></dateStruct>, up went the temperature to <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="5">five</num> degrees above zero, and the ever-active <name>French</name> soldiers felt themselves heavy and their feet numb, troubled with pins and needles; and on pulling off their shoes and stockings, behold the toes were black and dried, and a red blush on the instep told them that the increased temperature had been too much for their chilled extremities, and that their feet were mortifying &mdash; rotting off them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>They were suffering in large what we do in small, when we stick our cold toes to the bars of the grate in this cold, wintry weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>We get some small patch of skin inflamed by the heat, which, in its cold condition, it cannot stand, and we call the patch a chilblain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/> <persName n="Hunter,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00381" reg="default:Hunter,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> froze the ears of rabbits, then thawed them rapidly and they inflamed.--Woe, says <persName n="Larrey,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="mostcommon:Larrey,nomatch:0"><surname>Larrey</surname></persName>, woe to the man benumbed with cold, if he enter too suddenly a warm room, or come too near the fire of a bivouac!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>We lately saw a fine looking <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> girl with her feet gangrenous from cold; she had been tramping linen in a tub, and feeling them cold and numb, she stopped from it into another tub which held warm, but not by any means <hi rend="italics">hot,</hi> water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/> With regard to the treatment of frost-bitten persons, the part affected should be rubbed with cold water or snow, and then with fluids of a medium temperature, in a cold room; cautiously bring the patient into a warmer atmosphere, and administer small quantities of cordials or warm tea, then cover him up in bed, and encourage perspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Even where the patient seems quite dead, or has lain as if dead for days, you must give a fair trial to these remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>When poor Boutiliat, the <rs>French</rs> peasant, who awoke crying out for drink after his <num value="4">four</num> day's sleep in the snow, was brought to his friends, they wrapped him in <hi rend="italics">warm</hi> linen dipped in aromatic water, and this was but too probably the cause of the poor fellow's feet mortifying. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/> Now, we have said that cold may not only <hi rend="italics">predispose</hi> to the death of animals or portions of animal tissues, but it may kill them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>How it slaughters its victims, we do not exactly know; some say it paralyzes the heart; others think that the cold, to use a popular expression, drives the blood inwards, and kills by apoplexy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>The irresistible sleepiness that creeps over a person &#x0022;lost in the snow&#x0022; is well known, and has been often described; if once it is yielded to, death, under the forlorn circumstances usually present, is sure to result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>But, undoubtedly, it may kill at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Persons have been found stone-dead, standing up-right at their posts, all the machinery of life <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> having stopped at once &mdash; the mouth half open, as it was when the last groan was uttered; the limbs still in the position they assumed during life, and having undergone, through the peculiar antiseptic nature of the cold, none of the changes we find after other forms of death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/> <persName n="Warems,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="mostcommon:Warems,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Warems</surname></persName> reports to the <rs>Admiralty</rs> thus: &#x0022;In the month of <date value="1775-08">August, 1775,</date> I was sailing about <num value="77">77</num> degrees north Intitule, when, <num value="1">one</num> morning, about a mile from my vessel, I saw the sea entirely blocked up by ice. Nothing could be seen, far as the eye could reach, but mountains and beaks covered with snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>The wind soon fell to a calm, and I remained for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> in the constant expectation of being crushed by that frightful mass of ice which the slightest wind could force upon us. We had passed the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day in such anxieties, when about midnight the wind got up, and we immediately heard horrible crackling of ice, which broke and tossed about with a noise resembling thunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>That was a terrible night for us; but by the morning, the wind having become by degrees less violent, we saw the barrier of ice which was before us entirely broken up, and a large channel extending out of sight between its <num value="2">two</num> sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>The sun now shone out, and we sailed away from the northward before a light breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Suddenly, when looking at the sides of the icy channel, we saw the masts of a ship; but what was still more surprising to us, was the singular manner in which its sails were placed, and the dismantled appearance of its spars and man&#x0152;uvres. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/> &#x0022;It continued to sail on for some time, then stopping by a block of ice, it remained motionless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>I could not then resist my feelings of curiosity; I got into my gig with some of my sailors, and went towards this strange vessel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/> &#x0022;We saw, as we drew near, that it was very much damaged by the ice. Not a man was to be seen on the deck, which was covered with snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>We shouted, but no <num value="1">one</num> replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>Before getting up the side, I looked through a port-hole which was open, and saw a man seated before a table, upon which were all the necessary materials for writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Arrived on the deck, we opened the hatchway, and went down into the cabin; there we found the ship's clerk seated as we had before seen him through the port-hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>But what were our terror and astonishment when we saw that it was a corpse, and that a green damp mould covered his cheeks and forehead, and hung over his eyes, which were open! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> &#x0022;He had a pen in his hand, and the ship's log lay before him. The last lines he had written were as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/> &#x0027;It is now <measure n="17days" type="date">seventeen days</measure> since we were shut up in the ice. The fire went out yesterday, and our captain has since tried to light it again, but without success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>His wife died this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>There is no more hope&#x0027;-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/> &#x0022;My sailors kept aloof in alarm from this dead body, which seemed still living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>We entered together the <rs n="state room" type="product">state-room</rs>, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object which attracted us was the body of a woman laid on a bed, in an attitude of great and perplexed attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/><num value="1">One</num> would have said, from the freshness of her features, that she was still in life, had not the contraction of her limbs told us that she was dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>Before her a young man was seated on the floor, holding a steel in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and a flint in the other, and having before him several pieces of <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> tinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>We passed on the fore cabin, and found there several sailors laid in their hammocks, and a dog stretched out at the foot of the ladder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>It was in vain that we sought for provisions and firewood; we discovered nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Then my sailors began to say that it was an enchanted ship; and they declared their intentions of remaining but a very short time longer on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>We then, after having taken the ship's log, set out for our vessel, stricken with terror at the thought of the fatal instance we had just seen of the peril of polar navigation, in so high a degree of north latitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>On my return, I found, by comparing the documents which I had in my possession, that the vessel had been missing for <hi rend="italics"><num value="13">thirteen</num></hi> years.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl><hi rend="italics">Chamber's Journal.</hi></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/> Now, although these are extreme cases, and but seldom heard of, don't think that will excuse you, my good reader, if you see any even in this comparatively temperate country, for instance, cold or likely to be cold, and you do not your best to warm them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>Think, while you sit over the fire, or turn in the warm blankets, or button up your over-coat &mdash; think, when you have a warm grasp of a friend's hand, or feel your child's warm cheek nestle against yours &mdash; think of the heat-abstracting powers of door-steps, and common stairs, and east winds, and parish-officers, and cold-shoulders, and, if you will take my advice, let the cold of winter exhibit <num value="1">one</num> of its characteristic powers on you &mdash; let it drive the blood inwards to your heart.
