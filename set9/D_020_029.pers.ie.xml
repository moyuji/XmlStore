<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>which we had been guarding with a sleepless vigilance for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>In our advance we were exposed to the enemy's shell and ball for more than a mile before we entered the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>We advanced under the most discouraging circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The wounded also were brought out in full view of our line.--The firs appalling sight that met our vision was a wounded soldier with his left arm and a part of his left side entirely torn off from his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Wounds of various kinds presented themselves to our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Strange to say, the only encouragement we received was from some poor wounded soldiers, who as they were being carried off the field waved their hands toward the scene of conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> Owing to various impediments in our route, our lines were thrown somewhat into confusion; but the regiment was soon arranged again, drawn up in full battle array in full view of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We were held here as more spectators, awaiting further orders, and exposed, in the meanwhile, to a continual shower of the enemy's bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>When the command was given to advance, the whole regiment went in double-quick time, cheering and firing as they ran; meanwhile the flags of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> were seen right and left, advancing over every hid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> We have no words to express our admiration of the private soldiers in the ranks of the <rs>Southern Army</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They are not enlisted mercenaries; they are volunteers, and yet bear all the hardships and perils that fall to the lot of mercenary privates, and like them, thrown in the front ground in peril, and thrown in the back ground in the distribution of glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It is necessarily so, for glory, so widely diffused, bears to each man no distinguishing mark, though each has been a hero worthy <q>&#x0022;all <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> and <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> fame.&#x0022;</q> And it is because, knowing that they would have the lion's share of danger, and that the monopoly of the renown must, and perhaps ought to, fall to the more prominent figures in the canvass, to the military leaders, they rush not only with willingness but enthusiasm to the ranks, that we honor and admire the volunteer private soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> above all other men and classes of men in this <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> Century. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> We honor and respect, as all men ought, the great military chieftains, and all the subordinate officers who are qualified for their positions, but yet we look upon the private volunteer soldiers with a reverence that we feel for no official rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Their being where they are shows as just what they are. Their position saves us the trouble of analyzing their motives; they are honest as they are brave,--they are men &mdash; genuine men, the true metal, pure gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>They are no political aspirants, no military pretenders, no <q>&#x0022;fuss and feathers&#x0022;</q> humbugs; but patriots and heroes, to whom you may take off your hat, and do homage to sincerity and manliness in the most perfect combination and unquestionable shape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> With few exceptions, of worthless and reckless adventures &mdash; so few that they only establish the general rule &mdash; the volunteer privates of the <rs>Southern States</rs> are the very flower of the whole land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>In all that constitutes character, virtue and social position, the great body of these men, carrying muskets on their shoulders, sleeping often on the bare ground, and eating cheerfully the coarsest food, are equal in every respect to the highest officers by whom they are led to battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Implicit obedience to orders, which it was thought would be a difficult thing to enforce among high-spirited Southerners, has become a distinguishing characteristic of the <rs>Southern</rs> camp, whilst the very opposite prevails among the <rs>Northern</rs> soldiers, whose frequent rows and breaches of discipline are matters of constant newspaper notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The reason of the difference is that the <rs>Southern Army</rs>, the rank and file, is mostly made up of gentlemen, who have taken up arms from the purest sentiments of patriotism; who submit to the most irksome discipline on account of the cause, and whose habitual self-respect precludes the very existence of a spirit of envy and insubordination towards official superiors. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The circumstance was noticed at the time as a favorable indication, though it had no effect upon the bloody-minded <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>We append the protest of these <num value="91">ninety-one</num> true men, which is as eloquent in language as truthful in sentiment: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/> The undersigned claim their constitutional right of entering upon the journal of the <rs type="place">House</rs> this their protest against the passage of a bill entitled an <q>&#x0022;act to aid in the defence of the country,&#x0022;</q> with the following, their reasons' herefor: </p> 
<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1">1</num>.Because the bill compels us to approve, ratify, and confirm <q>&#x0022;all payments made by the <rs>Governor</rs> and Council, or by their authority and direction, in order to furnish troops from this State for the defence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or enlisting, arming, equipping, disciplining, maintaining or transporting said troops, or in any way connected therewith;&#x0022;</q> of the nature, extent, validity and equity of which we know so little as to be entirely unable to form any definite judgment relative thereto, and because from any information communicated to this <name>House</name>, we cannot assure ourselves or our constituents that it would be safe and proper for us thus to approve, ratify and confirm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2">2</num>. Because by the provisions of this bill the power to consider and determine what appropriations are necessary, and what disposition has been, and shall be, made of the money of the people, how and by what agents disbursed, and in what manner accounted for, are taken from the representatives of the people, to whom such power constitutionally be longs, and surrendered to the <rs type="place">Executive branch</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3">3</num>. Because we cannot permit transactions of any branch of the <rs>Government</rs> to be sealed up from the eyes of the people, or to be placed beyond their power to examine, inspect and judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/></item> 
<item n="4"> <num value="4">4</num>. Because we cannot regard the action of this <name>House</name> in the rejection of the amendments proposed to the bill as other than the assurance that the present war may be waged by unlawful means, for conquest, subjugation, national consolidation and the extinguishment of State sovereignties, and we are unutterably opposed to the attainment, by any means, of such objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/></item> </list> 
<p> Disavowing all considerations and motives of a partizan character, we enter our protest against this bill, because of its loose, irresponsible, extravagant provisions, and also because we desire to put upon the record our earnest will to protect the <rs>State</rs> against the exercise of a decree of executive power, such as the <rs>Constitution</rs> never contemplated and the people never before dreamed of. When such and extraordinary appropriation was submitted to our sanction, we had a right to know, and the people had a right to know, distinctly and specifically, where their money was to go, for what purposes it had been and was to go, for what purposes it had been and was to be applied, and by what suitable checks its disbursements had been and was to be guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>We cannot consent to give the idle catch phrases of the day the weight due alone to reason and argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> to which we belong has, fortunately, no occasion for new and extraordinary demonstrations of devotion to the flag of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>They have never heaped malediction upon it, or upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>This Union, which has been our pride and delight, had its birth in the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>It was only when the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself relating to domestic servitude came to be denounced and boldly repudiated, that all these great interests and precious blessings were seriously imperiled. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>We will not sanction appropriations of the people's hard earning, unheard of in amount, without figures, without facts, without sound reason as a basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>This legislation, in our judgment, does little less than to invite speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>It is vain to remind us of the old Latin maxim so often reproduced of late, that in the midst of arms the laws are silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>If we go back to the origin of that maxim, we shall find that in the midst of arms the best institutions have been overthrown, and, upon the tyrant's plea of necessity, great liberties have been crushed under the iron heel of military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>We have asked whether this war contemplates re-union, and if on, is what manner arms are to achieve the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>We have asked whether it means the desolation of Southern horses, the overthrow of Southern institutions, and the destruction of our own race there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> I observed in the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi></orgName> a statement, that our soldiers were suffering in health for the want of good bread, and a request also was made to housekeepers to send to them simple recipes for making good yeast and yeast bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Allow me to suggest an idea upon this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> In every regiment there is <num value="1">one</num>, if not many more who is by trade a baker; would it not be the best way to have that <num value="1">one</num> (or more if necessary,) to do nothing else but make good bread for that regiment, being careful to pay him well for it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Of course he must be excused from all military duty; but would he not serve his country more in providing good, healthful food for so large a number of working soldiers, than if he (or they) devoted <unclear>ll of bi</unclear> ( or their) time personally to military duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Making good bread is an art that is not easily learned by any <num value="1">one</num>--practical good judgment is as necessary to success in this department as in all other pursuits in life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/> <hi rend="italics">Yeast.</hi>--<num value="1">One</num> good handful hops, <num value="2">2</num> <num value="2">two</num> tablespoonsful salt, <num value="2">2</num> of sugar or molasses &mdash; boil in <num value="5">5</num> pints of water about half an hour, then strain; put it on the fire again and thicken while boiling hot with flour to about the consistency of thin paste; when partially cooled and yeast enough to ferment it, (say about <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> tablespoonsful of good yeast). Let it remain in an open vessel lightly, covered and in a tolerably warm place until it ferments fully, then bottle and let it stand a few hours uncovered; then cork tightly, and in <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure> it will be fit for use. It should be kept in a cool place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Use <num value="2">two</num> tablespoonsful of this yeast to a quart of flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>In the process of fermentation the water separates from the flour and you may think it is not good; but it needs only to be well shaken whenever it is used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>In warm weather this yeast should be made once a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>If you wish yeast cakes that will keep several weeks, just thicken this liquid yeast as soon as it has risen well with <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs> into a dough, roll it out nearly half an inch thick, cut into small cakes and dry them on a board in the shade, being careful to turn them frequently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>When perfectly dry, tie them up in a bag and keep them in a dry, cool place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> <hi rend="italics">Bread.</hi>--A quart of flour will make a small loaf of bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Make a dough of a quart of flour, and about half a pluto (perhaps a little more is necessary) of warm water that is tepid, a little floe salt, and <num value="2">two</num> <sic>tablespoonsful</sic> of the yeast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>After this dough is well kneaded put is in a closely covered jar, or bucket, (<rs n="stone ware" type="product">stone ware</rs> is preferable to tin,) after having previously warmed it a little by putting warm water to stand a little while in it. Cover the jar with a warm cloth or blanket and put it in a tolerably warm place to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>When the dough begins to crack at the top which will generally being but <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure>, it should be kneaded over again formed into a loaf or into rolls, and then put in the pan in which it is to be baked, and put again in a tolerably warm place to rise again &mdash; the pan should be covered with a clean cloth and the air kept from it. When the loaf commences to crack at the top, it is time to put it in the oven to bake &mdash; this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> rising will require about <num value="1.5">one and a half</num> to <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> firing it would be well to taste the dough to filled out whether it is sour &mdash; it so, a little soda, dissolved did warm water, should be kneaded into it, the proportion of half an even teaspoonful to a quart of flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>It should be baked with a moderate heat, so that the inside may be thoroughly baked before a hard crust is formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>After it is done, it should be allowed to stay a little while in a warm oven to soak, at it is familiarly called, meaning to dry a little more. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
