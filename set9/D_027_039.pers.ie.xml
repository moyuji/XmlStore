<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Persons who visited <placeName reg="Port Walthall Junction">Port Walthall Junction</placeName> inform us that dense clouds of dust could be seen in the direction of the enemy's lines, supposed to have been caused by wagon trains moving towards <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is further reported, that heavy columns of smoke were observed yesterday in the same direction, and, indeed, this was distinctly seen last evening about sundown from the <rs type="place">Petersburg depot</rs>, in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The inference is, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are burning their surplus material, preparatory to another change of base &mdash; this time, probably, to the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A scout reports that there are sufficient evidences of a considerable diminution of the <rs>Federal</rs> force in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and we would not be much surprised if the whole army, at no distant day, pulled up stakes and left, bag and baggage, for another scene of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This seems hardly possible, after their immense preparations and vain-boastings of what they were going to accomplish on that line; but the disaster of <dateStruct value="-07-30"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="30">30th</day></dateStruct> threw a damper upon the spirits of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and filled them with dismal forebodings as to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Besides, they have some apprehensions for the safety of their own capital, which may cause them to abandon present efforts for the reduction of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>His orders were to fall back and toll on <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> till he got to an admirable position, about <measure n="16miles" type="distance">sixteen miles</measure> in the rear of <placeName reg="Pleasant Hill, Cass, Missouri" key="tgn,2060118">Pleasant Hill</placeName>, where he could have had in the action the additional <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men alluded to, and would almost certainly been able, from position and numbers, to have annihilated the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The <name>English</name> people hated slavery very much; but the trade was profitable, and they never thought then, nor have they thought since, of weighing profit against humanity. &#x0022;Let <placeName reg="Glasgow, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2111926">Glasgow</placeName> flourish&#x0022; is the motto upon the town arms of that respectable city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>And <placeName reg="Glasgow, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2111926">Glasgow</placeName> did flourish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It flourished upon the blood and tears of some scores of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs>, torn annually from their homes by <persName n="Glasgow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="mostcommon:Glasgow,nomatch:0"><surname>Glasgow</surname></persName> traders, and sold into slavery in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName> and upon the <name>Continent</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Of course, now that the trade is no longer profitable, <placeName reg="Glasgow, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2111926">Glasgow</placeName> sees the enormity of the sin as clearly as <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName>, or any other community, which once found its profit in encouraging it. <placeName reg="Glasgow, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2111926">Glasgow</placeName> and <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> &mdash; and all the maritime cities of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>--according to their own showing, were great sinners at that day; but their sins were, in enormity, as white is to crimson, when compared with the crimes of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>They were the great man-stealers of the earth--&#x0022;the felons of the human race&#x0022;--as <persName n="O'Connell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:O'Connell,nomatch:0"><surname>O'Connell</surname></persName> once chose to call the slave States of this Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The <rs>English</rs> and <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> traders had some bowels of compassion; but the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>They were as destitute of such appendages as a steam engine or a spinning jenny, and they regarded the poor negro pretty much in the same light in which they regarded these implements of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>That they are engaged at this moment in the same trade of kidnapping, their own people are beginning to confess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>At a late meeting of the <name>Board</name> of Supervisors of the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">City of New York</placeName>, when a circular from the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal-General">Provost Marshal General</rs>, recommending recruiting in the rebel States was read, Supervisor <placeName key="tgn,2101155" n="1.000 48" reg="purdy, mcnairy, tennessee">Purdy</placeName> said &#x0022;he hoped the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> would never engage in the business of enlisting negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/><hi rend="italics">He characterized it as trafficking in human flesh.</hi> We are able to perform the duty of maintaining the <rs>Union</rs> <hi rend="italics">without following the example of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> in kidnap Ping poor negroes to have them slaughtered</hi> !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> Notwithstanding these amiable Supervisors passed a resolution appointing agents to recruit for the <rs type="place"><placeName reg="New York, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002715">county of New York</placeName></rs> in the rebel States, Supervisor Little (a genuine <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>) having smoothed the matter over by explaining that the object was merely to recruit the army and fill the county quota, without being obliged to resort to &#x0022;a draft of our own citizens, &#x0022; and suggesting that there were white men in the rebel States as well as black, the <hi rend="italics">real</hi> object, we presume, being too humiliating to admit of a can did acknowledgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>All this sounds well for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It is an admission that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> depend upon the negro, and upon the negro alone, for success in the attempt to subjugate the <rs>Southern States</rs>; and we have already seen what they are capable of doing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> We would specially call attention, however, to the remarks of Supervisor <placeName key="tgn,2101155" n="1.000 48" reg="purdy, mcnairy, tennessee">Purdy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The men who, of all other men upon earth, have raised the loudest clamor about trafficking in human <unclear></unclear> are the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>And what are &#x0022;the solid men of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>&#x0022; doing at this moment ? &#x0022;Trafficking in human flesh&#x0022; to an extent, and with a cruelty, unknown to any other people or any other era. The <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 7" reg="africa">Guinea</placeName> trade, by which so many of their forefathers accumulated gigantic fortunes, with all the horrors of the &#x0022;Middle Passage.&#x0022; were mercy and compassion compared to the present traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The negro imported from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 7" reg="africa">Guinea</placeName> was expected, to be sure, to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>But he was not treated cruelly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>His food was ample, his clothing sufficient, his lodging better than that of any peasantry in the world, and his labor comparatively light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>In return for his services as a laborer he was civilized, and became, from an unreclaimed savage, a social and comparatively enlightened human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He left <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> a benighted heathen, his intellect clouded, and his soul enslaved by the foul and dark superstition in which that wretched land has been involved from the earliest traces of recorded time.--He became a converted man &mdash; a Christian--and transmitted his new faith, with all its glorious hopes and glowing associations, to his children and his children's children, oven to the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/><persName n="Johnson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Bradley,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most humane men that ever existed, and, as far as his humble mean went, <num value="1">one</num> of the most actively benevolent, expressed his regret at the attempts made in his day to suppress the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade, because he regarded it as, under <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, the most powerful of all agents for the <name>Christianization</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>That it was so, we are enabled to see from the <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> upon this continent, not <num value="1">one</num> of whom believes in the superstition of the country from which his origin is derived, and <hi rend="italics">every <num value="1">one</num></hi> of whom has been, more or less, instructed in the religion of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>We are not writing a defence of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>We merely present the extenuating circumstances, and call attention to the fact that in was not an unmined evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Far from it. <num value="1000000">Millions</num> of human beings have been benefitted by it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> Contrast it with the present traffic in human flesh, driven by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>In the former case the slave was bought from some chief who held him captive, and was prepared to sacrifice him to his gods if he could not get his price for him. His condition was as miserable as that of a human being could be, and his purchase and transfer to a new country was a relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>In the latter case he is seduced or torn from a home in which he was happy, and where everything is happy around him &mdash; in which he had no fears for the future and no care for the day that was passing &mdash; in which he was at liberty to worship <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the manner best suited to his capacity, and to employ the time not occupied in the labors of the farm in any way he might think proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>In the former case he was transferred to a country in which he could be civilized and taught the <rs>Christian</rs> religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>All that was wanted of him was the service of a laborer, which was neither onerous nor accompanied with danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>In the latter case, he is kidnapped to be forced into the ranks &mdash; to be put upon forlorn hopes &mdash; to be driven, at the point of the bayonet, into such slaughter-pens as that at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, of that at <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>--to stand between his kidnappers and harm &mdash; to be used as a rampart to protect them from Confederate bullets &mdash; to be kicked, to be cuffed, to be shot like a dog &mdash; to be kicked, to be cuffed, to be shot like a dog-- to be buried in a ditch, and to be used afterwards by the kidnappers as a scapegoat to carry off their own offences of cowardice and ill-discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We leave it to any disinterested man to say whether the traffic in human flesh, against which <persName n="Clarkson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="mostcommon:Clarkson,nomatch:0"><surname>Clarkson</surname></persName> wrote and <persName n="Wilberforce,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Wilberforce,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilberforce</surname></persName> harangued &mdash; the <rs>Guinea</rs> trade we mean-- was comparable in enormity to that now practiced by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> ? As for the slave trade within the several States, or the inter-State slave trade, they do not bear mentioning on the same day. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
