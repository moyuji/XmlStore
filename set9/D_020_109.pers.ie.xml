<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> --I have not been in the writing way for some time, but cannot refrain from describing a scene which occurred here to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is known that, since his promotion, <persName n="Jackson,General,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Jackson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> has been ordered to the command of the <rs>Northwestern</rs> division; and, on to-day, he bid farewell to the gallant brigade which had won for itself and him such undying fame on the plains of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This brigade consists of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="33VARegiment">33d Virginia regiments</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>All of these regiments, except the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, were present, that being on picket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The writer of this article never expects to witness a more touching scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Drawn up in close columns stood the subaltern officers and brave men who had rushed with loud cheers into the very thickest of the bloody <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">twenty-first</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> <time>day</time>, and opposed with the combined courage and discipline of veterans the advance of the confident foe &mdash; the men who were all <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> troops, and from that <placeName key="tgn,2114970" n="1.000 1" reg="west augusta, augusta, virginia">West Augusta</placeName> to which <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Washington,John,A.,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> had looked in olden days as the last refuge of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Proudly had they vindicated the historic fame of their section at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and now they had again formed to say <q>&#x0022;good, bye&#x0022;</q> to their loved leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The glow which brightened their faces and lit up their flashing eyes in the fire of battle was gone, and sadness settled upon their sorrowful expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They looked like children separating from a father, and, striking indeed to those who saw those brave men in the battle, was the contrast in their bearing then and on to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> On the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="2">21st</day></dateStruct> they had seen their own friends and kindred fall, and sternly fought on without shedding a single tear, or subordinating the duties of patriotism to the impulses of private grief; but now no foe pressed upon them, and that softness which ever accompanies true and tested courage asserted its away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>No newspaper correspondents have daily stunned the popular ear with even justice to this glorious brigade, and, with the modesty of real merit they have not chosen to blazen their own deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But the real fact is that <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s command that day did hardly fighting and suffered more in killed and wounded than any other brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The writer of this is not attached to this brigade, but being in the battle and conversant with the facts, appeals to the lists of killed and wounded as his witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>These brave men can ask no higher testimony, and he desires no surer proof of his veracity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Other regiments would no doubt have done as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The opportunity was given <placeName key="tgn,2114970" n="1.000 1" reg="west augusta, augusta, virginia">West Augusta</placeName> and gallantly did she embrace it, as a bridegroom embraces his bride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has reason to be proud of all her troops, but to <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s brigade she owes her largest debt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The appearance of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was received with not the slightest applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The officers and men he commanded knew for what purpose they had been formed, and felt not like cheering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He has no thoughts that are not military, no ambition that is not the ambition of a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Withal, he is endow with a pre-eminently practical and powerful intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He has introduced innovations upon the established usages of camp life, the result of which must, if properly embraced, save the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of <sic>doldollars</sic> and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of lives, and insure comfort where suffering else might have to be endured. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> The innovation to which I allude is in the size and character of the camp tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Before the open end he builds a camp fire, and that makes a small tent more comfortable in the coldest winter than the large tents are in <rs type="season">autumn</rs> or <rs type="season">spring</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/><num value="1">One</num> mule can carry <num value="30">thirty</num> of these tents, (enough for <num value="2">two</num> companies.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The tent poles are <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> long, fitting into each other, fitted together, having a nail in the top, is passed through an eye-let hole at the top of each end of the tent, and a cord fastened in the ground at the rear of the tent is passed through the back of the tent at the top. There it is twisted around the nail on the rear pole, and then it is passed to the front pole and twisted around the nail on this pole, from whence it is passed to the ground and fastened to a peg.
