<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Rumors from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> are plentiful, but most of them are of an unreliable character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It was reported yesterday that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> whipped the enemy on Tuesday at <persName n="Weyer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Weyer,nomatch:0"><surname>Weyer</surname></persName>'s cave, but of <unclear>there</unclear> is no confirmation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>From all we can learn, a heavy skirmish took place on Monday at <placeName reg="Brown gap">Brown gap</placeName> since which time there has been no fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In this affair the enemy seem to have made the attack, and were repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The object of the enemy was, doubtless, to engage <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s attention while their cavalry occupied <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> and went on raids in various directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They entered <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> as we have before stated, at <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, in force variously estimated at from <num value="500">five hundred</num> to <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men. We heard nothing further from them until yesterday morning, when, between <time value="8">eight</time> and <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, a body of cavalry advanced upon <placeName reg="Waynesboro, Waynesboro, Virginia" key="tgn,2114939">Waynesboro</placeName>', on the <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central railroad</orgName>, <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> this side of <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Here they destroyed a splendid iron bridge, the best on the road, <measure n="230feet" type="distance">two hundred and thirty feet</measure> in length, and built in the most substantial manner.--They also burnt the depot, engine- houses, woodsheds, and in fact, (according to the best information at hand,) destroyed all the railroad <unclear></unclear> at the station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><placeName reg="Waynesboro, Waynesboro, Virginia" key="tgn,2114939">Waynesboro</placeName>' is at the western foot of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, on the <rs>South</rs> river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We have no account of the enemy's subsequent operations, although it is reported that a party of cavalry had gone in the direction of <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Between <placeName reg="Waynesboro, Waynesboro, Virginia" key="tgn,2114939">Waynesboro</placeName>' and <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, with the exception of the iron structure just mentioned, the only railroad bridges are of wood and trestle-work, averaging, perhaps, <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>These have probably been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>A report reached us last night that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were advancing towards the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> tunnel, but this lacks confirmation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> An impression prevails in some quarters that the enemy contemplate a raid upon <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName>. --To accomplish this, however, they must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pass through <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Brown,Mary,,,:1"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s gap, which we are confident of our ability to hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Meanwhile, although we have no positive information as to <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>'s present position, there is a report, believed to be authentic, that he has started in pursuit of the enemy, and it is hoped he will be able to punish them sufficiently to check their destructive operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We are assured by a gentleman from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> that there is no truth in the rumor of the demoralization of our army in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The men were never in better spirits, and only await their general's command to go forward and meet the foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> Parties who arrived last evening from Mechum's river inform us that all the inhabitants of <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> and vicinity, who could do so, fled on the approach of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is represented that the road between <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName> is lined with wagons, horses, cattle and negroes, their owners all seeking a place of safety; the whole presenting, as they move along, the appearance of an immense caravan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>These unfortunate people, thus driven from their homes, will doubtless locate temporarily in some of the upper counties until such time as the departure of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> (under compulsion, we hope,) shall leave them free to return. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> As a measure of prudence, the public stores at Mechum's river were yesterday removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Should the enemy happen to advance in that direction, they will find but little to gratify their thirst for plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Everything of value belonging to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> had been removed previous to the occupation of the town by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the sick and wounded were carried to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> We add the following to our list of casualties in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>: <persName n="Massie,Captain,J.,Livingston,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Massie,J.,Livingston,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Livingston</foreName> <surname>Massie</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Fluvanna Artillery" type="artillery">Fluvanna artillery</orgName>, killed; <persName n="Abell,Sergeant-Major,William,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Abell,William,M.,,"><roleName n="Sergeant-Major">Sergeant-Major</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Abell</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName>, <rs type="role" reg="acting-Adjutant">acting adjutant</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="5VACav">Fifth Virginia cavalry</orgName>, killed; <persName n="Wilson,Major,J.,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Wilson,J.,M.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="7LARegiment">Seventh Louisiana regiment</orgName>, wounded; <persName n="Minor,,Edward,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Minor,Edward,C.,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Minor</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName>, a member of the New Kent cavalry, arm shot off; <persName n="Pendleton,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Pendleton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</roleName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Adjutant General">assistant adjutant-general</rs> to <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, mortally wounded; <persName n="Duncan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Duncan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Duncan</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, killed; <persName n="Long,Lieutenant,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Long,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>, of the same State, wounded; <persName n="Lasley,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lasley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lasley</surname></persName>, <orgName type="company" n="Company K">company K</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="2VACav">Second Virginia cavalry</orgName>, and <persName n="Garth,,Hugh,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="default:Garth,Hugh,,,"><foreName>Hugh</foreName> <surname>Garth</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Albemarle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Albemarle,nomatch:0"><surname>Albemarle</surname></persName>, same company, killed; <persName n="Wills,,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="default:Wills,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Wills</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, a member of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Massie,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Massie,J.,Livingston,,"><surname>Massie</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, killed; <persName n="Gales,Major,Seaton,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="default:Gales,Seaton,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Seaton</foreName> <surname>Gales</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Since our last report no movements of importance have transpired on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Save the occasional discharge of a musket, and, at long intervals, the boom of a cannon, everything continued quiet yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>On our right, where, if anywhere, a fight has been considered imminent for several days past, the enemy show no present disposition to make any movement, and the consequence is, that our brave boys in the trenches have nothing to do but keep a sharp lookout and hold themselves ready for action at a moment's warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>There is no doubt but that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is receiving reinforcements, though in what numbers it is impossible to say.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Considering the character of the force with which he had to deal, he has, indeed, accomplished wonders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>What might he not have done had that same force been drilled and disciplined, as we still maintain that it ought to be, and as we hope it yet will be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We have not the least doubt that <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> himself would be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, were he consulted on the subject, to express himself decidedly in favor of that very system, the importance of which we are endeavoring to impress upon the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Were he in command of a powerful body of highly disciplined cavalry, we should as soon expect him to become the <name>Murat</name> of the service as any man in it. But the circumstances which mar every attempt to introduce a regular system of discipline into the ranks of our horsemen are clearly beyond his control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It is sufficient for his <hi rend="italics">glory,</hi> but not sufficient for the situation, that he has performed as much as he has done with such a force as he has. We are well aware that the cavalry of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> has rendered, on many occasions, great and valuable services, and that, generally, it has behaved well in presence of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The wonder, indeed, is that it has done so much, and fought so well, when all circumstances are taken into consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Still, it is evidently not on such a footing as it ought to be, when it is considered that it is composed of men who, without exception, are good riders, and, <hi rend="italics">almost</hi> without exception, men of high personal courage and individual character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Now, we wish to see these things &mdash; as well as those before pointed out &mdash; changed radically; and it is for this very reason that we have agitated the subject. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> How we are to have regular, highly-disciplined cavalry that will charge other cavalry <hi rend="italics">really,</hi> or infantry when broken or breaking, we do not pretend to know, nor is it our business to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>But of this we are certain, that until we <hi rend="italics">have</hi> such cavalry we shall never be able to improve a victory, and we must continue to fight the same description of long, bloody and resultless battles that have distinguished this war above any of which we know anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>No man can point to a decisive victory within <measure n="100years" type="date">one hundred years</measure> in which the cavalry did not make the decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>A beaten enemy, unless pressed to the last extremity by the cavalry, will always rally and fight it out again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The principle of adhesion is so strong in disciplined bodies that they will always rally after defeat unless means be employed to keep them asunder; and the cavalry constitutes the means thus employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We do not profess to be military men; but it is clear to us that without some change in the system we can never expect decided success, and that without decided success we cannot expect to end this war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> Many causes have conspired to destroy the discipline of our cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>To some of them we have already alluded, and others are so obvious that they do not require to be pointed out. But <num value="1">one</num> we feel especially called on to notice, and that is the system of raiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>There is nothing so certain to destroy the discipline of an army as the habit of living at free quarters in an enemy's country and plundering and appropriating according to every man's discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We are in favor of retaliating upon the enemy for injuries done to us. But such retaliation should be systematically conducted, as the conflagration of <placeName key="tgn,2087107" n="1.000 167" reg="chambersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Chambersburg</placeName> was. We would destroy every bit of property, utterly and on the spot, but not suffer the soldiers to appropriate it. If that practice be allowed, the most highly-disciplined army that ever trod the field of battle will soon become a disorderly mob. It has been tried in hundreds of instances, and has never once failed, that we are aware of, to produce the effect we ascribed to it. Raids, as they are called, upon railroads have now been fully tried both by the enemy and by ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>They have failed to the uttermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>They have never interrupted a march for a day, never cut off communication for more than a week or a fortnight, and never induced the adverse party to change his plans in the very slightest particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>They have pretty generally succeeded in destroying the discipline of the troops engaged in them, and there their success begins and ends.--They have, we doubt not, greatly aided in destroying the discipline of our cavalry both here and in the <rs>Southwest</rs>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
