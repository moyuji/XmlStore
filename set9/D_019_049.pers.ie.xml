<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It was the duty of Congress to put into the hands of the <rs>President</rs> the means for the performance of his duty, and point out the mode in which he should do it. They could not be released from this obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He repeated that the <rs>President</rs> should have the power to execute the <rs>Constitution</rs> in all its parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The highest duty of the <rs>Government</rs>, which dates anterior to all Constitutions, is to preserve its existence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>As this was a foregone conclusion, he hoped it would pass at once, to the end that the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and of the <rs>South</rs> may be aroused to the perils which menace their destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He defiantly challenged them to assume the attitude of hostility corresponding to their bloody designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He knew that the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> are resolved never to recognize the independence of the seceded States, nor surrender control over the captured forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In short, they are resolved to permit the <rs>South</rs> no other alternative but submission or subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the event of the <rs>South</rs> declining to capitulate, coercion by arms is their purpose and policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Who so bold as to deny this assertion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He desired to proclaim to the country the policy of the dominant party and incoming administration to carry slaughter and sword into the bosom of the people of the <rs>South</rs>, rather than tolerate the existence of a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The object is to chastise and subdue the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>By this bill the <rs>President</rs> may carry on against them vigorous hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In fact, it was a measure of fraternal and civil war clearly against the letter and spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>His views, he said, had been presented in no partisan sense, and without any purpose to make them the basis of his ultimate action, in case the <rs>Convention</rs> should determine to pursue a different course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>His purpose was to discuss these grave questions in such a way as to arrive at the truth; to compare opinions, and then to present the result to the <orgName n="Great Council" type="council">great council</orgName> at home, for their action.--Whatever might be his love for the <rs>Union</rs>, he had indicated that when the time should come for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to sever her connection therefrom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>he would be <num value="1">one</num> of those who would endeavor to lead her where she should go. He had come here with a desire for peace and harmony, but when all remedies failed, he should stand by those which he had expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>There were circumstances which should induce <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to pause and consider whether she should take her place by the <name>States</name> which had seceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>He had presented facts for the <rs>Convention</rs> to consider before they determined to take <num value="1">one</num> course or another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>The interests of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> were diversified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>She appealed to no king; and while cotton was represented as the interest to be looked to by those States which had seceded, there were other interests to be brought into the account by <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. --He cited statistics of the tobacco trade as <num value="1">one</num> of her material interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Those people whom we were to hold as enemies in war and in peace, were the men who purchased this great staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>If the market were cut off, where would <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> find <num value="1">one</num> o replace it. --He wanted the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to know when they left this Union, whether they would find the security which they had failed to find here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>He then read an extract from the <orgName n="Charleston Mercury" type="newspaper">Charleston <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi></orgName>, to show that measures had been engrafted on the <rs>Provisional Government</rs> which would not probably be adopted permanently; that they might have been put forth to conciliate the <rs>Border States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>He then proceeded to re-argue the question of inter-State and <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/> But if the rights of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> could not be firmly and fully established, he was ready to go wherever <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> might lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>He wanted to wait and see if the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> might not arrive at some result which would give peace to this distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>It must be no cobweb affair, but something permanent and satisfactory to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Moreover, he would see what the <rs>President</rs> about to be inaugurated would say to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>He must abandon the principles of the <rs>Chicago Platform</rs>, and pledge himself to the support and maintenance of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>He feared he would not do this; but it was our duty to act so as to show that we would not be so precipitate as to impair the moral weight of that action with the people.--He had indicated a desire, that if a <orgName n="Border States Convention" type="convention">Convention of the Border States</orgName> could be inaugurated here, without jeopardizing the interests of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, such a course should be pursued; but not otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>If it were found that delay would be fatal to her peace or security, he was ready to act with others in a different policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>No consideration should divert him from the line of his duty; but he must be satisfied, and be enabled to say to his people, that every constitutional remedy had been exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>Every feeling, and every conviction, would lead him to take his place under the folds of the flag of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>He would prefer to perish under that flag, if perish he must, to a struggle for the future under the stars and stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>He had little hope from <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00334" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>; but if he could show him that he turned his back upon the principles of his party, he would indeed deserve the thanks of all men, and feel that he was worthy to fill the place occupied by <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00335" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>He spoke of the responsibilities resting upon the body assembled here, the result of whose deliberations might decide the destiny of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>He had listened with pleasure to the gentleman from <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086267">Bedford</placeName>, and welcomed the sentiment at which he had aimed, of his loyalty to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in the event that the faint hope of restoration becomes extinguished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>He (<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S.) came from his mountain home, where cotton was not king; where the herds upon the hills were the predominating interest; yet he would be indeed a brave man who should dare attempt to invade those mountain passes with a hostile intent.--There were no people more loyal than those of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>They might maintain themselves if all the institutions of the <rs>State</rs> were swept away; but still they were true to the <rs>State</rs>, and would be true to their historic fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>They would always dare to maintain their rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/> The present was the most momentous period in the existence of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; and with her destiny was intimately connected that of other States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>He counseled the <rs>Convention</rs>, invested as it was with such power, to emulate the spirit of the <name>Revolutionary</name> patriots, and endeavor to rescue this beloved country from the pall of gloom which hangs over her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/> He looked upon the acts of Northern States as equally in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> with the acts of secession of the several Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>But he was opposed to precipitate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>He hoped that her delay would not be mistaken for submission; for if coercion were attempted, either of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or of the other Southern States, she would repel it with all her power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>All eyes were now directed towards her, as the venerable mother; and it should be made known that when her efforts for a peaceful settlement shall have failed, she will stand in the breach and interpose her body and the bodies of her noble sons &mdash; and, if need be, her daughters &mdash; to frustrate the purposes of her oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>To <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had been committed a mission of peace and reconciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The most aggrieved of all the <name>States</name>--her soil desecrated by the foot of the invader &mdash; it was her's yet to stand proudly amid the tumult, and, elevated far above it, calm, dignified, and firm &mdash; a spectacle of moral sublimity worthy of her ancient renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>She is looked to to-day as the great pacificator and mediator in this almost fratricidal strife; yet she stands with the sword in <num value="1">one</num> hand, ready to defend her rights and the rights of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and with the other she proffers the olive branch of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>She extends the symbol of peace to all who will meet and commune with her around a common altar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Her Legislature had declared against the right of coercion, and declared that if all her efforts for a peaceful solution shall fall, every consideration of honor and interest demands that she shall unite her destiny with her sister States of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Her Legislature had inaugurated a <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName>; had sent Commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, to endeavor to stay the hand of violence, and thus far they had been successful, for not <num value="1">one</num> drop of blood had yet been shed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> He prayed that peace might be restored to the distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>He had hailed the missions as the dawning of hope &mdash; and he trusted it would prove no delusive hope, but a glad assurance of the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> and a renewal of the covenant forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>But whether this resulted or not. <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> felt the proud consciousness of having done her duty; and it is not derogatory to her to say that she has and does cherish an abiding love for the <rs>Union</rs> as it was. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/> He alluded to the vast progress of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, from the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs> to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>All this domain a few weeks ago was ours, and it will still be ours, it the interests of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in the <rs>Union</rs> can be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>When considering its greatness and its glory, surpassing any that the sun ever shone upon, it was no wonder that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> still clung to the <rs>Union</rs>--though at present with weakened attachment &mdash; no wonder that she cherished the fond love of the <rs>Union</rs> as it was. But that sentiment should not be misinterpreted or misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>It should not be misconstrued into an abandonment of her own State sovereignty, or a relinquishment of her devotion to the rights of the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> The question was no longer, with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> statesmen, whether this <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName> can be preserved; but whether it can be reconstructed, and whether civil war can be averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>He thought we had been too blessed &mdash; too happy under the system of Government formed by the fathers; that we had forgotten the trials they passed through in its construction, and were unmindful of their struggles to achieve the liberties which we had been permitted to enjoy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>He prayed that Heaven might avert so dire a calamity as the down-fall of the <rs>Republic</rs> created at such a sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>But we must look to facts as they are. The Union is no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/><num value="7">Seven</num> States, have seceded, and that fact is a practical dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The silver cord is loosed and the golden bowl is broken.--He did not propose now to discuss the right of secession; but whether it existed or not, there was no power to punish a State for its exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>There was no right of coercion vested in the powers that be. Whether secession <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> were right or wrong &mdash; whether a Southern Government exists <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de fure</hi></foreign> or not, we must all come to the conclusion that it exists <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto.</hi></foreign> The repulsion of fanaticism has driven the <name>Pleiads</name> from their orbit, and nothing but the power of attraction can bring them back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The Union cannot be preserved by force.--Force did not create, and cannot re-create it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> The speaker went on to review the purposes for which the <rs>Government</rs> was formed, and said if the <rs>Constitution</rs> had failed to answer them, it had become the engine of injustice and oppression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>It could never be enforced upon a free people unwillingly and against their consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Such a Union would be the worst of tyranny &mdash; a despotism that no free or brave people ever could or would submit to. Some other mode must be resorted to, to preserve or restore the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Public sentiment at the <rs>North</rs> must be revolutionized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>The conservative men of the <rs>North</rs>--if conservatives there are &mdash; must crush out the spirit of abolitionism, their worst enemy, which has subverted the <rs>Government</rs>, and now brought us to the very verge of an awful civil war. And why was this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The South had never invaded them &mdash; never denied their rights of property, or sought to excite rebellion and insurrection among their laboring population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Were we to do this, we should be Catalysts and demons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>But the <rs>South</rs> would scorn such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>A few days would show whether this spirit of fanaticism was encouraged for the mere sake of the plunder, or whether it would be still invoked by the party in power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> It was said that the prevailing sentiment at the <rs>North</rs> is--&#x0022;The Union must and shall be preserved.&#x0022; They must not, then, make it odious, or destroy it by any measures of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>He was unalterably opposed to such a proceeding, and would regard any attempt to collect the revenue from the seceded States without their consent, or an attempt to retake the forts, as coercion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>She would not blindly rush into this Union or that, until, by fair counsel, she had ascertained where her rights would be protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>She must either stand neutral, stay with the <rs>North</rs>, or go with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>She might stand as an armed neutrality between the belligerent powers &mdash; between her Southern sisters and Northern aggressors &mdash; if events would permit her to occupy that position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>But if coercion were to be attempted <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would go out of the <rs>Union</rs>, and then look around and determine for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>She held her destiny in her own hands, and whatever it might be, he was with her, and prepared to abide it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/> The speaker then went on to show that if the <rs>Constitution</rs> gave a State no right power to secede, there was no power to coerce a seceding State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>He fortified his position by reading from the <rs>Madison Papers</rs>, (<ref n="page 761">p. 761</ref>,) and then argued that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had reserved the right to resume her sovereign power. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>What the incoming <rs>President</rs> intends to do we know not, for he is silent upon the great questions which agitate the country &mdash; silent as an oriental despot, and mysterious as the <rs>Veiled Prophet</rs> of Khorassin, and takes credit to himself for his silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>He has seen State after State secede, and has seen the country march on to the very verge of a disastrous civil war, when <num value="1">one</num> word from him might have poured oil on the troubled waters, and calmed the tumult and the storm. --Yet he spoke not that word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>No assurance comes to us from his sealed lip, to show what his future course will be. But on his way to the <rs>Federal Capital</rs> we hear mysterious givings out of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>It would have been better for him had he determined to sacrifice himself &mdash; to tender his resignation as a peace offering, than that he should attempt to coerce the <rs>South</rs>. </p>
