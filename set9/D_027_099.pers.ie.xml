<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>By this success the enemy gained some artillery, I believe the <orgName type="regiment" key="14PABattery">Fourteenth Pennsylvania battery</orgName> and some pieces of a regular battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The suddenness of the attack and its wonderful success for a short time bewildered the troops so suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>All this while the enemy kept pressing on and pouring in upon our men a rapid and murderous fire &mdash; a fire from musketry as also from artillery posted upon the bills on the opposite side of Cedar <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> Having directed a column against <persName n="Crook,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Crook,nomatch:0"><surname>Crook</surname></persName>'s forces, the enemy quickly turned his attention toward the right of the pike, where the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 19">Nineteenth corps</orgName> (<orgName n="command"><persName n="Emory,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Emory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Emory</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>) was gotten into line and his artillery to work at short range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>At this time a bold charge was made by the enemy under cover of his guns to capture <orgName n="artillery"><persName n="Emory,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Emory,nomatch:0"><surname>Emory</surname></persName>'s artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In a measure this charge was successful, although it was resisted with great vigor and by a fire that would have done credit to the best of veterans under the most trying circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In the charge the rebels took <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> pieces of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1MEBattery">First Maine battery</orgName> and I believe a portion of the <placeName key="tgn,2111072" n="1.000 5" reg="chase city, mecklenburg, virginia">Chase</placeName> battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>What most helped the rebels was the exact range which they got of our pieces &mdash; the ones captured &mdash; from the elevated, commanding position on the opposite side of the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> As soon as the fight commenced, and it was known how the left had suffered, the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 6">Sixth corps</orgName> passed from its position of reserve over to where the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 8">Eighth corps</orgName> was located in the commencement of the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The trains, too, were got out as speedily as possible, taking the pike road to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, where they arrived in safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The enemy, discovering the success of his surprise, and believing that it was now for him only to triumphantly advance, (and, by the way, I must mention that it was now broad daylight,) brought his columns and artillery across Cedar <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> to press the pursuit with vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>While this was being done, and a brief full prevailed, our line was contracted, and commenced slowly falling back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Several others are reported slightly wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The attack commenced about <time value="3pm">3 P. M.</time>, and the opening is thus described by an eye-witness: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>He answered, &#x0022;You are joking, boys.&#x0022; They fired and he fell, weltering in his blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Our informant saw him throw up his hands and then sink on the ground, and then he realized for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the village was attacked by an organized body of men, bent on pillage and regardless of human life. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> Meanwhile the attack had been simultaneous on the <num value="3">three</num> banks &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> National, <placeName reg="Franklin, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002160">Franklin County</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2109978" n="1.000 4" reg="saint albans, franklin, vermont">St. Albans</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Parties entered each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>When the teller, or cashier, suspecting no evil, asked what they desired, the leader presented a pistol, with the exclamation, &#x0022;You are my prisoner; if you move an inch we'll blow you through,&#x0022; Others of the gang then went to the vault and drawers and laid violent hands on all the specie, bills and other articles which they could find, and filled the side satchels, which each wore, as we before described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Of course resistance was useless, for the surprise was complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>At the <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=25">Franklin County</placeName> Bank the raiders pushed the cashier, <persName n="Beardsley,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Beardsley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beardsley</surname></persName>, and <num value="1">one</num> of the clerks, into the vault and locked them up, and the prisoners were not released until late in the night. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Windows were broken, blinds chipped and people wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It was a scene that beggars all description. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> Of course the entire populace rushed into the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>They had no idea of the cause of the disturbance, for they were engaged in their usual daily avocations, and the raid was &#x0022;like thunder from a clear sky.&#x0022; The guerrillas, as they rushed through the town, stopped all the citizens they met and gathered them in squads under guard of a few men, armed with pistols, retaining them as prisoners, on the common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> Meanwhile their threats were terrible. &#x0022;We will burn your damned town,&#x0022; they said. &#x0022;We will treat you as the people of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> were treated.&#x0022;--They also said, &#x0022;We are coming back again, and will burn every town in <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>.&#x0022; Their imprecations were of a blasphemous character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The guerrillas, having all secured horses and saddles, commenced their retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>They abandoned the prisoners and rode off northward, firing their pistols as they proceeded. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That there is nothing in the present aspect of public affairs to cause any abatement of our seal in the prosecution of the war to the accomplishment of a peace based on the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>And to give encouragement to our brave soldiers in the field and to strengthen the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities in the pursuit of this desirable end, we will use our best exertions to increase the effective force of our armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the interests of each of our States are identical in the present struggle for self-government, and wisdom and true patriotism dictate that the military forces of each should aid the others against invasion and subjugation, and for this purpose we will recommend to our several legislatures to repeal all such laws as prohibit the executives from sending their forces beyond their respective limits, in order that they may render temporary service wherever most urgently required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That whilst it is our purpose to use every exertion to increase the strength and efficiency of our State and <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName>, we respectfully and earnestly request that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities will send to the field every able-bodied man, without exception, in any of its various departments, whose place can be filled by either disabled officers and soldiers, senior reserves or negroes, and dispense with the use of all provost and post guard, except in important cities, or localities where the presence of large bodies of troops make them necessary, and with all passport agents upon railroads not in the immediate vicinity of the armies, as we consider these agents an unnecessary annoyance to good citizens and of no possible benefit to the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That we recommend our respective legislatures to pass stringent laws for the arrest and return to their commands of all deserters and stragglers from the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> or State troops, and that it be made the special duty, under appropriate penalties, of all civil and military officers to arrest and deliver to the proper authorities all such delinquents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> And whereas, the public enemy having proclaimed the freedom of our slaves, are foreign into their armies the able-bodied portion thereof, the more effectually to wage their cruel and bloody war against us; therefore be it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That it is the true policy and obvious duty of all slave owners timely to remove their slaves from the line of the enemy's approach, and especially those able to bear arms; and when they shall fail to do so, that it should be made the duty of the proper authorities to enforce the performance of this duty, and to give to such owners all necessary assistance as far as practicable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the course of the enemy in appropriating our slaves who happen to fall in their hands to purposes of war, seems to justify a change of policy on our part; and whilst owners of slaves, under the circumstances, should freely yield them to their country, we recommend to our authorities, under proper regulations, to appropriate such part of them to the public service as may be required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the <name>States</name> have the right to export such productions and to import such supplies as may be necessary for State use, or for the comfort or support of their troops in service, upon any vessel or vessels owned or chartered by them; and vessel or vessels owned or chartered by them; and that we request Congress at its next session to pass laws removing all restrictions which have been imposed by Confederate authority upon such exports or imports by the <name>States</name>. </p>
