<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>It was not surprising that the calm and truthful communication of the <rs>President</rs> should excite <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s malignity, and that he should style it a &#x0022;white-washing&#x0022; message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Had the <rs>President</rs> recited as true the falsehoods relative to Southern cruelties to the blacks, and Southern disloyalty, which have been invented and circulated to help on the agitation against restoration, and for the degradation of the <rs>Southern</rs> white man, it would have been a marvelous proper document for <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>.</hi> Our gratification being in proportion to that gentleman's discontent, of course we hail the short message with satisfaction. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>It is a pretty good hint to them that their proffered assistance is altogether uncalled for. They might be told, in addition, with equal truth, that their interference will only make the freedman worse off and more miserable than he is. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>It fell like a bomb in the midst of the agitators, who are endeavoring to prolong the troubles of the country and perpetuate the hate between the <num value="2">two</num> great sections of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>He declares that, after his tour through the <rs>Southern States</rs>, he is convinced that the mass of thinking men of the <rs>South</rs> &#x0022;accept the present situation of affairs in good faith,&#x0022; and that they consider the questions of slavery and State rights &mdash; the right of a State to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>--&#x0022;as settled forever. &#x0022; So perfect and general does he represent the acquiescence of the <rs>South</rs> in the authority of the <rs>Government</rs>, that &#x0022;the mere presence of a military force, without regard to numbers, is sufficient to maintain order.&#x0022; Even this, we are sure, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName></hi> does not consider necessary for the preservation of order among the <hi rend="italics">white</hi> citizens; for, in the next paragraph to that containing this remark, he states that the <rs>Southern</rs> people, whilst in the work of reconstruction, &#x0022;want and require <hi rend="italics">protection</hi> from the <rs>Government</rs>.&#x0022; He recommends that, in affording this protection, <hi rend="italics">white troops</hi> alone be sent into the rural districts and elsewhere, except forts upon the sea-coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>He urges, among other reasons why black troops should not be sent, that they &#x0022;demoralize labor, both by their advice and by furnishing in their camps a resort for the freedmen for long distances around. * * The late slave seems to be imbued with the idea that the <hi rend="italics">property of his late <rs type="role" reg="Master">master</rs> should, by right, belong to him;</hi> at least, <hi rend="italics">should have no protection from the colored soldier.</hi>&#x0022; This shows plainly what is <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s</hi> view of the necessity of the presence of the military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>This &#x0022;idea&#x0022; of the &#x0022;late slave,&#x0022; which has been widely disseminated in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName></hi> believes has come from the agents of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Freedmen's Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</placeName>;</hi> an institution which he frankly states has been conducted neither with good judgment nor economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Whilst he believes that the majority of the agents of this bureau advise the freedmen that &#x0022;by his own labor he must expect to live, &#x0022; the <rs>General</rs> is &#x0022;sorry to say the freedman's mind does not seem to be disabused of the idea that the freedman has the right to live <hi rend="italics">without care or provision for the future.&#x0022;</hi> This evil idea is producing idleness and filling the camps and cities, and he thinks, in such cases, &#x0022;disease and vice will tend to the extermination or great reduction of the colored race.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> With your approval and also that of the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary of War">honorable Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>I left <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="2">27th</day></dateStruct> of last month for the purpose of making a tour of inspection through some of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, or States Lately in rebellion, and to see what changes were necessary to be made in the disposition of the military forces of the country, how these forces could be reduced, and expenses curtailed, etc., and to learn as far as possible the feelings and intentions of the citizens of those States towards the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> being so accessible to <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>, and information from this quarter, therefore, being readily obtained, I hastened through the <rs>State</rs> without conversing or meeting with any of its citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>In <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName>, <name type="state" n="North Carolina"><placeName key="tgn,7007709" n="1.000 4" reg="north carolina">North Carolina</placeName></name>, I spent <num value="1">one</num> day; in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>, <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>: <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> and <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta, Georgia</placeName>, each <num value="1">one</num> day. Both in travelling and whilst stopping, I saw much and conversed freely with the citizens of those States, as well as with officers of the army who have been stationed among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The following are the conclusions come to by me: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> I am satisfied that the mass of thinking men of the <rs>South</rs> accept the present situation of affairs in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The questions which have heretofore divided the sentiments of the people of the <num value="2">two</num> sections &mdash; slavery and State rights, or the right of a State to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>--they regard as having been settled forever by the highest tribunal &mdash; arms &mdash; that man can resort to. I was pleased to learn from the leading men whom I met that they not only accepted the decision arrived at as final, but that now the smoke of battle has cleared away, and time has been given for reflection, that this decision has been a fortunate <num value="1">one</num> for the whole country, they receiving the like benefits from it with those who opposed them in the field and in the cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> <measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> of war, during which law was executed only at the point of the bayonet throughout the <name>States</name> in rebellion, have left the people, possibly, in condition not to yield that ready obedience to civil authority the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people have generally been in the habit of yielding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>This would render the presence of small garrisons throughout those States necessary until such time as labor returns to its proper channel and civil authority is fully established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>I did not meet any <num value="1">one</num>, either those holding places under the <rs>Government</rs> or citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, who think it practicable to withdraw the military from the <rs>South</rs> at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The white and the black mutually require the protection of the <rs>General Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> There is such universal acquiescence in the authority of the <rs>General Government</rs> throughout the portions of the country visited by me that the mere presence of a military force, without regard to numbers, is sufficient to maintain order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The good of the country and economy require that the force kept in the interior, where there are many freedmen, (elsewhere in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, than at forts upon the sea coast, no force is necessary) should all be white troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The reasons for this are obvious, without mentioning any of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The presence of black troops, lately slaves, demoralizes labor, both by their advice, and by furnishing in their camps a resort for the freedmen for long distances around.--<persName n="White,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><surname>White</surname></persName> troops generally excite no opposition, and, therefore, a small number of them can maintain order in a given district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Colored troops must be kept in bodies sufficient to defend themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>It is not the thinking men who would use violence towards any class of troops sent among them by the <rs>General Government</rs>, but the ignorant in some places might; and the late slave seems to be imbued with the idea that the property of his late <rs type="role" reg="Master">master</rs> should by right belong to him &mdash; at least, should have no protection from the colored soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>There is danger of collisions being brought on by such causes. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> My observations lead me to the conclusion that the citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs> are anxious to return to self-government within the <rs>Union</rs> as soon as possible; that whilst reconstructing, they want and require protection from the <rs>Government</rs>; that they are in earnest in wishing to do what they think is required by the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; not humiliating to them as citizens &mdash; and that if such a course was pointed out, they would pursue it in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It is to be regretted that there cannot be a greater commingling at this time between the citizens of the <num value="2">two</num> sections, and particularly of those entrusted with the law-making power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> I did not give the operations of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> that attention I would have done if more time had been at my disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Conversations on the subject, however, with officers connected with the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> lead me to think that in some of the <name>States</name> its affairs have not been conducted with good judgment or economy, and that the belief, widely spread among the freedmen of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, that the lands of their former owners will, at least, in part, be divided among them, has come from the agents of this Bureau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>This belief is seriously interfering with the willingness of the freedmen to make contracts for the coming year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>In some form, the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> is an absolute necessity until civil law is established and enforced, securing to the freedmen their rights and full protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>At present, however, it is independent of the military establishment of the country, and seems to be operated by the different agents of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> according to their individual notions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Everywhere <persName n="Howard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Howard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, the able head of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>, made friends by the just and fair instructions and advice he gave; but the complaint in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> was, that when he left, things went on as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Many, perhaps the majority of the agents of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs>, advise the freedmen that by their own industry they must expect to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>To this end they endeavor to secure employment for them, and to see that both contracting parties comply with their engagements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>In some instances, I am sorry to say, the freedman's mind does not seem to be disabused of the idea that the freedman has a right to live without care or provision for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The effect of the belief in division of land is idleness and accumulation in camps, towns, and cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>In such cases I think it will be found that vice and disease will tend to the extermination or great reduction of the colored race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It cannot be expected that the opinions held by men at the <rs>South</rs> for years can be changed in a day, and therefore the freedmen require for a few years not only laws to protect them, but the fostering care of those who will give them good counsel, and in whom they rely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> The <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs>, being separated from the military establishment of the country, acquires all the expense of a separate organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/><num value="1">One</num> does not necessarily know what the other is doing, or what order they are acting under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It seems to me this could be corrected by regarding every officer on duty with troops in the <rs>Southern States</rs> as agents of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs>, and then have all orders from the head of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> sent through department commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>This would create a responsibility that would secure uniformity of action throughout the <rs>South</rs>, would insure the orders and instructions from the head of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> being carried out, and would relieve from duty and pay a large number of employees of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> <closer> <salute>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant.</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Grant,,U.,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="default:Grant,U.,S.,,"><foreName>U.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName>  <surname>Grant</surname></persName>,</signed> <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>. </closer> </div5> </div4> </div3>
