<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The situation remains the same as at the date of my last letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The enemy still holds <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>, <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2604791" n="1.000 1" reg="raccoon mountain, marion, tennessee">Raccoon Mountain</placeName>, and the railroad and river from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName> to a point within <placeName><distance reg="1mile">one mile</distance> of <placeName key="possibilities=46" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Lookout point</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>No further effort has been made to dislodge him since the unsuccessful attempt of <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Had the attack been made in sufficient force the day after the <rs>Federals</rs> got possession of the ferry and threw a bridge over the river, as it is reported <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> ordered to be made, or even on the succeeding day, which was <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, it is possible we might still have remained masters of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But the assault was postponed until <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, and was then made by a single brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In the meantime, considerable reinforcements had arrived (<dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>) from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, and it was against these reinforcements, and not the forces at the ferry, that <persName n="Jenkins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>'s attack was directed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> As was stated in a recent letter, the enemy now hold <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>, lying between the mountain of that name and <placeName key="tgn,2604791" n="1.000 1" reg="raccoon mountain, marion, tennessee">Raccoon mountain</placeName>, and the entire line of the <orgName n="Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad" type="railroad">Nashville and Chattanooga railroad</orgName>, from <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> to a point distant from <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Brown,nomatch:0"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s ferry, not more than <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure>. He holds also the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, from the ferry down to <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Since getting possession of the valley he has fortified his position, and it is already almost, if not quite, as strong as that at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In his front, as he faces towards <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout mountain</placeName>, is Lookout <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, which is too near his works for us to attempt to bridge it, and in his rear and on his flanks are the river and <placeName key="tgn,2604791" n="1.000 1" reg="raccoon mountain, marion, tennessee">Raccoon mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This is not all. If attacked in the valley he can be reinforced from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> by means of his pontoon bridges, and recross <placeName reg="Moccasin bend">Moccasin bend</placeName> more rapidly and safely than we could reinforce our column of attack; for our reinforcements would have to pass around the north end of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout mountain</placeName>, where they would be exposed to the fire of the <placeName reg="Moccasin, Wayne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100441">Moccasin</placeName> batteries and the works in the vicinity of the ferry.

<head>The finances.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> We observe with pleasure that the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> continues to press the idea, originally suggested by this paper, of a loan from the whole people, after the fashion of that made in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName> I <persName n="Weare,,H.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="default:Weare,H.,,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Weare</surname></persName> the better pleased with this circumstance, that the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> is supposed, with what justice we know not, to be deep in the confidence of the <rs>Executive</rs>, and that the project may therefore have received attention in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Confident are we that, if fully embraced by the <rs>President</rs> and recommended to the attention of Congress, it would receive all the sanction that may be necessary from that body, although we are unable to see that any is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>We do not believe that the cotton loan will ever be taken as it is being disposed of now. The bonds are selling at <num value="150">150</num> to <num value="175">175</num>, so we hear; and if they are not now, must soon become objects of speculation and stock-jobbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>A few, comparatively, will be sold in this way, at high privies, and there the transactions will cease, without accomplishing the object, being always liable to the effects of sudden panic and the various other causes that produce fluctuations in the stock market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>If the <rs>President</rs> would issue his proclamation, calling upon the people at large &mdash; all of them &mdash; every <num value="1">one</num> of them, to the extent of his or her ability &mdash; to come forward and stand by their country, we feel confident that there would be a universal rally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The whole amount would soon be taken in small sums, and as far as it went the treasury would be believed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/> This, however, we should regard as a temporary expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The necessity of resorting to it at all is this: We believe that the finances can ultimately be saved only by direct taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Every other plan we regard as a mere expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>But a tax bill of that size and character could not pass Congress under <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, for <num value="2">two</num> reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>No body of men that ever was assembled was ever accursed with the rage for talking as our last Congress, and this, we do not think, will be any better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>There were members of that body who did not miss <num value="1">one</num> day of its <num value="2">two</num> sessions making at least <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> speech, and most commonly half a dozen at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>This they did, and this they will do, although confident that they may destroy the <rs>Government</rs> by the delay they occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>To propose any measure to such a body is to put off its enactment into law to the last possible moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>In the meantime, while they are debating, the issues of new notes go on at the rate of <measure n="50000000dollars" type="currency">$50,000,000</measure> per month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>By the time they would stop talking and pass a tax bill the country would be <measure n="300000000dollars" type="currency">$300,000,000</measure> more in debt than it was when they began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Besides, there are few Curtail in Congress.--The large majority would vote against any bill &mdash; no matter if it was necessary to save the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> &mdash; if they thought it would lose them votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>They would delay, and hesitate, and postpone, until it became too late, that they might learn how their popularity might be affected at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Here, are <num value="2">two</num> causes of delay &mdash; the love of talking and the fear of losing votes &mdash; that would inevitably postpone the passage of any tax bill to the last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>But the finances want immediate relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>They want at least a sum of money equal to the sum which the <name>Treasury</name> will issue between this time and that of passing the tax bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>This Confederate loan will bring in that sum and keep down the circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>We hope, most sincerely, the <rs>President</rs> will pay some attention to this proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>As we have said more than once, he has never called on the people yet that they did not respond to the call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>We hope he will try it in this case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> If we believed that our Congress was such a body as we should think this tremendous revolution ought to call forth, we should feel not the least uneasiness about the finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>But it was the curse of the old Union that it made demagogues of every man that offered himself for a public station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The curse clings to us still, and we have fears always for the fate of even the most necessary measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>This measure of a tax for retiring the circulation we hold to be of that character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>If we do not wish the <rs>Government</rs> to become bankrupt, we must come to that at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>All other expedients &mdash; some of them good enough &mdash; we hold to be merely temporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>This will be the final resort, and it will restore credit at once; for that Government <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have credit which dare tax its people to that extent, knowing that they will submit to it to save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The property of the country is <measure n="20000000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000,000</measure> Confederate currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>A tax of <num value="0.03">three percent.</num> will give <measure n="600000000dollars" type="currency">$600,000,000</measure>. This will be called a forced loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>In some sense, every tax is a forced loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>This is the least objectionable, because it falls on all alike. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It has at least a moral weight in the contest, and may in the end produce practical results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Such as it is, the fact of <name>English</name> sympathy with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause is undeniable, and we do not know that it is more barren than the sympathies of a good many of our own people, who would knock a man down if he denied their loyalty to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and yet by speculation and <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> high prices, by subordinating their sympathies to their interests, are doing their best to crush the very life-blood out of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> Even the matter of the &#x0022;rams&#x0022; has no bearing whatever on the question of <name>English</name> sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>It is by no means certain as yet that the rams will not be forthcoming; but even if they are not, that is the work of the <rs>Government</rs>, not the people.--Even the <rs>Government</rs> admits that ships like the <rs>Alabama</rs> may be constructed in <name>English</name> shipyards, and we may well doubt whether such ships will not inflict more damage upon the enemy than the untried rams, unfit as they are for ocean combats, and inferior in the thickness of their iron coating to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> monitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>At all events, the homely adage, &#x0022;half a loaf is better than no bread, &#x0022; may reconcile us to a sympathy which, if it does not furnish all, at least produces Alabamas, and sweep <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce from the ocean. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
