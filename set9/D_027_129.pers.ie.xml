<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>There was considerable shelling of <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap by our batteries, and it was reported that <persName n="Pickett,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pickett</surname></persName>, from his lines south of Battery <persName n="Howlett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Howlett,nomatch:0"><surname>Howlett</surname></persName>, had also opened with his cannon upon the enemy in his front, who are believed to be mostly negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It is also said that picket firing has been actively resumed on this part of the lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> It was reported on yesterday that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had sent off a considerable body of troops to co- operate with <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6199" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName>, and to aid that General in reaching and establishing a base on the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>We do not vouch for this rumor, but must say there is nothing improbable in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It is just possible that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s coming to grief might not be disagreeable to him. That General has already acquired so much of glory as to become a dangerous rival as a candidate for the next Presidency &mdash; a reason sufficient to prevent <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s regretting any ill luck that may now befall him. But, as <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has gained much reputation and glory by his campaign, so has <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> gained little of either; and it is highly important to him to do something before the close of the year.

He must do something quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We may, therefore, if the weather permit, expect an early demonstration on both our wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We say on both wings, because we have no faith in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> statement that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s canal is nearly completed; and without the aid of this canal, there is not much likelihood that any attempt will be made upon our centre.--We speak of this prospect most cheerfully, as we believe our army was never before so well prepared for battle. </p>

<div3 type="article" n="1"> 
<head></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> The great tactician of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> does not appear to agree with <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> with regard to the rate at which it is proper for his column to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>He entertained no doubt that, on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="2">20th</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was in <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, having passed over the intervening distance of <measure n="170miles" type="distance">one hundred and seventy miles</measure> in <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure>; that is to say, having marched somewhat more than <measure n="21miles" type="distance">twenty-one miles</measure> <hi rend="italics">per diem.</hi> <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, on the contrary, in his general orders, prescribes a march of <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> a day, and he does not appear to have been able to do even that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>At least, we do not learn that he is in <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, as he ought to have been a week ago if that pace had been preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Indeed, we very much doubt whether he has been able to reach as much as <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> <hi rend="italics">per diem.</hi> This is a slow rate for a flying column, as <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was supposed to have converted his army into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It would seem to indicate that he had not found the people as complaisant as he expected them to be when he cut himself loose from his base and destroyed all communication with his rear by tearing up the railroads and burning the towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Even <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> a day is slow traveling for a flying column; and we are led, with a contemporary, to doubt whether <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> meant to place his army in that category.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>A flying column, from its very name, would seem to indicate a rapidity of movement entirely inconsistent with <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s prescribed daily march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>He must have meant something more solid than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers gave him credit for. His proposal to <persName n="Brown,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="mostcommon:Brown,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, last summer, give evidence of a fixed belief on his part that <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> was ready to fly into the arms of the <rs>Union</rs> as soon as her people could feel themselves secure under the protection of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The whole tone of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press has been of the same character, and the probability is, that the idea was derived from <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> himself, or from persons about him supposed to know his opinions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> There is another theory to account for <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s expedition, but not for the slow rate which he prescribes to its movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is that the operations of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> upon his rear rendered it utterly impossible for him to retain his position at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>That he was compelled to move from <hi rend="italics">that</hi> locality and to go <hi rend="italics">somewhere.</hi> That he had the choice of either <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> or <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and that he preferred the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>That there is a great deal of truth in this supposition is evident enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The care which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers take to represent the movement of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> as ineffectual and despicable &mdash; the ridicule which they cast upon his present position &mdash; their constant declaration that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,Anne,,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> is more than a match for him, and that he has failed entirely &mdash; prove it beyond a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>He has not failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>He has <sic>suceeeded</sic> in placing <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in a most embarrassing situation &mdash; a situation from which he could only escape by a desperate plunge, which he has taken, and the effect of which we shall very shortly witness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> We know nothing of the councils or designs of the authorities; but we cannot help strongly suspecting that this movement of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> has had the exact effect that it was designed to have, and that this movement of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> is a legitimate and calculated consequence.--We express this belief without knowing what, or whether any, provision has been made for resisting the advance of the latter, but from the consideration that, if <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> reach the ocean, he will leave the whole country behind him, from the ocean to the western boundary of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, clear of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The entire <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">State of Georgia</placeName>, and the lower part of the <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">State of Alabama</placeName>, will, in that event, be without the presence of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>He cannot hold the <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">State of Georgia</placeName> by means of posts, for he has but <num value="55000">fifty-five thousand</num> men; and should he destroy all the railroads, they will soon be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Should he reach the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and, as we suggested several days ago, sail thence to join <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> or <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, still he will leave the whole country free behind him. His expedition, let it terminate as it may, will but have added another to the already existing proofs that it is impossible for an army to keep down a people scattered over such an immense surface of country as ours. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
