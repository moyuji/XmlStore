<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> We must do the New York press the justice to say that, so far as we have been, it treats the disasters of the <rs>Federals</rs> with sufficient fairness.--Though, to a certain extent, echoing the mendacious bulletins of the <rs>Government</rs>, and the pompous addresses of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, it is still independent enough, and honest enough, to let the country understand the whole truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>While <persName n="Falstaff,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Falstaff,nomatch:0"><surname>Falstaff</surname></persName> and Boabdil describe their exploits, the newspaper correspondents quietly explain matters in a manner that has filled the <rs>Northern</rs> cities with consternation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Since these battles hardly a single prediction has been hazarded of the ultimate conquest of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Exhortations to persevere, to send reinforcements, to deliver the <rs>Federal</rs> army from its difficulties, to avenge the dishonor of its flag by a triumphant entry into <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, have, of course, been plentiful, but, as to anything further, there is a dead and most portentous silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In fact, it is feet that the defeat of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> has changed everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>But a fortnight before, a vast and well provided force was investing the capital city of the <rs>South</rs>, defended, as it was thought, only by a few starving regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>All was joy and ignorant confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Now the truth is revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A whole population is seen to have risen in arms; enthusiasm and devotion have made good all deficiencies; <rs type="role" reg="General">Generals</rs> of consummate skill are at the head of a soldiery of fanatical courage, and an army equal to the greatest of those with which <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> rulers make war, guards the frontier of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, after having crushed the main force of the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The Northerners, though they have shown themselves more liable to delusion than any <num value="1">one</num> could have believed of such a people, are not fools; and, in spite of the boasting and lying of their Government, they are receiving the conviction that such a people as the <rs>Confederates</rs> can never be subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If it were a war for a fortress or a frontier, they would not be discouraged; but when they reflect on the object of the present invasion, and remember that they have undertaken not only to defeat the armies of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, but to utterly destroy them, to occupy the whole Southern territory and garrison it, year after year with a standing army of at least <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, it may well be imagined that they are cooled and sobered by the prospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We cannot but think that a great change of feeling is likely to take place at the <rs>North</rs>.--The undercurrents of the popular mind are at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> not visible; it is only when they have gained volume and strength that they can change the course of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>But there is enough to show that multitudes of the <rs>Northern</rs> people are becoming weary of this purposeless slaughter.--About the temper of the business men there can be but little doubt; they have been for many weeks giving to the cause of peace all the influence which their own timidity and the constitution of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> will allow them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>But now we have fair grounds for believing that matters have gone further, and that the great body of the people are slowly coming round to the opinions of their less shortsighted countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>That these will be candid and confess their own madness is not to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>A people never recants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>But they may show their rulers, by signs not to be mistaken, that they will tolerate no more of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s crusade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The question will be soon determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>If this war is to go on, the immense levy ordered by the <rs>President</rs> must be actually made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The <num value="300000">300,000</num> men must be forthcoming if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is to be conquered, or if even <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> is to be held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But they will not be forthcoming. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> We are told in the last dispatches that the volunteering makes slow progress, and that the question of a conscription continues to be discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Our correspondent declares that in <measure n="11days" type="date">eleven days</measure> only <num value="15000">15,000</num> men had come forward, in spite of the enormous bounty, amounting in all to <measure n="150dollars" type="currency">$150</measure>, that was offered to each man by the <rs>Federal</rs> and State Governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Drafting for service, or, in other words, a conscription, was talked about; but we should think it would be only talked about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The scheme of a forcible levy of troops in a republic to subjugate and hold down another republic is <num value="1">one</num> that will hardly be seriously proposed, even by the more fanatical of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s advisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>All now, therefore, depends on the enlistment that is going on under the <rs>President</rs>'s proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>If this falls, then all is over, and after a few months the independence of the <rs>South</rs> must be acknowledged, as it might have been with profit a <num value="12">twelve</num> month ago. </p> </q><bibl n="London Times,"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> Congress will meet on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It will have many important measures to discuss and to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Let us hope that discussion will be limited and <sic>decison</sic> quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>This is no time for talking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The crisis demands, if ever crisis did demand, the brief, but possible consultation and the most decided action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most important measure to be decided is connected with the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>That law is manifestly imperfect, and demands immediate revision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have already called for an addition of <num value="600000">600,000</num> men to the forces they already have in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The order for resorting to a draft went into operation on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>There can be no doubt that the men will be forthcoming at very short notice, and that unless Congress act at once, and with the utmost energy, we shall be taken at a disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We trust in Heaven that the experience of last year may not be thrown away upon that body, and that it will take such measures as to render the recurrence of such disasters as we then experienced an impossibility for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>To do so they must put into the field a force as large as that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>That this can be done, by calling out all the conscripts between the ages of <num value="35">35</num> and <num value="45">45</num>, and by extending the list to <num value="16">sixteen</num> on the <num value="1">one</num> hand and <num value="55">fifty-five</num> on the other, and that, too, without any very great inconvenience to the agricultural interest of the country, we think it quite evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Youths from <num value="16">sixteen</num> to <num value="18">eighteen</num> are, in general, fully as able to carry a musket as they ever become afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>If there should be especial cases where such ability does not exist, there should be special exemptions to suit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The general law would not be affected by such exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>For the rest, a man <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> old is, in general, as strong, though not perhaps as active, as a man at any other age whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Although he may not be able to double-quick it with younger men, yet there are many duties which he can perform just as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Battalions of men of that age might be placed in all the garrisons, thereby releasing younger men for field duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They can serve heavy guns, and even <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, as well as younger men. But, above all, there is no reason on earth why they should not serve as drivers and as cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We are sure the <rs>Government</rs> could find employment for <num value="100000">100,000</num> such men, without making them serve as infantry, where the youngest and most active alone should be employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>And they would leave thereby <num value="100000">100,000</num> young men to serve in the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>We think, too, that old men might be employed in the public offices entirely with great advantage to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It would give whole battalions of young men an opportunity, which no doubt they eagerly desire, to serve their country in the field.
