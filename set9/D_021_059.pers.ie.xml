<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> We think it very probable that <num value="1">one</num> of the immediate consequences of this war will be an emancipation pressure upon the border slave States, which will rapidly operate to the abolition of slavery therein; and by the action of these States themselves, in view of the changed condition of things around them, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, with the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, will, we think, find it to their advantage to slough off this <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> as quickly as possible, consistent with the public tranquility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>We think, too, that such will be the course of said States, with the issue in their hands, and the question should be left to them, and to every other slave State of the present day, as it was left originally to the slave States of New York, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> It is this policy which has broken down the stronghold of the rebellion in the <rs>West</rs>, and which, if not disturbed, will speedily break up the whole concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> The Tax bill introduced in the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> by <persName n="Stevens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Stevens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, proposes to place several heavy taxes upon newspapers, and the consequence is quite a commotion among the individuals who control the New York press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> claims that it would have to pay from <num value="30000">thirty</num> to <measure n="40000dollars" type="currency">forty thousand dollars</measure> a year in the form of taxes for the support of the <rs>Government</rs>, but facetiously remarks that this large sum would be cheerfully paid, and hopes that the bill may soon become a law. The following is a pleasing picture of the harmony existing in the <q>&#x0022;happy family&#x0022;</q> of New York journalists: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> states that its annual taxes will amount to about <measure n="25000dollars" type="currency">twenty- five thousand dollars</measure>, and the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italics">World</hi> will have to pay proportionate sums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>As the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> confesses that it is now losing money everyday of its publication, it will of course be unable to contribute its <measure n="25000dollars" type="currency">twenty-five thousand dollars</measure>, and the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italics">World </hi> are both in the same peculiarly perplexing pecuniary predicament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>For the benefit of this impoverished and ruined trio, therefore, we revive our former suggestion, which they would have done well to regard some time ago, and kindly advise them to make a copartnership of the <unclear><num value="3">three</num></unclear> establishments, and issue only <num value="1">one</num> paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>They must either combine or collapse, and we are anxious that they shall combine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Together their aggregate circulation would become almost respectable, their advertising would occupy several columns, their expenses for editors and reporters, printers and pressmen, would be diminished, and they would make almost harmonious trio, and work together, as usual, for the abolition of everything generally, under the pleasing and appropriate title of the greatest newspaper on earth--<q>&#x0022;the <name>World</name>, the <name>Flesh</name>, and the <name>Devil</name>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> As for the evening papers, the <hi rend="italics">Post</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Commercial </hi> are least able to endure any pecuniary strain, and will have to coalesce upon the <rs>Christian</rs> principle of bearing <num value="1">one</num> another's burthens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName></hi> will die, no doubt, having killed many of its readers lately with <hi rend="italics"><unclear></unclear></hi>. It has been diseased a long time, and its decease will be very natural, not unexpected, and very little regretted.--The <hi rend="italics">Express</hi> will probably be able to pay its little tax of about <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">ten thousand dollars</measure> from the receipts of its <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> editions; and the well known patriotism, liberality and public spirit of its proprietors, leave no doubt that its contribution will be cheerfully paid, and even doubled if the <rs>Government</rs> requires the sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The <name>Sunday</name> papers, however, must either unite or become extinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>On the part of the public we sincerely desire that the <name>Sunday</name> press may decide upon the latter alternative; but, if all the <name>Sunday</name> papers bundle together, we suggest that the result be called the <hi rend="italics">Sunday Sewer,</hi> and wish it all the success it deserves and can obtain as a new rival to <persName n="Barnum,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Barnum,nomatch:0"><surname>Barnum</surname></persName>'s <q>&#x0022;Happy Family.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> By all means, then, let the tax bill pass immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> A correspondent of a Northern paper, writing of the evidences of treason among the ladies of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> I have seen only <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> of women who are loyal, and both of these are among what might be called the <q>&#x0022;lower walks&#x0022;</q> of social life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/><num value="1">One</num> of these was a bare-armed, bare- headed female that issued from a shanty on the bluffs as we passed along the front of the city, and commenced waving her hands wildly up and down, at the same time <hi rend="italics">tattering </hi> violently on her toes, like some devotes before the altar of an <unclear>Aztecoidol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/></unclear> She continued this demonstrative but original welcome, till a couple of other females issued from the same shanty, and forcibly carried her in-doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>It may be suspected that her loyal recognition sprang rather from whiskey than patriotism &mdash; a suspicion that my own mind is not altogether free from, as I have carefully reflected upon this singular and almost isolated case of Union feeling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> The other case was also that of an <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> lady, and seemed more the result of genuine loyalty than of stimulants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>As <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and Staff were riding through the city, a woman rushed out from a house, and throwing up her hands in the style adopted by cruel parents when they say <q>&#x0022;Bless you, my children,&#x0022;</q> in <num value="15">fifteen</num>-cent novels, exclaimed; <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless ye, gintlemen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Arran, git in there, ye thafe, and don't be boderin' the life out o' me!&#x0022;</q> The last remark, I may say, was accompanied by a resounding slap, and was addressed to a dirty-faced gessoon that thrust his unkempt head beyond the doorway &mdash; and not, as may be surmised, to the <name>Illinoisian</name> hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The youth set up <num value="1">one</num> of those vigorous howls so peculiar to offended juvenility, and amid a chorus of slaps, blessings, and the roars of the suffering infant, the <rs>General</rs> turned a corner and disappeared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> A little further, and the party passed slowly by a costly carriage, out of <num value="1">one</num> of whose windows was thrust the head of an elegantly dressed lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>She was giving some directions to the liveried darkey that held the reins, but looking up as the party passed, she caught sight of the <rs>Federal</rs> uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>With a <q>&#x0022;baugh!&#x0022;</q> as if she had swallowed a toad, she spat toward the ground, and with a contemptuous and expressive grimace of disgust upon her features, drew in her head, and threw herself back in her carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Quite possibly such movements are the very height of Southern breeding &mdash; further North, in the land of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and wooden clocks, a woman who would perpetrate an act of this kind, under similar circumstances, would be regarded &mdash; well, to use a convenient everyday expression, as <q>&#x0022;no better than she should be&#x0022;</q>--a somebody closely skin to, if not the identical, scar;et feminine spoken of in Revelations. </p> </q><bibl n="A correspondent of a Northern paper"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> We have scarcely recovered from the astonishment with which the whole town was thunderstruck at the astounding news on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The annals of naval warfare contain no parallel to this extraordinary achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It stand alone, unprecedented, and at a single blow has revolutionised the whole system of naval warfares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>That a single vessel, and that not of a large size, could be so constructed and so controlled as to demolish <num value="3">three</num> of the largest and most powerful men-of-war in the world, is a prodigy which we can scarcely credit even now. And yet it is so. The Virginia, aided by <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> side wheel steamers and gunboats, has sent to the bottom <num value="3">three</num> war ships, which were the pride of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the wonder of the world. --<placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, where hostile fleets and transports have so long rode in safety and defiance is now a more unsafe place for the strongest Federal ship than the mid ocean in a tornado.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The <q>&#x0022;perfect failure,&#x0022;</q> as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> pronounced the <rs>Virginia</rs>, has proved the much brilliant success of naval architecture and her heroic commander, his officers and man, as well as their comrades of the other vessels, have covered themselves with glory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> Ever since <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct>, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have been constructing a floating <orgName n="Iron Battery" type="battery">iron battery</orgName>, called the <orgName n="Stevens Battery" type="battery">Stevens battery</orgName>, at <placeName reg="Hoboken, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013711">Hoboken</placeName>, opposite New York, every few years making large appropriations for it, until the aggregate amounted to a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Its operations were subducted with the most profound secrecy, not even naval officers being permitted to examine it. And yet, within the last <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> a committee appointed by the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> have decided against it. The Merrimas (now the <rs>Virginia</rs>) was prepared for her purposes less than a year ago, and constructed amidst difficulties and embarrassments which few can conceive of. Yet those engaged in her persevered with a determination only equalled by the vast energy with which she was fought, and she has already done her work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>She has proved as remarkable a triumph of Southern mechanical skill as of Southern valor, and has inaugurated a system of coast defence which, if vigorously pursued, can do more to break the blockade and rid our coast of a fiendish foe than the combined navies of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>And so he goes on, treading on <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s toes, bruising his shins, and tripping him up, and, as long as he makes an apology for it afterwards, <persName n="Bull,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="nearbymention:Bull,John,,,"><surname>Bull</surname></persName> considers himself bound to be pacified, and to rejoice at the restoration of their friendly relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The seizure of British <term type="ship">ships</term>, the <rs type="ship">Trent</rs> affair, the stone blockade, the imprisonment of <name>British</name> citizens, are all so many demonstrations of a desire to annoy and exasperate him, and the explanations which follow a demand, for redress are, in reality, covert insults to his understanding and good nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>By this time it is evident to all the world, except honest <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, that he is be coming the victim and the butt of the malisons <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, who is determined to insult him <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and apologize afterwards at every opportunity that offers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We are sorry to see the old gentleman made ridiculous; but as long as he chooses to doft the lion's character, and occupy the relation to the belligerents of the donkey between <num value="2">two</num> bundles of hay, he must expect to be laughed at. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> The abandonment of the posts on <placeName reg="Saint Simons Island, Saint Simons Island, Glynn" key="tgn,2024152">St. Simons</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jekyl's island">Jekyl's Islands</placeName>, which I announced <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago, has led to their occupation by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> a few days back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>It was a timely removal, as it would have been idle to jeopardize the safety of a valuable command in defence of a totally indefensible and useless battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The order came sometime before, leaving it discretionary with <persName n="Mercer,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00375" reg="mostcommon:Mercer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Mercer</surname></persName>, commanding in that neighborhood, to carry it out whenever it seemed proper to his judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> gain little by their new acquisitions, since the batteries have been dismantled and the plantations on the islands had been for months deserted; it is not improbable, however, that our bragging foes will represent the capture as very important, and the cotton scoured as immense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> While occupying these post, which are opposite to <num value="1">one</num> another and completely commands the entrance, the worthy commandants engaged in a dispute on regard to the relative strength of their batteries, and <orgName type="company" n="Battery I">I</orgName> am credibly informed an artillery duel ensued between them, <num value="1">one</num> officer retiring from the dispute and opening fire upon his <unclear></unclear> learn that the battery commanded by a Colonel whose name is familiar throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, returned the fire and soon compelled his antagonist to hoist the whits flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Most fortunately no man was injured, though the epaulment of <num value="1">one</num> battery was considerably damaged. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The guns now ready to bear upon any fleet that may come up against <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> are sufficient to cope with the force that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/> I learn by a letter, that in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> it is believed that <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> will fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>You are aware of my opinion, such as it is worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>I do not think it can be taken at present by the <name>Lincolnites</name>, unless some very fortuitous chance should intervene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>As long as we have an enemy intently watching our movements and ready to avail himself of any moment of weakness or relaxed vigilance, we are not altogether safe; but with our means well disposed as they are, we have no great cause of alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Should the enemy make the trial, be assured it will be a hard-fought fight and a desperate struggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> In my last letter I mentioned what was here regarded as the probable means by which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> hoped to be able to reduce <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> and open the way to the city of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> and the possession of the <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of bales of cotton which the <rs>Herald</rs> has promised to the starving work, people of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, in reward for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> of patient endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Wonderful magnanimity of the squint-eyed oracle of New York vagabonds, to promise the property of foes not yet in the ranch of Federal arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>In that letter I described the island on which the <rs>Federals</rs> would dexter act a battery as <placeName reg="Alvarado Island">Alvarado Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>I was misinformed of the name, through the misapprehension of my informant.--It should have been <placeName reg="Elba Island, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2312991">Elba Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The facts remain as I there described them, although I must add that the opinion is general that they have already commenced work on that position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> Next month is a warm month in this latitude, and, if the winter does not <q>&#x0022;linger too long in the lap of spring,&#x0022;</q> an exceedingly uncomfortable <num value="1">one</num> for the occupants of our islands and marshes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The impression prevails that they will not be able to hold their present positions during our summer, but I think it is an error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Had we a foe to deal with who regarded the life of his merfas of any consequence, it might be otherwise but the reckless disregard which has characterized the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, compel me to think they will permit the decimation of their force by all the diseases incident to our low coast and warm climate before abandoning the islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>They have spent much money and incalculable labor in improving the harbor of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, and the port of <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName>; for it merits the name of a port, if we take into consideration the number of ships constantly under its protection, and the many improvements which energetic <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have improvised: such as railways, quays, and causeways, across the extensive marshes between the island and the main land, or, rather, other islands, closer to the main.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The railroad must have proven of great <unclear></unclear> to them, as it enabled a rapid movement to be made from <num value="1">one</num> end of the island to the other, from which <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Pulaski</placeName> can plainly be discerned, and the embarkation for a very short voyage to the coast of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> below, at any point they might design to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>It is not to be supposed that all this would have been projected for the purpose of being abandoned when the climate and position and other contingent disadvantages could have been most readily calculated before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>No, they may suffer, they may die of disease, but new sacrifices will be kept constantly on the altar of the fell destroyer which seeks its victims among the strangers who may come within his domain; it may cripple his resources so much as to prevent any active measure against us; it may allow us the coveted chance to strike a blow at them, but no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>I trust that much good may result from our approaching summer to us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last <num value="21">twenty-one</num> sail of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ships were laying off <placeName reg="Warsaw, Benton, Missouri" key="tgn,2060834">Warsaw</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>During the night the remaining <num value="16">sixteen</num> quietly slipped their cables and were off to no <num value="1">one</num> knows where nor can conjecture be of any avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>It is not very probable that they have gone for, and they may yet turn up in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Brunswick, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2022283">Brunswick</placeName> and the <name>Jalands</name> of <placeName reg="Saint Simons, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2637746">St. Simons</placeName> and <persName n="Jekyl,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="mostcommon:Jekyl,nomatch:0"><surname>Jekyl</surname></persName>, which were abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>The necessity of guarding their movements against rebel curiosity leads me to think that it is some such expedition against our coast, not very to ridable, nor designed as any other than a foray to harass us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> This day the assembling of the militia of the city of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chatham, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000316">Chatham county</placeName> took place, in accordance with the proclamation of <persName n="Brown,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="nearbymention:Brown,R.,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, and about <num value="2000">two thousand</num> men appeared on the parade around, and were called upon to volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The turn-out was very general-indeed, I saw among the number many <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, who could not be subjected to the draft, and conspicuous among them the <rs>British</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Vice-Consul">Vice-Consul</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The trepidation which precedes a dreaded day probably never was more general than on this occasion, and all who were liable presented themselves, fearing the threat which the <rs>Governor</rs> held out of a draft of all absentees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>On the parade ground, out of the large number, when those exempted were ordered to step in advance, I cannot exaggerate when I say <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> came forward; all had excuses to plead &mdash; some by reason of disease, others of physical inability, furloughs, commissions, and other causes, were exempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>From the remainder, when the volunteers were called for, <num value="6">one-half dozen</num> stepped forward, and with a company already volunteered and received made <num value="66">sixty-six</num> men out of the quota of <num value="215">two hundred and fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The remainder will be drafted, if the number is not made up by volunteers in the meantime </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/> During the day all the employees of Government ceased their work, however necessary it might have been, and when all the resources of the mechanics are taxed to the utmost. </p>
