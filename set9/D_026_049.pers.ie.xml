<head>The currency and Tax laws.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> Nothing can be more happily adapted to the condition of the country than these judicious and <hi rend="italics">searching</hi> measures of the recent Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>They not only promise to set the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> upon a firm and solid financial basis, but they achieve a national desideratum of a yet more important nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Theoretically and politically, under our system, the people are the <rs>Government</rs>, and the <rs>Government</rs> is the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>But in the absence of taxation, and while the <rs>Government</rs> was flooding the country with its paper credits to meet its enormous expenses, there was no financial ligament apparent or felt maintaining this mutual relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The people were detached from the <rs>Government</rs> financially, and every occasion of the payment of depreciated Confederate money for anything was a fitting <num value="1">one</num> for jibes and jests at the expense of that currency, and often in ridicule of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>This kind of pleasantry to some, of pain to the great body of the people, will soon be at an end. The people will be bound to their own Government by the important financial link which is indispensable to a proper appreciation of their responsibility for the <rs>Government</rs> of their own creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>They will become the creditors of the <rs>Government</rs> in the most direct form, and they will take upon themselves the burthens of supporting it at a time of all others when their support is needed, and when it would be the deepest degradation and damnation to withhold it &mdash; at a time when the enemy is at the door threatening the land with abasement, servitude, and nationalization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> This glorious result is obtained by these measures, which the country hails with joy. The Government will now be sustained.--Every man will be working for it &mdash; every man will serve it either in the field or in his occupation at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>They will serve it because it is their Government, and because it is now struggling in a war for their deliverance from a hated and oppressive connection with the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and to secure that national independence which the people themselves have determined to enjoy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> The energy of the administration of the <rs>Government</rs> will be inconceivably increased by these measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Its improved credit, as well as its actual means, will give it a lever by which it will achieve greater results than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The dignity of its position has been promoted, its respect among the people elevated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The jibe and the jest at its fallen credit will be changed into public approbation of its solvency and financial ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Each man will be gratified that he is a creditor and a constituent of such a Government &mdash; and even the remorseless Speculator, when called on for <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of his profits, will feel exalted as a partner in business with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Could there be a more valuable and acceptable partner than <num value="1">one</num>, who, while withdrawing a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the profits of the concern, makes the remaining <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> worth more than the whole was?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Certainly not. Speculators are smart enough to see this, and all their grumbling, if they grumble at all, will be mere affectation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> Politically and financially, the measures are most admirable in their effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Morally and socially, they will be equally so. They will reduce to rational degrees inflated profits from an inflated currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>They will administer to Avarice and Cupidity a whole-some check, and improve the morality of men who had given themselves, soul and body, to selfishness and money seeking.--These will be taught the lesson that they owe Fealty to their country &mdash; a lesson next in dignity to that which teaches them what they owe to their <hi rend="smallcaps"><name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</hi> </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Hoarding.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> Men will be hoarding something in times of peculiar uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/><num value="1">One</num> time gold, another time salt, another time flour, another time meat, another time sugar, etc., etc.; and now they are after the favored securities and the <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> notes and their fractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>They must be ever speculating, and thereby ultimately making things worse for everybody, and of course for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Yet it is a passion so natural that it is idle to rail at it. We may denounce it as we choose, yet it spreads like an epidemic, until the nation becomes involved, and the difficulty is to find those who do not deserve censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>So it was with <hi rend="italics">extortion</hi> and <hi rend="italics">speculation</hi> at the beginning of the war. A holder of a cargo of salt initiated the era of speculation by demanding <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per sack, that had cost possibly, all told, <measure n="1.75dollars" type="currency">$1.75</measure>. This advance was considered so enormous, and &#x0022;such an unjustifiable speculation in the necessaries of life,&#x0022; that it was made the subject of grave complaint to no less a body than the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, by a body of <hi rend="italics">Farmers,</hi> who have, sooth to say, since proved that they are as great extortioners as any in Jewry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Yet salt ran up in a few months to such prices that <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per sack was nothing in comparison to it. At <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per sack we could now manure our fields with salt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> Everything has been speculated in, and everybody that has had anything to sell has yielded, willingly or not, to the circumstances surrounding them and accepted exorbitant prices!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>A turning point in trade and finance is about to be reached, and the boarding takes a turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Men are hoarding the <hi rend="italics">currency,</hi> strange to say &mdash; and even checks upon the <name>Banks</name> are deposited in secret drawers and strong boxes, to be held up till after <date value="04-01">1st April,</date> in order to get in payment of them a better currency than that now disbursed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>But the <name>Banks</name> have made a move that checkmates these smart hoarders completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>They have given notice that hey will decline paying any undrawn dividends, certificates of deposit, and checks, of any date prior to the <date value="05-28">28th March,</date> in anything save the currency now existing, and a now rated and valued ! So that winds up the speculation in checks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> The Confederate small notes, however, will continue to be hoarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> notes because they are receivable at par and fundable in Government <num value="4">4</num> per cents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>till <date value="07-01">1st of July;</date> and the notes of smaller denomination because they are not proscribed at all, and will be at par with the better currency until otherwise ordered by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Indeed as they are essential for change, and as the <rs>Government</rs> derives an immense profit from their destruction, it is probable they will not be called in during the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> But what avails the hoarding?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>It is an evil to the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>If small notes are hidden away by avaricious dealers, trade must be obstructed as much to the injury of the <hi rend="italics">seller</hi> as the <hi rend="italics">buyer;</hi> and if the evil becomes very great, some expedient will arise for the remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>With reference to the <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollar</measure> notes their fate must be the same as that of the larger ones, it is only delayed <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>; and the probability is that by their free circulation, together with the smaller notes, retailers would make a great deal more than they can by hoarding them <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> to escape temporarily the full effects of the currency bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>What if the fractional notes be hoarded even unto the end of the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Is any man sure they will be receivable for taxes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>that these notes will have an immunity from the fate of larger ones?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>that the <rs>Government</rs> will not conceive it a duty to itself and the people to estimate them when redeemed at the depreciated value at which they will have so long floated through the channels of trade? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> The hoarders in these notes will be obliged to meet the fate of hoarders in general, and that is finally to have profited nothing by their hoarding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>There is an invisible power that cuts them down to the average, and few men who have flourished with <num value="1000000">millions</num> will, after this drama is concluded, be able to boast of more than an ordinary profit upon their labor and ventures, while hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> will be hopelessly wrecked, never to recover their fortunes. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>Small notes.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> As persons are hoarding <num value="1">one</num> and <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollar</measure> notes, partly with the view of paying them over to the <rs>Government</rs> in taxes after <date value="04-01">1st April</date> and partly to diminish the amount they will have to convert into Government bonds, it would be a public benefit to deprive them if possible of some of the advantages to be derived from a policy which occasions much inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>As these notes were issued for change in small dealings, in lieu of specie which had disappeared, has not the <rs>Government</rs> the authority to restrict their receipt in payments to itself to such amounts as are necessary to pay fractional sums?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>It might be done as a necessary measure to facilitate business &mdash; to enable its collecting officers to discharge their duties with as little delay as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If they have to count a large number of small notes it will seriously retard their transactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>An order of this kind would be of some service. </p> </div3>
