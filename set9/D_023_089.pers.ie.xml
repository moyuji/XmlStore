<head>The situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> We endeavored yesterday to show that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have nothing to hope for in this war but what they could obtain by their own valor and their own perseverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>This fact has been demonstrated so clearly since the commencement of the war that we had, until very lately, thought It was admitted by everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Within the last few weeks, however, we perceive a growing disposition to rely upon other sources of relief, such as the disordered state of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> finances, the menacing attitude of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, and the violent discontent of a large portion of Northern society with the <name>Emancipation</name> proclamation of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We very well remembered how nearly fatal to our cause had been the illusions of the last year, and how sternly we had been reminded by events that the only just dependence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was in the arms and hearts of her sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>We would respect the lesson we then endeavored to teach every day in the year, if we could thereby the more deeply impress it upon the minds of our countrymen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> We have nothing to depend on but our own prowess and our own firmness, yet are not these enough?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>See what they have already done for us. As long as we depended upon foreign intervention, we lay supine and did nothing for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The enemy employed the interval, which we were wasting in idle dreams of approaching peace, in making the most gigantic preparations for subduing us and reducing us to a state of absolute vassalage, if not downright slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>We awoke from our dream to find ourselves already half undone; but we woke us a giant wakes from a short slumber, and we mapped the bonds which the foe had attempted to rivet upon us while we slept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It is because we fear the same lethargy may again creep over our senses, that we lift a voice of warning to our countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Affairs are not so gloomy now as they were last Spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We have abundantly shown our ability to beat the enemy in the field, and have demonstrated to the world that we cannot be subdued as long as we are true to ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> What is there in our situation that ought to discourage men engaged in a struggle for their liberties?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>After a series of victories unequalled in this country, not surpassed in any other, we have met with <num value="2">two</num> reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>They appear to be by no means decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Our armies are not destroyed &mdash; Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are not captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Our material is but little impaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The spirit of our troops is not broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>What also can we expect than to meet with occasional bad fortune in a war waged with such determination?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It is not in the nature of things that it should be otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The victories of <num value="1">one</num> part of the country must be sometimes counterbalanced by the reverses in another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>It is only upon casting up the accounts and striking a balance, that we can fairly estimate the importance of our lessees and our gains.
