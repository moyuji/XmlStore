<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> It is related by a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> scribe, that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, being inquired of whether some Confederate clergyman might be permitted to pray for <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, replied: &#x0022;Oh, yes; <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and the <name>Devil</name> both need praying for.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We have nothing to say of the wit of the observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s profession is that of arms, and he is not expected to be equally bright with the tongue and the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>But he ought to be at least grateful to his benefactors and respectful to his superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>When has the <name>Devil</name> ever injured or forsaken <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, that he should mention him in the same connection with <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Such unfilial and irreverent treatment from the Old Gentleman's pet may well wring from his agonized bosom the exclamation: &#x0022; How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Possibly, however, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> meant no discourtesy to his official superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It may be that he does not believe in a Devil, any more than a <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, about which he is said to have expressed himself at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> in blasphemous contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> race has become, of late, equally incredulous of Heaven and Hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The appearance of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> supplies a void place in their theology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The Pantheistic ideas which they have adopted discover in Nature, in all her forms, a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; but there was still wanting a Devil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> came and supplied the vacuum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> man says &#x0022;Go to the <name>Devil</name>,&#x0022; he only means, Go to <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The Confederate <rs type="role2">President</rs> looms up like the <rs>Prince</rs> of Pandemonium in all <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He is the immortal Adversary of Peace, Order and Liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Although the <name>Devil</name> is said by <persName n="Johnson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> to have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>, <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> has thrown his illustrious predecessor completely into the shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Satan only introduced rebellion into the court of Heaven, but <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> raised its foul standard amongst the higher intelligence and purer saints of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He was the diabolical author of Secession and Disunion, and invented them both, because he would rather rule in Hell than serve in Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But for him the victims of his infernal arts would even now return to their allegiance to the celestial hierarchies at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There are not wanting those in our own borders who have discovered that he is the author of all our woes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Having lead us into mischief, he is striving to make us as unhappy as possible, intending, finally, to get out of the scrape himself, and leave the rest of us in the lurch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He is the author of short crops and bad weather; he raises the prices of bread and meat; makes breaches in the canals and railroads; interferes with the management of our armies, and causes general defeat and disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is well understood that, if the <name>Revolution</name> should come to naught, he would suffer none of the pains and penalties of rebellion, but, on the contrary, would have a place offered him in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Cabinet, with the probability of becoming his successor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Having no personal interest in the success <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> of the cause, he naturally feels himself at liberty to make as many blunders as possible, assume the military control, put incompetent generals in positions of vital importance, and sacrifice <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> to death and captivity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> We differ from <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in <num value="1">one</num> thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We never heard before that it did any good to pray for the <name>Devil</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Certainly, such a Devil as <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> is past all possibility of salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We would much better pray for such saints in the flesh as <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, Turchen, <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,H.,H.,,:1"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, etc., who, though the salt of the earth, have their little imperfections, and are not quite angels; at least, we see, as yet, &#x0022;no signs of wings sprouting from <hi rend="italics">their</hi> shoulder-blades.&#x0022; There are a few cracks in their armor of steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Let us pray that the <name>Devil</name> may find no vulnerable place to reach their innocent hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><hi rend="italics">They</hi> have had nothing to do with the bloodshed and misery that have swept over the <rs>South</rs> like a volcanic eruption from Hell.
