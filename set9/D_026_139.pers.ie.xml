<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It was subsequently ascertained that these movements were but <unclear></unclear> into to deceive our forces, while the real movement for the surprise and capture of the city was on the <placeName reg="Jerusalem Plank">Jerusalem Plank</placeName> road, coming into <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> from a southerly direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>On the <num value="2">two</num> first named roads the enemy appeared in considerable number as early as <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, and brisk skirmishing was kept up for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>At <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> the <rs type="place">Court house</rs> and engine bells were rung, to which the citizens responded with their usual alacrity, and manifested every disposition to defend their homes and firesides. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>A short time afterwards a regiment came around <placeName reg="Rives's house">Rives's house</placeName> on our left, another appeared on our right, and a large body came down in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We had but <num value="170">one hundred and seventy</num> men all told, and it was impossible with this number to guard centre, right, and left, along, a length of <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile of more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The order was given to retreat, and in a few minutes the enemy had possession of our works, our came, and were in full pursuit of our men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The enemy came on in double column, with sabres drawn, until they reached the hill opposite the <orgName n="Water Works" type="works">water works</orgName>, where they planted a cannon for the purpose of shelling the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>These he burned, and after burning a small bridge across a <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> this side of <placeName reg="Calhoun, Gordon, Georgia" key="tgn,2022321">Calhoun</placeName>, proceeded in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2024046" n="1.000 167" reg="resaca, gordon, georgia">Resaca</placeName>, at which place it was supposed he would burn the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He has also captured many prisoners, and is tearing up the track of the railroad on his march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>You will recollect that in <num value="1">one</num> of my previous letters I stated that <persName n="Chalmers,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Chalmers,nomatch:0"><surname>Chalmers</surname></persName> was on the march for the enemy's rear. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> Another Important item of news reached me this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/><num value="1">One</num> of our scouts arrived in our lines this evening, and reports that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, last he witnessed the burning of the bridge at <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013453">Bridgeport</placeName> A. strong force of the enemy being on this side of the river he could not ascertain what troops burned it, it is very likely to be those of <persName n="Vaughn,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Vaughn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>This statement is very likely to be correct, for the scouts attached to this army are an intelligent and reliable body of men, and nearly all the information received at army headquarters is through them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> In addition to these, it is stated that <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, with <num value="11000">11,000</num> cavalry, is marching rapidly in the direction of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, where it is supposed he will combine with the <num value="2">two</num> other columns and endeavor to capture the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>This latter news I cannot vouch for, but it is more than likely; for a grand movement of cavalry in the rear of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army is looked for. Whether <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Blair,nomatch:0"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smith,,A.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="default:Smith,A.,J.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> will be able to compel the <num value="3">three</num> columns to retire is a question of much anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But it is believed that if our cavalry is well <num value="100">hundred</num> they cannot do so. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> I regret exceedingly that my letters do not reach you regularly every day, for each morning I send <num value="1">one</num> to <placeName reg="Marietta, Cobb, Georgia" key="tgn,7014000">Marietta</placeName> by courier to give it to a gentleman going to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> everyday, he having kindly promised to hand you the same immediately on his arrival.
