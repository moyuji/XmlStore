<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We have often observed that this contest is a revival of the old war between the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> and Cavalier, and the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> are themselves recognizing formally the existence of a fact which has long been evident to all who can observe and reflect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We have never supposed that the existence of slavery is the cause of the long and irritating strife which has resulted at last in an appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Slavery is the occasion, but only the occasion of that strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It is truly a head of gold and feet of clay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It is a curious fact, but <num value="1">one</num> which we venture to assert can be demonstrated by genealogical record, that those families and sections of the <rs>North</rs> which were not of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> origin, have been uniformly found in opposition not only to abolitionism, but to all those other <hi rend="italics">isms</hi> which are the rank growth of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> religion and morals, and that, when blown were to be given or taken, the best fighting men of the <rs>North</rs> have been found in that small, but honorable minority which has not bowed the knee to the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> <persName n="Beal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Beal,nomatch:0"><surname>Beal</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> We have no feelings but of profound respect and reverence for true religion; nor would we deny for a moment the superintending <rs>Providence</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in war as well as in peace, as indicated in the passages of Holy Writ grouped together in <hi rend="smallcaps">Cromivell's</hi> Bible, and which afford another striking proof that <q>&#x0022;the <name>Devil</name> can quote Scripture for his purpose.&#x0022;</q> If they could afford aid and comfort to rebels against <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>,</hi> why not to rebels against <hi rend="smallcaps">Lincolny</hi> The <rs>Providence</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has been manifest in this war, but not on the <name>Roundhead</name> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Nor can it be forgotten that all their famous texts proved at last devoid of application to their cause, for the usurper's success was a short-lived affair, and in the restoration of the throne, the <name>Cavaliers</name>, if given to mouthing scripture, might have reminded the <name>Roundheads</name> of certain texts more significant and applicable than any of their own, such as <q>&#x0022;My son, fear thou the <rs>Lord</rs> and the <rs>King</rs>; and meddle not with them that are given to change.&#x0022;</q> Quotations of a similar character might be indefinitely multiplied from both the <rs>Old</rs> and New Testaments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>So <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName></hi> stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Saul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Saul,nomatch:0"><surname>Saul</surname></persName>.</hi> &#x0022;</q> To which it may be added, that after wards when a man came to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>,</hi> boasting that he had killed <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Saul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Saul,nomatch:0"><surname>Saul</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Saul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Saul,nomatch:0"><surname>Saul</surname></persName>'s</hi> own command, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName></hi> ordered <num value="1">one</num> of his soldiers to put him to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>So that the <orgName n="American Tract Society" type="society">American Tract Society</orgName> will perceive that the <name>Cavaliers</name> might have got up a Bible as well as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>,</hi> and that the result would have illustrated the appropriateness of their quotations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>But what beautiful consistency in men, the chief glory of whose ancestors is that they were rebels, to exult in being the tools of a village despot, and converting the same fanaticism which once made war upon <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName> into an engine for the overthrow of freedom!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But the whole history of the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> proves that it was not the love of liberty, but the love of power, that enlisted them on the side of rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>They were as discontented in <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>, where they had equal rights, as in Britain, where they professed to have none, and more bloody, intolerant and despotic in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> than the most arbitrary Government of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> When the vine Founder of Christianity was asked what a man must do to be saved, He pointed out certain things to be believed and certain things to be done, as absolutely essential to that great end. Nothing can be more sublime and beautiful than true religion, as defined by its Divine author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is a daily sacrifice of faith and obedience, and inward crucifixion of evil appetites and passion, whilst all outward ostentation and parade of plenty are to be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He never rebuked the <name>Publicans</name> and Harlots more indignantly than he did the <name>Pharisees</name>, who were the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> of His time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He was Himself blasphemously denounced by the <name>Pharisees</name> as a glatton and wine bibber, because He set an example in His own person of temperate enjoyment of all innocent pleasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>He was as explicit in His prohibition of hypocrisy as of vice; of making prayers at the street corners as of no prayers at all, of giving alms to be seen of men, as of giving no alms whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>When thou prayest, go into thy closet, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.--When thou fastest, anoint thine head and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>When thou givest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.--Such was the religion of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName></hi> as understood by the whole <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName>, till Pharisaism rose from its whited sepulchre and once more appeared upon the earth under the form of <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The merciful genius and spirit of Christianity had no place whatever in the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It was Judaism revived; it was the law and the prophets; but the law without its holiness, and the prophets with no inspiration but that which came from hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>It was a religion of long faces; of pious words; of fasting and alias proclaimed everywhere, of sanctimonious externals, of self-denial of all innocent amusements, but, inwardly, such hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness; such envy, Inst and covetousness, that might well have drawn down upon its disciples the terrible denunciation that was addressed to their pro- <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> to types in <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>: <q>&#x0022;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell ?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> It is true, that the descendants of the <name>Cavaliers</name> in the <rs>Southern States</rs> are now the most enlightened and ardent of all constitutional <rs n="Republican" type="political">republicans</rs>, and, represented in all religious denominations, have no more attachment to Church and State than their <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>But in <num value="1">one</num> essential particular they remain unchanged, and until they have changed in this, <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> will never cease to make war upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>They are still gentlemen, and that to a Roundhead is an unpardonable sin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The Roundhead has more reason than ever to feel that the <name>Cavalier</name> is his superior, and, even if slavery had never existed, that galling fact, eating into his very bones, would have rendered perpetual peace between the <num value="2">two</num> impossible. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The Kentucky Legislature resolved solemnly to maintain the strictest neutrality between the contending sections; and her Governor issued a loud proclamation to the world announcing that as the position of his Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Good order reigns everywhere, and a majority of the families resident here remain unmolested in their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The fences are half destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Scarcely a man is to be seen in the streets, except those in uniforms, and there is an air of desertion about the village that is indescribable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>A few of the true <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> families are now there, who have taken possession of their houses since the <rs>Northern</rs> army was driven back.--They are again cultivating their lands and repairing the damage done by the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Their losses have been heavy, and the personal sufferings and anxiety can hardly be imagined by those who live remote from the scene of conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/> It has been nearly <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, I think, since any member of our regiment has troubled your readers with a line upon any subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>We have been so deeply interested in the events about <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> that we were not at all disposed to call attention from that spot towards which both the citizen and stranger henceforth shall travel, and of which the muses shall sing in the coming centuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>But my object in dropping you a line to-day, is <num value="1">one</num> of utility rather than entertainment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/> Day before yesterday, at <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, our regiment broke up camp near <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, where we had remained so long as to have dispatched with the wash basin for <q>&#x0022;the tray&#x0022;</q> as well as the <q>&#x0022;bread basket,&#x0022;</q> and exchanged uncups for granite <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> coffee cups, and had so much to eat and to spare that rats and mice had become regular occupants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>We had also allowed chickens the liberty of quitting their narrow coops to and wander over the fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The boys in our company, instead of cooking their own bread and doing their own washing, have, in many cases, regular cooks and washers at the negro quarters, and it was really touching just before we took up the line of march, while our company was standing in line before their late quarters, now represented simply by the vacant wooden floors &mdash; it was touching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>I say, to witness the leave-taking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The men were awaiting the roll call and leaning upon their guns, when <num value="6">a half dozen</num> negro women and a very old man approached, and beginning at the head of the company, began to shake hands and call down the blessings upon the heads of <q>&#x0022;my dear <foreign lang="lat">massa.</foreign>&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Good bye, <rs type="role" reg="Aunt">Aunt</rs>, Sally.&#x0022;</q> was uttered by many lips with deep feeling, and when the aged woman, with the strong grasp of youth, said <q>&#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">faresell</hi> massa,</foreign>&#x0022;</q> I felt that natural sadness which these sad words must always excite when we know they issue <hi rend="italics">for the lest time</hi> from an honest heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>They never fail to bring before me pictures of the great future which lies before humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The scene at the <q>&#x0022;breaking up&#x0022;</q> would have been a fine subject for the painter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>The tents were all struck, leaving only the bare floors, strewed with boxes, bottles and jars, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c. In the small area of our camp were <num value="700">700</num> men, every <num value="1">one</num> busy over knapsacks, barrels, wagons half loaded, and braying mules and neighing horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Presently the whole line, followed by <num value="22">22</num> wagons and several ambulances, took up the line of march, and we bid adieu to fields and woods with which we had become so familiar as to speak of them with the affection of home scenes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> After a dusty and fatiguing march of <measure n="13miles" type="distance">thirteen miles</measure>, in a dusty road, we encamped near <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, after dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>The wagons which contained all our baggage, including the knapsacks of the men, had been delayed by the breaking down of several of them, and at <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> we had to come to the discouraging conclusion that we should spend the night upon the ground, now saturated with a heavy rain, which had fallen here a few hours before our arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Building a large fire of brushwood, we lay down around it, upon wet pine branches, without a particle of covering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>If our beds had been soft, we might have slept in spite of the wet; but, unfortunately, they were composed of branches, sticks and limbs of various sizes, so that I felt on awakening, at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>, as if I had been beat severely with a stick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Some of the men have been complaining of cold since, but, fortunately, only a few of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Leaving <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> yesterday, after the wagons got up, (<time value="9am">9 A. M.</time>,) we arrived at this place about <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> and went into camp at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The weeds are growing luxuriously in my tent, and everything is in the greatest confusion; but in a few days we expect to be very comfortable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/> Yesterday when we got here many of our men were very hungry, and a farmer near by only charged <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> apiece for biscuit of ordinary size, and <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> for a corn ash cake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>This is the spirit that pervades many if not most of the people of this action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>The farmer referred to above also refused to give the men straw to put into their tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>Were I in command, I would teach these people a lesson they would not forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>But for the presence of our troops he would never have made his wheat, and now he makes us pay <num value="5">five</num> prices for that which our own hands have preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>At our last camp we paid <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> a gallon for buttermilk, (<measure n="14cents" type="currency">fourteen cents</measure> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> price), and <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure> for sweet milk, <measure n="31cents" type="currency">thirty-one cents</measure> for butter, <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> per dozen for corn in the ear, and <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> per dozen for eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Could <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves have given us a more hospitable reception?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>In New York and Pennsylvanians, were we encamped there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>I am sure we would not have to pay more, Some <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> should to issued upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>The men are getting tired of if. They respect private property, and these are the returns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>I confess there are some exceptions, but I state the <q>&#x0022;prices current, &#x0022;</q> I assure you.
