<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> According to advices received yesterday from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, our loss in the fight of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, in killed, wounded and missing, was about <num value="800">eight hundred</num>, while that of the enemy is estimated at <num value="3500">thirty-five hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>As a matter of course, the latter is partly based upon conjecture, but not entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The large number of prisoners taken, together with the fact that our men had an opportunity of seeing the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> dead left on the field, affords a good basis for forming a fair estimate of the amount of the enemy's loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Thus it will be seen that the extent of our victory is considerably greater than at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reported. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Saturday was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occasion on which the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> ever fought against negro troops; and it is hardly probable that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s darkeys will be over-desirous to run against that army again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They were placed in front in the charge, and our men, enraged by the cry of &#x0022;No quarter,&#x0022; slaughtered them like sheep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Comparatively few were taken prisoners, while hundreds were slain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Negroes, stimulated by whiskey, may possibly fight well so long as they fight successfully, but with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> good whipping, their courage, like that of Bob Acres, oozes out at their finger's ends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> We learned last evening some additional incidents of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is stated that after the charge by <persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Mahone,nomatch:0"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Wright,David,,,"><surname>Wright</surname></persName>'s, and <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Saunders,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Saunders,nomatch:0"><surname>Saunders</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName>, the enemy, finding escape impossible, rushed for safety into the immense hole made by their explosion, and around the edge of this chasm our men closed and fought hand to hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The contest was a desperate <num value="1">one</num>, and <persName n="Saunders,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Saunders,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName>'s men, after removing a large number of wounded, buried in this hole on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> <num value="55">fifty-five</num> negro troops and <num value="178">one hundred and seventy-eight</num> whites. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Between our breastworks and the enemy's on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> large numbers of dead and wounded were still lying, the latter begging piteously for water and praying for assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Our men could render them no aid, as they were in full range of the enemy's sharpshooters, who had not ceased their firing even under such appalling circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The length of the &#x0022;sap&#x0022; made by the enemy is supposed to have been about <measure n="600feet" type="distance">six hundred feet</measure>; yet the work, with the appliances brought into requisition by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, is not so great as might be supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is done chiefly by boring, and an immense amount of work can be accomplished in a short space of time. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In the brigade are several companies made up of young men of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Among the prisoners are <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>, and every other grade of officer known in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The officers and men, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, were taken to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and confined together, they being considered &#x0022;birds of a feather,&#x0022; and our authorities being incapable of the cruelty of separating such bosom friends in their captivity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The white <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> must succumb to him. If he want anything, it must be given to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The crusading <hi rend="italics">mania,</hi> though it endured nearly <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>, finally gave way to the light of advancing intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Strong opposition always brings a prevailing illusion to a stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Reflection ensues, and the result is almost sure to be for the cause of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The resistance this negro mania has met with has, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, made people open their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>No quarter!&#x0022; To reasonable and reflecting minds, the scene and the circumstances afford abundant cause of the most unutterable disgust for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> character; utterly destitute, as it is, of every sentiment of honor or humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>With the odds of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num> against the <rs>South</rs>--with the world open to them for material of war, while it is shut to us &mdash; with the advantage of filling its ranks <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> by forman enlistments &mdash; and with the advantage of a navy and an immense power of iron- clads, which has thrown into their hands all the navigable water of the <rs>South</rs>--with all these, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have, besides, enlisted the slaves of the <rs>South</rs> to fight against their masters; and they endeavor to fill the hearts of these confiding poor creatures with vindictive rage and thirst for revenge against their people, their masters, who have ever treated them with kindness and humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Now, they do this by the most extravagant falsehoods concerning the conduct of our men, under <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, at <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>In the whole history of this war not <num value="1">one</num> act of unnecessary harshness even can be charged to this peerless commander.--His humanity is overflowing, and his desire to spare the effusion of blood has lost him many advantages which he permitted, for that sentiment, unavailed to pass by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Against such a chieftain and such high-spirited veterans these unprincipled and heartless <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> send forward their black regiments with the savage cry of &#x0022;Remember <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>In order to succeed in this object, it was necessary that his mind should be inflamed and his most vindictive feelings aroused against his own people.
