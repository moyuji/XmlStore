<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The <rs>Canadians</rs> seem to be in great trouble about the passport system which <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> has introduced ostensibly to prevent conspirators, etc., from crossing the line and burning the goodly towns of <placeName reg="Detroit, Wayne, Michigan" key="tgn,7013547">Detroit</placeName>, <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, etc. Their journals gravely assert that <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> is behind the times &mdash; that the passport system has been abandoned even by <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>; and that, while in full operation it never prevented a single conspirator from crossing the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They complain also of the abrogation of the <name>Reciprocity</name> as a great grievance, calculated to fall with heavy force upon <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, and earnestly desire the <rs>British Government</rs> to interfere, and get all things straight, if it be possible to do so by negotiation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canadian</placeName> journals must have a far more indifferent opinion of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s sagacity than we can venture to entertain, if they believe he is not well aware of the inefficiency of the passport system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He knows well enough that it cannot prevent such incursions from <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> as he affects to dread, and that <num value="6">a half dozen</num> passport officers upon a line <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">two thousand miles</measure> long can afford no security against Confederate raiders, were there really any danger of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But there is no danger; and that no man knows so well as <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>His object is palpable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is, in the first place, to annoy the <rs>British Government</rs> as much as possible, and to affront them at every turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He knows that he shall gain great <unclear></unclear> with his own countrymen without incurring any danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He sees clearly enough that he may offer <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> any amount of insult and injury, and that she will carry her resentment no farther than a protest or remonstrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the meantime, his own countrymen will applaud to the very echo everything he does or says offensive to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, for, since the days of the <name>Revolution</name>, in order to insure popularity in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, nothing more has ever been necessary than to abuse <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName>, who is heartily detested there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> In the second place, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is evidently paving the way to the annexation of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He patterns closely after the great <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, when she wishes to annex an adjoining country, always commences by rendering intercourse as difficult and as onerous as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Police stations are sown thicker along the line &mdash; scarcely a mouse can pass without being detected &mdash; trade is interrupted by prohibitory duties &mdash; the people of the coveted country are straitened and harassed by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> petty annoyances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They complain, protest, remonstrate &mdash; all in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The system, as to foreigners, cannot be altered; but as to subjects, the largest license is allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The inhabitants begin to see, and to feel, how much better off their <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> neighbors are, and they desire to belong to the same Government, that they may enjoy the same advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>And thus, in the end, they become <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> subjects, and advance the <name>Czar</name> <num value="1">one</num> step forward in his march to the south of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Such is the fate &mdash; or analogous to it &mdash; that <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is now preparing for <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, towards which the eyes of every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> have been turned for <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> with all the eager longing of their covetous natures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The unsettled times present many favorable opportunities for annoyance:--the fear of &#x0022;rebel raids&#x0022; is an admirable pretext.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, if the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> be a proper exponent of public opinion, is already more than </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> half disposed to give up <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> &mdash; the people of that magnificent colony have never known restraint upon the entire freedom of their motions &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experience is sufficiently annoying &mdash; the abrogation of the <rs>Reciprocity Treaty</rs> seriously interferes with their individual prosperity &mdash; there is no way of securing to themselves the liberty of trading with their numerous and wealthy neighbors but by becoming their fellow-citizens &mdash; and their fellow-citizens they will, sooner or later, become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Of that we may rest assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There is considerable animosity at present existing between the <num value="2">two</num>.--But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are necessary to the <name>Canadians</name>, and mutual interest will soon allay mutual animosity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Such are the hopes of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, we have no doubt, and such his design in the policy which he has thought proper to inaugurate with regard to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.--Whether it will succeed or not, we are not prepared to say. The Reciprocity Treaty, we believe, was the work of Southern men, who had no desire to see <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> added to their other enemies in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is a shrewd stroke of policy in <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> to abolish it, and thus cut off a large source of wealth to a large class of Canadians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <rs>Canadians</rs> have always looked for defence to a British army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It no doubt delights <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> that they have shown already an invincible repugnance to adopting any measures for self- defence; or, at least, that a portion of them have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We have yet to learn what will be thought of all these things in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We did not believe him when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> read that chapter, but the fact has been rendered very plain during the present war. Under such a ministry as the present, at any rate, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is not what she was <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago, when <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="4">IV</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> We have already given extracts from <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> journals on both sides of the very pretty quarrel that the failure at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> has given rise to between the respective friends of these officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Whenever the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> sustain a reverse, they must find a scapegoat, and the question now is whether <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Butler,James,T.,,:1"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> or <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> shall be that animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>After expending unavailingly such an enormous amount of cold iron, it is somewhat provoking to produce such lame and impotent conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>We suggest that the real party to blame is <persName n="Whiting,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Whiting,M.,D.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Whiting</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lamb,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lamb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>, who constructed a defence that proved impregnable to the most powerful fleet that ever assailed a fortress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A correspondent of a <orgName n="New York Journal" type="newspaper">New York journal</orgName>, writing apparently from the fleet, says that a naval officer, &#x0022;whose name is familiar to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> people as a household word,&#x0022; (meaning thereby, we suspect, <persName n="Porter,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>,) pronounces <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Butler,James,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> either &#x0022;a black-hearted traitor or an arrant coward, &#x0022; and that like opinions prevail in the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Let the <rs>Admiral</rs> keep cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He has the reputation of a naval Lion, and it is somewhat annoying to be laid low by a Lamb; but the <rs>Lion</rs> should be magnanimous, and not console himself by cuffing his friends in this savage way for a flogging which they were trying to prevent.
