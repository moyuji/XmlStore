<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> At last we have received some news of the <rs>Burnside</rs> expedition from a Northern source, and find that it exceeds, in its chapters of disasters, the most exaggerated rumors that have been floating through our streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The sum total of it is, that the backbone of the armada is broken, and so much damage has been done it by the long storm that reinforcements become necessary before putting the plan of the expedition into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> has burnt his fingers in this little project; but he is still valiant and calls as loudly for more men as <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName></persName> did for <q>&#x0022;a horse.&#x0022;</q> He has become terribly severe, and will undoubtedly, in a sheer fit of desperation, throw himself upon the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> coast, in the hope of recovering the prestige lost with so many of his ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The very full telegraphic dispatch sent you yesterday give the main portion of the <rs>Northern</rs> news, and I need not recapitulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The most striking points are that <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> expected to find plenty and willing pilots to conduct him through the inlet, and found none; that mention of loss of life has been so studiously avoided, that so many vessels are still missing, not reported lost, and that many of the gun-boats refused to move from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>--whereupon <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> attempts to shift the responsibility of the disaster upon contractors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Those items will furnish material for considerable thought and speculation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Some days ago, when the rumor reached the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, from this city, that the <rs>Louisiana</rs> was lost, it was very generally discredited, and published in their papers as a <q>&#x0022;blamed rebel falsehood,&#x0022;</q> in order to keep up the public credit as long as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Still there were many misgivings, and many fears that all was not right; and some went so far as to hint at disasters which the <rs>Government</rs> (a la <persName n="Ball,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Ball,nomatch:0"><surname>Ball</surname></persName>'s Bluff) was trying to conceal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, however, the startling news burst upon the people, and, of course, was differently received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In New York the excitement was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Stocks fell at once; the <name>Bulls</name> and Bears went to gambling furiously; brokers regarded the information as news of the sinking of a vast amount of money; ship owners saw in it new chances for speculation, and a ready sale for more old hulks; contractors saw new bargains in supplies.--But the mass of the people saw the failure of <num value="1">one</num> of their dearest hopes and immense destruction of public property, and its consequent loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>See how differently the world looks at disaster! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We now have information from both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> arrived at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="2">15th</day></dateStruct>; some of his vessels ran ashore and were lost; others were missing; a few he got inside, where he now is endeavoring to get the remainder over the bar. Several times his fleet has been seriously annoyed by our little gun-boats, although the sea was too high for them to operate with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> of last week <num value="2">two</num> of our steamers went down <placeName reg="Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, North Carolina" key="tgn,1115016">Pamlico sound</placeName> on a reconnoitering expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>At about <time value="11am">11 o'clock, A. M.</time>, as they were nearing <placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName>, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> steamers hove in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Our vessels pushed on, when the number of the enemy soon increased to <num value="21">twenty-one</num>, and all joined in chasing our <num value="2">two</num> gun-boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>After keeping up the chase for several hours, our vessels being faster than theirs, all dropped <unclear></unclear> except <num value="4">four</num>, and at dusk they were still in sight some miles behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Our gun-boats rejoined the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Since, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> gun-boats have been down at different times and met with the same experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It was thought that as soon as the sea became calm there would be a fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> But it is useless for me to speak further of this affair, as the full extracts from Northern papers, which will be sent you, gives the information at greater length than I would be able to do in my short corner of the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I hope, however, to go down to the sound tomorrow, and shall possibly, glean some items of interest for those who choose to follow me in the journey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Another important item is regarding financial affairs in Yankeedom, which grow no better as rapidly as can be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>A vast public debt is accumulating, with no prospect as yet of money to meet it. The probability of a paper currency has caused an increase of price in every quarter, preparatory to its certain depreciation, and thinking men are becoming seriously alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>There is strong opposition to the bill I spoke of in my last, to raise money by direct taxation for a series of years, and it is believed that the bill cannot pass the <rs type="place">House</rs>, owing to the fierce denunciation of it by the <rs>Western</rs> members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If it fails, what, in the name of wonder, can be done next?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>What new expedient can be devised? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Since I last wrote, many letters of encouragement have been sent me by unknown persons, some of them so kindly that I beg leave to notice them, promising not to encumber your columns often with private affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I would inform <q>&#x0022;T. M.&#x0022;</q> that I think it impossible to get the back numbers he requires; inquire at the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><q> &#x0022;Tar Forest Nymphs&#x0022;</q> wish to know if I would object to give them certain information of a personal nature?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>None in the world, my dear <persName n="Oreades,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Oreades,nomatch:0"><surname>Oreades</surname></persName>; but, then, if I tell you here, there is that sly step-dame &mdash; the public &mdash; who will hear every word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>What else can I say except to express gratification at your note?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><q>&#x0022;J.&#x0022;</q> sends me an elegant smoking-cap &mdash; so fine indeed that it makes me quite ashamed of my poor little, dingy pipe, with its wooden bowl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I wish I knew <q>&#x0022;J.'s&#x0022;</q> address, that I might express my thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> An erroneous opinion, respecting the resources and ability of the <rs>South</rs> to attain success in the present contest, is prevalent among many people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Such persons, in opening a discussion of this subject, usually scoff with vehemence at the possibility of the enemy's ever possessing <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and other threatened points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The valor of <num value="1">one</num> Confederate soldier renders him equal to <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> of his enemies, as proven by the many contests in which an immense disparity of numbers in favor of the invader was no obstacle to our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But this course of remark usually reaches an antithesis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>If these assertions should prove erroneous if <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and other important places, should unhappily fall into the power of the <rs>Northern</rs> army, then all is lost, or nearly so, the cause is desperate, and all further efforts in its behalf may be Herculean exhibitions of valor and determination, but must prove unavailing as regards the establishment of our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>To some, such a view of affairs may seem deserving of encouragement as productive of confidence in our cause, and as an incentive to our soldiers to defend to the last, places of such great importance; but it is not the true view, and house the old precept not to seek a good end by improper means, the wisdom of which the experience of mankind has proven, must be of prime authority here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>In the first place, it is not true that our previous experience in this war will justify the supposition that, in all future battles, we can safely allow the enemy to outnumber us by <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> This assertion does no injustice to our soldiers, nor is it impolitic to make it. The history of war proves that long and careful training may make good soldiers out of very indifferent <hi rend="italics">material</hi> and that the effects of individual cowardice may be obviated when men act in large masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Therefore, while the valor, real, and determination of our men will undergo no diminution, the ability of the <rs>Northern</rs> armies to cope with them may be greatly increased by the careful instruction which their officers have been bestowing upon them; and a future <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> may cost us more trouble and be a bloodier battle that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>And in the second place the supposition, entertained by the class to which we have alluded, that the fortunes of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are staked upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, is erroneous, and were it generally received, might be injurious in its effects, should be uncertain chances of war deprive us of any of these places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>In fact the <rs>South</rs> is possessed of no place of <hi rend="italics">vital</hi> importance; no place, whose possession by the enemy would deprive us of the power of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Were the enemy to advance to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; were he to capture <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>; should he succeed in driving us out of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>; and if he were able to execute his plan of effecting a junction of his armies from the west and the seaboard; still we would be unconquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Even if the enemy were to capture <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our men and arms, and almost all our artillery, still our success would be sure. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Making all allowances for mistakes, we are warranted in saying that the <rs>Federal</rs> army consisted of at least <num value="55">fifty-five</num> regiments of volunteers, <num value="8">eight</num> companies of regular infantry, <num value="4">four</num> of marines, <num value="9">nine</num> of regular cavalry, and <num value="12">twelve</num> batteries, <num value="119">one hundred and nineteen</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/> A paper appended, marked <q>&#x0022;L,&#x0022;</q> exhibits, in part, the ordnance and supplies captured, including some <num value="28">28</num> field pieces of the best character of arm, with over <num value="100">100</num> rounds of ammunition for each gun, <num value="37">37</num> caissons, <num value="6">6</num> forges, <num value="4">4</num> battery wagons, <num value="64">64</num> artillery horses, completely equipped, <num value="500000">500,000</num> of small-arms ammunition, <num value="4500">4,500</num> setts rounds of accoutrements, over <num value="500">500</num> muskets, some <num value="9">9</num> regimental and garrison flag, with a large number of pistols, knapsacks, swords, canteens, blankets, a large store of axes and entrenching tools, wagons, ambulances, horses, camp and garrison equipage, hospital stores, and some subsistence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/> Added to these results may rightly be noticed here that by this battle an invading army superbly equipped, within <measure n="20miles" type="distance">20 miles</measure> of their base of operations, has been converted into <num value="1">one</num> virtually besieged, and exclusively occupied for months in the construction of a stupendous series of fortifications for the protection of its own capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/> I beg to call attention to the reports of the several subordinate commanders for reference to the signal parts played by individuals of their respective command Contradictory statements, found in these reports, should not excite surprise when we remember how difficult, if not impossible, it is to reconcile the narrations of bystanders, of participants in even the most inconsiderable affair, much less the shifting thrilling scenes of a battle-field. </p>
