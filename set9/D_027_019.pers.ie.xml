<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Yesterday, like its immediate predecessor, was exceedingly dull and quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>With the exception of a vague report, which we could trace to no authentic source, that a sharp fight took place on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, we heard nothing in the shape of a rumor during the day. Such a period of quiet in the midst of a campaign which began with so much vigor and excitement constitutes an anomaly in the history of warfare; but it may be the calm which precedes the storm, and ere many days elapse the din of deadly conflict may break the monotony which now prevails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This morning ushers in the anniversary of the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It would be a striking coincidence if the day should be signalized by the advance of contending hosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If such an event were to occur, it would result, by a coincidence still more striking, in the complete rout of the enemy. </p>

<head>An inevitable fate.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the favorite bugbears kept by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> press before the people, to stimulate their energies in support of the invasion, is the dread of future internal convulsions and civil wars if this revolution is successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It is an appeal to the fears of the masses, as well as to all the interests involved in law and order, and has no doubt exerted great influence in keeping the whole <rs>North</rs> resolute and persevering at its work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> But there never was a more shallow fallacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>War is the inevitable lot of humanity &mdash; civil as well as foreign war. Both have been the fate of every country of the world, and of democracies more than by other forms of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Probably <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> enjoys more internal stability than any other nation; because <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> possesses the remarkable combination of a despotism controlled by public opinion, which public opinion is sustained by a citizen soldiery, who, in organization and military efficiency, are fully equal to her regular army, and vastly superior to it in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>If the <rs>North</rs> can adopt such a government, it may enjoy its immunities from civil convulsions; but, to do this, it must wade, for this generation, through a sea of blood which we hardly expect such a self-indulgent generation to encounter for the benefit of posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>A wild democracy cannot be converted into a despotism, and the <rs>State Rights</rs> peculiarity of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs> exchanged for a formal consolidation, without scenes of strife and carnage, compared with which the horrors of this contest are mere child's play. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> The Constitution of the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which theoretically was the essence of human wisdom, has proved practically the climax of human absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Never before was there a Constitution which left the citizens in doubt to whom supreme allegiance was due.--This Constitution calls upon its people to serve <num value="2">two</num> masters, the <rs>General Government</rs> and the <name>States</name>, and to serve <num value="2">two</num> masters is as impossible for a nation as an individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>In addition to this seed of civil convulsions, sown in the very heart of the organic law, the democratic institutions of every State contain in themselves the prolific germs of everlasting faction and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The experience of universal history is uniform to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>No Democracy was ever permanent, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as it has fully proved during this war, are no wiser and no better than those who have before tried the same experiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> There are other facts which go to render civil commotions inevitable, whatever the event of the present contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The conservative influence of slavery can no longer pour oil upon the troubled waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The want of all homogeneousness in the population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> renders inevitable future disintegration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>That country is now a heterogeneous compound of all nations and of all races.--None of the vast multitude whom emigration has cast upon its shores have been trained in the school of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>A large proportion of them are Red <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, Agrarians, and Socialists, to whom the only idea of freedom is an equal division of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>To make confusion worse confounded, the political and social equality of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> with the white races has been a received doctrine with the dominant party in the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>If this doctrine is loathed and detested by a powerful minority, it only adds another to the innumerable knots of controversy which the <rs>North</rs> will have to sunder by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>To all these must be added the direct and irreconcilable antagonism of interests between the <rs>Northwestern States</rs> and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> We should like to know in what way the success of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s scheme for the subjugation of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will prevent the internal convulsions and strifes which all these causes must inevitably engender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>To a plain comprehension it is evident that when the <rs>North</rs> introduced the sword to arbitrate this contest, it inaugurated that identical mode of arbitrating all future contests which it seems so much to dread.--They that draw the sword shall perish by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The Lincoln Government has withdrawn its population from the old vantage ground of reason, and mutual conciliation and compromise, which was the only reliable basis of the old Union, and adopted brute violence as the mode of deciding political questions in <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It has familiarized the minds of its people to scenes of blood and carnage, and thus rendered easy a future transition to the wager of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step, always the most decisive in the career of crime, has been taken; the <name>Rubicon</name> of blood has been passed, and henceforth, the barriers of conscience, custom, and the wise and pacific traditions and spirit of our ancestry all broken through, civil wars will be resorted to by contending factions with as little difficulty and reluctance in <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> as in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Military leaders and trained soldiers have been produced by the present strife in numbers more than sufficient for the future collisions of those internal elements of discord and strife with which the <rs>North</rs> abounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It is the war which has done all this; the war which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> produced by discarding the influences of persuasion and compromise; and the <rs>North</rs>, in sustaining <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> him in the adoption of coercion, has only itself to blame for the bitter and bloody fruits which its own policy must bear through ages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> Again we ask, how can the result of that war, even if it should ensure the subjugation of the <rs>Confederate</rs> people, avert the evils which naturally flow from such a mode of harmonizing conflicting interests and passions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Either <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> must retain his immense standing army and make himself <rs type="role2">Emperor</rs>, or, keeping up only that immense force which will be necessary for the preservation of order in the conquered States, permit the <rs>Northern</rs> and Western States once more to possess the prerogatives of free Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>If he adopt the former alternative, he will have a civil war on his hands at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Even if he succeeds for a time, will there not be as ambitious and enterprising aspirants for the purple in <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> as in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>If the latter, he is powerless against civil discord in the <rs>North</rs>; for if he removes his army from the <rs>South</rs> to put it down, the <rs>South</rs> will rise again, and unite its irrepressible energies to the <rs>Northern</rs> elements of revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Nor can the <rs>Federal Exchequer</rs>, after this war, sustain the expense of an army large enough to ensure stability and peace in so vast a country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, therefore, need not expect, by our sacrifice, to avert that inevitable fate which is <num value="1">one</num> of the curses of fallen humanity, and from which they can scarcely claim to be exempt on the score of superior virtue and humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> Their only hope, indeed, is to accept the separation of the old Union as an accomplished fact, to withdraw their invading armies, to moderate their inordinate ambition and vanity, and to consent event to a peaceful division of the <rs>Northwest</rs> and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, rather than seek to compel the adhesion of such incongruous elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Such a gigantic territory as that they seek to control, and such a dissimilar population, cannot be held together by anything but a gigantic despotism, and even that will not ensure permanent order and quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/><num value="3">Three</num> Republics are not too many for the area and numbers of the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The balance of power could be preserved, and internal affairs more harmoniously directed by <num value="3">three</num> than by <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>That result will have to come some day, and it offers the only mitigation of the evils that are in store for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
