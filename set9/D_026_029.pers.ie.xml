<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>If they are suffering from standers or any other contagions disease, as farcy or distemper, they are assigned to a hospital for the particular disorder, which is located at a safe distance from the other stables and lots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> How much better is this than the practice which has prevailed heretofore and which still prevails in many parts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Previous to the establishment of this infirmary, horses worn out or disabled and the service were turned out to perish around the camps, or left, behind on the march; whilst all animals having the glanders, heretofore considered incurable, were taken out and shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The drain thus kept up upon the stock of horses in the country has been enormous and the prevailing <unclear></unclear> seeming to be that the supply was inexhaustible. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> It had been fortunate for the <rs>Confederacy</rs> if the authorities, both civil and military, and sooner appreciated the value of an able bodied man and a good horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> But the authorities have at last taken a step in the right direction.
