<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/><name>Christian</name> charity requires this, even to our enemies; but we do say, away with that morbid charity which would induce us to nourish in our bosoms the wounded serpent, which we know will inflict upon us and ours the death-sting at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Why should there be any difference made between the officers and privates of the captured foe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Let them be treated as prisoners of war &mdash; not according to the usages of war between civilized nations, because our fee is not of that character &mdash; they are savage, cruel and treacherous, beyond any people ever read or heard of. A place in the hospital or tobacco factory, side by side with the poorest and most degraded private, is far too good for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Should you be disposed to think us harsh, pause for a moment, and think of the present condition and future prospects of our highly bred and gentlemanly crew of the <rs>Savannah</rs>; let us never for a moment, when we are so liberally dispensing mercy to the enemy, forget the case of those noble, brave, but truly unfortunate young men. Again, let us remember the treatment received by the crew of the <name>Parkhill</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>What insult, indignity and cruelty have they not had to endure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Should not every man, woman and child of the <rs>South</rs> regard it as their duty to avenge these atrocities at every opportunity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Their future is all shrouded in darkness and uncertainty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Reflect for a moment, if you please, upon these homes rendered hopelessly desolate by the premature end of a Dreux, <persName n="Bartow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Bartow,nomatch:0"><surname>Bartow</surname></persName>, <persName n="Garnett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Garnett,nomatch:0"><surname>Garnett</surname></persName>, <persName n="Bee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Bee,nomatch:0"><surname>Bee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,James,H.,,:1"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>We should look well to it that we keep securely, and under the most rigid discipline, those upon whom we expect to retaliate the base injuries of these men, a part of them new prisoners of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>We must, further, reflect that nothing has ever been gained by leniency to these depraved miscreants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>What return has <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> received for the courteous treatment lavished with a bounteous hand upon the garrison of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Nothing but the blackest ingratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They were utterly helpless, entirely in our power; might have been hand-cuffed, chained, and driven through the streets a spectacle for all to behold; might have been retained until the present day as prisoners of war in our city jail, faring as do the basest criminals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>You have heard of the very different course adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>What has <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> gained by her generous course to old <persName n="Harney,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Harney,nomatch:0"><surname>Harney</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The cases on our side to conduct this unjust war according to the usages of war between civilized nations, are too numerous to be named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>You are thoroughly posted up in regard to these matters; but seeing, as we do, that our <q>&#x0022;pearls have been cast before swine,&#x0022;</q> should we not now adopt a different course with our enemies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Would it not be well, as has been suggested, for each of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to receive and accommodate some of these prisoners of the <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessian</rs> army and navy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>I think we might accommodate a goodly number in our jails and forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>We are sure they would be well looked after by the present officer in command &mdash; the noble, patriotic, and ever to be remembered hero of that distinguished Fortress, who rendered so great and efficient service in effecting its surrender, and who would not, I think, feel any delicate scruples in meting out to these miserable ingrates their just deserts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Hoping that very soon the state of affairs with the enemy, as it is reported to exist in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, may undergo a very decided change, </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>We were immediately ordered to take position several miles to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>We had not been in position long, before it became evident we were in a warm neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The enemy's artillery, just in our front, but hid from our sight by a skirt of woods and an eminence between us, thundered forth its deadly missiles, and presently, too, the sharp, ringing crack of the rifle was heard, showing that the advance guard of skirmishers had met. Cavalry scouts could be seen, galloping within the lines, when a terrible volley of musketry, immediately in our front, assured us shat the ball had opened, and the fight had commenced in right good earnest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> Between <time value="9">9</time> and <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> <unclear>a m.,</unclear> the enemy, in tremendous force, advanced his right against our left, with the view of turning our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> and getting position in the rear of the <q>&#x0022;Junction.&#x0022;</q> They were met by several <orgName type="mil" key="SCRegiment">South Carolina regiments</orgName> (including <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s Legion) and the <orgName type="regiment" n="AL4">Alabama 4th</orgName>, our regiment (the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA5">5th Virginia</orgName>) being held in reserve; but soon we were ordered forward to support the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">4th Alabama</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>On our way to take position on a hill we were met by a portion of a <orgName type="mil" key="SCRegiment">South Carolina regiment</orgName> who had been compelled to fall back by an over whelming force, and who informed us that the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">4th Alabama</orgName> was being literally out to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>This was by no means encouraging, but we felt the necessity for greater exertion on our part, and forward we rushed to the assistance of our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Amid a perfect shower of musketry and cannon balls the command to half and lay down was given, as it was impossible for us to return the enemy's fire, they being completely sheltered by the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Not being able to return the enemy's fire, or even see them, our men cried out to be led forward or taken back to the foot of the hill; but our gallant <persName n="Harper,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Harper</surname></persName> assured us that he had no orders to advance, but was directed to occupy this position until the enemy should make their appearance, when we were to fire and charge bayonets. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> Finally, the order to advance was given, and under a perfect shower of shell and shot we arose and started up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>A portion of our regiment misunderstanding the order, we were thrown into temporary confusion; but soon called, and our gallant <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, <persName n="Baylor,,Wm,S.,H.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="default:Baylor,Wm,S.,H.,"><foreName>Wm</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Baylor</surname></persName>, taking the lead, we rushed forward and gained the position on the hill behind some old houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Before we gained position, however, the <orgName type="regiment" key="4ALRegiment">Fourth Alabama Regiment</orgName> had been compelled to retreat, and we found ourselves face to face with a powerful force of the enemy, and conspicuous among them was the famous Ellsworth Zouaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We fired a telling volley of musketry into the regiment in our front, which drove them rapidly to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>This drew the fire of those on our left upon us, and while engaged with them, the <rs>Maine</rs> regiment on our right, (who we supposed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be friends,) advanced rapidly upon us, and sheltering themselves by lying down behind a fence, they poured a most destructive fire into our ranks, and here some of our best and bravest men fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It soon became evident that with our single regiment it was impossible to maintain the position, exposed as we were to a centre and <num value="2">two</num> raking flank fires from at least <num value="4">four</num> times our number. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> We therefore fell back to a skirt of woods some <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in the rear, where we were joined by a portion of the <orgName type="regiment" n="AL4">Alabama 4th</orgName>, who had fought so gallantly and suffered so terribly at the house on the hill before we came up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> The very part of the field the contest now raged, and desperate efforts were made by each party to gain some decided advantage, without apparent success, though they greatly out numbered us, and I looked on at the terrible and desperate strife without being able in my own mind, to determine which would be victors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> Greatly to the encouragement of our brave troops, who were so heroically struggling against superior numbers, several fresh batteries made their appearance, and took position on an eminence just to our left. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> These opened upon the enemy, whose main column was sheltered behind a gradually sloping hill, thickly covered by small timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>and protected by a part of the celebrated <placeName reg="Sherman Battery">Sherman Battery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>A tremendous cannonading now took place that far surpassed anything I ever imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>It appeared to me as if Heaven and earth were being rent asunder, so terrible was the crash and roar of the monster instruments of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Several times the enemy attempted to rally for a charge on our batteries; but whenever their lines came within, the terrible discharges of round shot and canister from our batteries swept them like chaff before the wind, their long and splendidly- formed lines fairly melting away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Yet the tremendous force before us seemed not to diminish, and every inch of ground was contested with sullen and determined force, our brave troops fighting with renewed energy and vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Being parched with thirst and almost exhausted, I ran down to what appeared to be a branch or mud hole, and drank copiously of the muddy water, and was just returning to my regiment when I met <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,James,D.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, who inquired of me to what regiment I belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>I told him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>I told him we were fighting bravely and well, but against large odds, and needed help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>He at once said, go join your regiment and tell them to hold their position, and in a few moments I will send reinforcements to their aid. I hurried back to my regiment with a lighter heart than I left it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> On reaching the top of a hill, I could see in the direction of <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName> a large column of men rapidly approaching, and filling past them, with the swiftness of the wind, was a splendid body of Cavalry, numbering probably a <num value="1000">thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>These came rushing on like a mighty torrent, with drawn sabres glittering in the evening's bright sunbeams, mounted on steeds who seemed to be maddened by the contest that was being waged by man against his fellow man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Our course was turned directly in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>We reached the top of an eminence, fired a volley and at a charge bayonets rushed down upon it.--We found every horse attached to the battery was either killed or disabled and not a man, except the dead and wounded were left with the guns. </p>

<head>Commercial independence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> An important movement has been inaugurated in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, by the call of a Convention of the <rs>Commercial</rs> classes of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, to take into consideration the means of ensuring the commercial independence of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It may be laid down as an axiom, that unless the commerce of a country be free and unshackled, its political independence can only be partial and precarious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> The commerce of the <rs>South</rs> has, for many years, been disgracefully dependent upon the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It eminently behooves us to inquire into the causes of this dependence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We have allowed the <rs>North</rs> gradually to usurp the entire management of our great staples; to ship them abroad on their own account; to collect the proceeds in specie, or in foreign goods, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prices, and to pay us for them in Northern wares at double cost, and in imported goods, with a large profit added to what they themselves paid for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The staples which we have sold to them have been taken by them at lower prices than <rs n="European" type="group">Europeans</rs>, have been charged; and the goods of their own manufacture, which they have returned us in payment, have been miserable in quality, and much higher than imported articles of good quality would have cost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> Besides the profits which they have made from us in the enhanced prices of the foreign goods, and in the extravagant prices of their own mean goods, which they have sold us in exchange for our staples consumed by themselves or shipped abroad on their own account, they have made large sums of money off of us by transporting our staples to market at higher rates of freight than <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> and <name>English</name> vessels would have charged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>They have also made <num value="2">two</num>-and <num value="0.005">a half per cent</num>, commissions, in and out, on our foreign business, by their agency in transacting that <unclear> </unclear> for us, which we could have managed better for ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> The value of the staples which the <rs>South</rs> exported to foreign countries was upwards of <num value="300000000">three hundred millions</num> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The value of these saint staples which she sent <persName n="North,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:North,nomatch:0"><surname>North</surname></persName>, for manufacture or consumption there, was upwards of a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The <rs>North</rs> thus managed a business for the <rs>South</rs> of more than <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>That section had the exclusive monopoly of the carrying trade between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, and so great an advantage in the foreign carrying trade of our staples as almost to amount to a monopoly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It would be a minimum estimate to say that their revenues from the carrying trade of the <rs>South</rs> was <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Their profits in the foreign and Northern merchandize that they sold was at least <num value="0.25">twenty five per cent.</num> or <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>And it would be a moderate calculation to place the amount of the commissions which their merchants and bankers charged on our business, and the expenses of Southern persons sojourning in their cities and at their watering places, at <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> Thus, the profits of the <rs>North</rs> on Southern trade was at least <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> a year; and all this sure, except such an amount as was fairly payable for the freight on our staples, was a clear earning of the <rs>North</rs>, and a useless expenditure or tribute submitted to by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It was natural that a section making at least <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars per annum out of another, which that other ought to have saved, grew rich, and like <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesucrun</hi> <q>&#x0022;waxed fat and kicked.&#x0022;</q> It was remarkable only in the circumstance <sic>that that</sic> other section submitted to the system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>That the <rs>South</rs> should remain impoverished, though the richest country on earth, and should fall into a state of abject commercial dependence, under the operation of such a system, was as inevitable as fate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> This exhausting drain and tribute could not go on without creating and maintaining a constant state of indebtedness from the <rs>South</rs> to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This indebtedness rivetted and aggravated the commercial dependence which ensued from the ruinous system of trade in operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The effect was to create a system of bank mortgages upon Southern staples, which concentrated in New York, the banking centre of the <rs>Union</rs>, the absolute control of Southern exports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>A planter near <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> or <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> could not anticipate the sale of his crop by borrowing money from the bank in <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> or <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, except on acceptances given by his commission merchant payable in New Orleans or <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The commission merchant in these cities could not borrow money to meet their acceptances on paper payable at home; but must give acceptances payable in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>So it was with tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The planter, relying upon the sale of his crop, could not borrow money of the <rs>Danville</rs> or <rs>Clarksville</rs> bank on his <q>&#x0022;accommodation note&#x0022;</q> payable at the home bank; but must make his paper payable at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; and the <rs>Richmond</rs> factor must, in his turn, put into the <rs>Richmond</rs> bank paper payable in New York, which is called <q> &#x0022;business paper;&#x0022;</q> for his note payable in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, called <q>&#x0022;accommodation paper,&#x0022;</q> would surely be thrown out. Thus, the <num value="150000000">hundred and fifty millions</num> of tribute to the <rs>North</rs> produced a system of individual indebtedness in the nature of bank mortgages on crops; and the vast net-work of banks in the <rs>South</rs> became the agents for investing New York with an absolute dominion over the staples of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> Wherever great balances of money are due exchanges are always in favor of that point; and the exchanges being in favor of <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> as against <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, and in favor of New York against <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, the banks make a premium on paper payable at the former points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>So with the banks of <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Clarksville, Clarke, Alabama" key="tgn,2003108">Clarkesville</placeName> as to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> paper, and with the banks of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as to New York paper; and as all this paper was only a mortgage on Southern staples, the proceeds of the staples when sold abroad, went to New York, the ultimate point of the maturity and payment of the paper based upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> Another result followed this course of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Not only did the money for Southern staples due at New York, under the system we have described go there; but the great bulk of the money of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> destined for the purchase of our staples, followed suit, and went there also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Thus it has come to pass, that few bills of exchange, comparatively, are drawn on <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> from the <rs>South</rs>; but the great bulk of them are drawn by New York, which has thus because the place of deposit for all moneys designed for the purchase of Southern staples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The Southern planters collect the proceeds of their crops, by means of bills drawn on New York; that is to say, by means of the paper drawn ultimately on New York, which we have described as passing through the net work of the <rs>Southern</rs> banks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> It has been proposed to strike at the root of this whole vicious system, by rendering illegal in Southern course all inland bills payable at any place in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It is for the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> to decide upon this proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The body will doubtless be much enlightened in its treatment of this important subject by the deliberations of the <orgName n="Commercial Convention" type="convention">Commercial Convention</orgName> which has been called in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> [From the <name>Examiner</name>.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> The subject of this memorial brings to light a serious injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It appears that, in contemplation of the invitation extended by Congress, a number of officers in the <rs>Federal</rs> revenue service resigned their places, and have since been in the most active and efficient service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Besides the general invitation referred to, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had passed an ordinance on the subject of resignations from the <rs>Federal</rs> service and the reinstatement of her citizens to equal rank, in which the <rs>Federal</rs> revenue service was mentioned particularly and by name as coming within the provision of reinstatement.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> It has been under these circumstances that a number of officers resigned from the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> revenue service, have entered that of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>There was, of course, no revenue service in the <rs>South</rs> to which they could be transferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>They have been generally engaged, however, in the same duties that our naval officers have been transferred to. In some instances they have been engaged in battery duty; in others, in the transportation of ordnance, and in others in the signal office. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Under this construction of the law, an appeal has been made to Congress to recognize the claims of this service as co-operating with the navy in all of the land duty to which naval officers as well as revenue officers have, in the absence of sea service, been assigned. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> At present, there is but little sea service of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The officers resigned from the <rs>Federal Revenue</rs> service have, in instances that we are informed of, performed the same duty as officers of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> detailed on shore duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Under these circumstances the justice of their recognition as an organized branch of the public service appears obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>If we are not mistaken, under an old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> law not repealed, the <name>Revenue</name> service was required to co-operate with the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> <q>&#x0022;in time of war.&#x0022;</q> The <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>What is to prevent it from recognizing the resigned officers from this branch of the <rs>Federal</rs> service, and transferring them to shore duty as well as naval officers, until future opportunities of sea service, we cannot see.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>At an early hour a report was in general circulation that a desperate conflict was going on at Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, and that no less than <num value="20">twenty</num> Federal war vessels were attacking our batteries in that neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>How such an idea got afloat, we are unable to say; yet its magnitude could do no less than create a sensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>After diligent inquiry, we could trace it to no authentic source, and arrived at the conclusion that there was no truth in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The rumor is that the heavy rains in the early part of the present week caused a great rise in the waters, and the <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs>, to the number of <num value="1700">1,700</num>, found it impossible to get back to the <rs>Maryland</rs> side.--some of the citizens, thinking the opportunity for a coup de main too good to be lost, dispatched messengers to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,James,D.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, informing bird of the situation of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/> It is easy to see that the <rs>Democratic</rs> leader in this State have made up their minds to bring forward fresh compromises as a means of saving the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>This is the real motive of their declining to join the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> in sustaining the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/> This is perfectly apparent from the guarded language of their call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>They repudiate the idea that the <rs>Union</rs> is to be severed, in which we heartily concur; but they also insist that the prosecution of the war shall be accompanied by the most liberal proffers of peace.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/> It is scarcely worth while to conjecture what kind of a reception such a proposal will meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>We accept, distinctly and confessedly, the position of inferiors; and whatever may be its sanctions, it is to be distinctly understood that whenever they become dissatisfied with them the <rs>South</rs> can force us to make such changes as they may deem desirable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>It was considered so invincible that Congressmen left their legislative seats and followed to witness the defeat and extermination of the rebels.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> A dispatch from <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> informs us that permits will not hereafter be required for the transportation of articles, not contraband of war, over the <orgName n="Nashville and Louisville Railroad" type="railroad">Nashville and Louisville Railroad</orgName>--such as produce, bagging and rope, fabrics, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c. In other words, such articles as the would-be oppressors of the <rs>South</rs> can make a fair profit, by sending among us, and that are not particularly needed for war, they desire to force upon us. But such as they suppose we cannot well manage to dispense with, they pronounce to be unlawful and will not permit to reach us. Wherever they know we have an abundance of an article, or can find a substitute for it, they wish to force upon us the hateful competition of their trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/> This is the case with produce, bagging, fabrics, &#x0026;c. The South will this year make provisions enough to feed the entire <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>If we do, we shall present the strange spectacle, of enriching a people with <num value="1">one</num> hand and fighting them with another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>It is to conciliate the <rs>Western</rs> people, who will begin to move, with decision, against the war, in the fall, unless they can find a market for the crop they have made this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/> We trust not. We call upon them promptly and effectively to stop such shipments, and, at the same time, that they protect our own people, deprive the enemy of the means of carrying on the war.
