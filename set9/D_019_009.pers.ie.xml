<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> When I answered your kind letter of invitation on behalf of the <orgName n="Arrangements Committee" type="committee">Committee of Arrangements</orgName>, to dine with the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Society on the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="22">22d inst.</day></dateStruct>, I entertained strong hopes that it would be in my power to attend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Yesterday I received another letter from our friend <persName n="Stetson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stetson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stetson</surname></persName> renewing the invitation, and urging its acceptance, that we might commune together on the condition of the nation; but I cannot leave home, and deeply regret the necessity which compels me to decline it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> I feel that I have been singularly unfortunate in never having had it in my power to accept any <num value="1">one</num> of the numerous invitations to these Pilgrim meetings with which I have been honored; but necessity has no law, and I must submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><num value="1">One</num> thing that reconciles me to the disappointment is, that while our country is in its present distracted and diseased condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I am in no mood and have no heart for festivities of any sort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> You meet to celebrate the landing of the <rs>Pilgrim Fathers</rs>, and to keep alive a grateful recollection of the toils, the hardships, the sufferings and sacrifices they endured, in behalf of the great blessings of the freedom of conscience and freedom of speech; which through the mighty deeds of their descendants, <hi rend="italics">your fathers</hi> aided by the no less gallant and holy' works of our <hi rend="italics">fathers,</hi> were secured to <hi rend="italics">you</hi> and to <hi rend="italics">us</hi> as a common brotherhood by the most perfect and unexceptional system of government that the world has ever devised &mdash; a government that has alike excited the wonder, the admiration, and the hopes of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The more I look into that system, and the deeper I penetrate into all its profundity, the more I am struck with its wonderful perfection, and with the superior wisdom, sagacity and fore sight displayed in its formation in every part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A system of government under which we have lived and prospered, as no people have ever lived and prospered before, and under which, with a proper spirit of philanthropy, courtesy, forbearance and unusual explanation, we could continue to live in the full enjoyment of advantages and blessings never before vouchsafed to man on earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> And yet, gentlemen, as a <hi rend="italics">perfect and harmonious whole,</hi> before you meet at the festive board, at the close of this week, this system will probably be no more; it will be numbered among the things that were, and that have passed away, to be seen and felt &#x0022; <hi rend="italics">never no more.</hi>&#x0022; perhaps &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">forever</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Before the sun shall have passed again over our continent from the time at which I write, we shall probably be rent asunder, <num value="1">one</num> State of the <rs>Union</rs> will have rudely and violently robbed our flag of <num value="1">one</num> star; <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in his mercy grant that it may stop at that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Even now, while I write at the dead hour of night, mischief makers and conspirators are at work to tear down the whole edifice of freedom to trample that flag in the dust, and to make us the jest and the scorn of civilization </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Can this not be averted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Are there no means by which the balance of the <rs>Union</rs> can be preserved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It rests with you, gentlemen of the <rs>North</rs>, to determine the question, and there is no time for delay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> I have given abundant proof that I do not sympathize with <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> in her rash and impetuous action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If she is determined to go let us do all that men can do to prevent any other State from following her pernicious example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>She does not desire to be <hi rend="italics">of </hi> us, nor <hi rend="italics">with</hi> us, nor <hi rend="italics">among</hi> us. She does not seek to have her grievances redressed, and I would take no pains to redress them <hi rend="italics">as far as she is concerned.</hi> She goes out because she has no wish to remain in, but it is not so with the other disaffected States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They can be retained, and retained with honor to themselves and to you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> You tell me that by the repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, and the attempt to force slavery into the <placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Territory of Kansas</placeName> through the agency of the fraudulent Lecompton Constitution, the <rs>South</rs> has done great wrong to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><hi rend="italics">I know it,</hi> and I have said it <hi rend="italics">when,</hi> and I have said it <hi rend="italics">where</hi> it was no light matter to say it &mdash; when I stood as <num value="1">one</num> singled out from a whole community, but I say also that the <rs>North</rs>, by the passage of the <rs>Personal Liberty</rs> bills, so far as they were designed to obstruct the execution of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>, and by the general interference of their citizens with the subject of slavery in the <name>States</name>, have done great wrong to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Both have done wrong, and both must repair the errors of the past. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> You tell me again, that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the party he represents have no design to interfere with the relation of master and slaves in the <name>States</name> where slavery exists by law. I answer, <hi rend="italics">I believe it</hi>--nay, <hi rend="italics">I know it</hi>--I know that the foulest misrepresentations are constantly made, and industriously circulated, by mischievous men and mischievous papers, to inflame the public mind; I know that great misunderstanding prevails between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the country, but to which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I thank my Maker, I have never by word or deed contributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>On the contrary, I have incurred unjust censure and reproach and suspicion at home, in consequence of my efforts to preserve a fairer and better understanding between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>; because I saw from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that, if this flame was fanned and not checked, it would ultimately lead to the present disastrous condition of things. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> But, gentlemen permit me to say that this is no time to inquire who threw the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stone, or which section is most to blame; this is no time to stand upon ceremony, or upon etiquette; this is no time for bravado and defiance; and whosoever indulges in it either in Congress or out of it, will meet with a nation's contempt and a nation's curse.--The existence of an Empire is at stake: the happiness and the fortunes of <num value="1000000">millions</num> at home, and of mankind over a large portion of the world, is in the balance, and the only question should be which shall be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to come forward and tender the olive branch of peace, saying in solemn, earnest, strains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><hi rend="italics">Brothers, let us be friends again.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Whichever party is the most forward and active in atonement for the past, whichever yields the most to freedom and to the <rs>Union</rs>, will surely enjoy the larger share of reputation <hi rend="italics">for manliness, magnanimity and love of country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Yours</hi> is the larger and more powerful section; you cannot be suspected of any base timidity in a sacrifice for reconciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><hi rend="italics">Yours</hi> is the <hi rend="italics">successful party,</hi> now to come into power; you are in no danger of having any of your rights disturbed; you labor under no apprehension of the loss or ruin of your property; you can afford not only to be just, but to be <hi rend="italics">generous,</hi> Magnanimous and great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>For the sake of our common country, I beg you to display these high and ennobling qualities as far as your own honor will permit you to go. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Let the <rs>North</rs> give assurance in some authoritative and unmistakable form that it is not its purpose to interfere with any vested rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>; that whatever has been unwisely and unconstitutionally done shall be instantaneously undone, and that they will meet the disaffected Southern States in the spirit of that harmony and fraternal kindness, for the settlement of all the present difficulties, and let each section extend to the other <hi rend="italics">forgiveness for the past and security for the future.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> There is but <num value="1">one</num> person alive whose position would entitle him to speak for the whole, and whose voice is sufficiently potential to allay the impending strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I could wish that in this extreme exigency of the <rs>State</rs>, surrounded as we are with danger on every side, that he could find it compatible with his sense of propriety to anticipate, by a few weeks, the duty that will devolve upon him on the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and indicate a policy, as I feel assured he would, that would relieve all present uneasiness, and afford more time for ultimate settlement of details. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> There are a great many intemperate and unreasonable men in the <rs>South</rs> each <num value="1">one</num> of whom has his particular followers, but all of whom would be abandoned if such a policy were pursued; for I do not believe there is a majority in any <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> (<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> excepted, and we may count her out for the present,) that would claim more as a condition of their adhesion to the <rs>Union</rs> than they would be fairly entitled to under the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it was made for us, and which we all acknowledge ourselves bound to obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If a difference of interpretation should arise, how easy it would be to make a case and carry it at once before the judicial tribunal established for the purpose, and let its decision be final and conclusive with all parties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> may be asked for which may or may not be yielded, but all that any State is at liberty to demand, or that any State will be sustained in demanding, will be a fair, honest and faithful execution of the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the laws made in pursuance thereof, and if this is not cheerfully accorded, the <rs>Union</rs> cannot and ought not to last; but if yielded, and further demands are made outside of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in order to occasion difficulty, then the party that adheres to the present Constitution as it is relieves itself of all responsibility for the consequences that may ensue by virtue of the course pursued by those who seek a departure from it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> At all times deprecating and abjuring sectionalism, in whatever form it might assume, whether in the <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, I have for many years stood up in the face of this Southern community, unaided and alone, as the only apology at and defender of the <rs>North</rs>; because, on every recurrence of disaffection and distrust, I snuffed ultimate disunion in the tainted breeze I had no confidence that men who would abrogate the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> would respect the <rs>Constitution</rs> any longer than it secured to them the powers of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I have endorsed the integrity and patriotism of the great body of our Northern brethren, when all others shrunk back disheartened and dismayed, until I have been left a single mark for the shafts of my own party, as well as of my political opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>My motives have fallen under the injurious and unjust suspicion that I was actuated by a desire to advance my own political fortunes with the <rs>North</rs> when not <num value="1">one</num> man in <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> in the <rs>North</rs> knew what I had said or done; while it was whispered and mattered and shouted, in every Southern car &mdash; My position and principles of nationality, to which I have been, perhaps, a too zealous devotee, have been rudely assailed; and when they have proved impregnable and could not be overthrown in order to destroy such influence as I had, my character, both personally and politically, has been traduced and aligned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Yet never an inch did I budge; and it is this which gives me a claim <hi rend="italics">as your endorser,</hi> to appeal to you as <hi rend="italics">friends,</hi> in the name of a common country, and in view of a common destiny, to come forward and vindicate yourselves from the foul aspersions that have been cast upon you because of the misconduct of a handful of intemperate, misguided, fanatical and desperate men in your midst, who have been suffered, so far, to pass not only unpunished, but almost unrebuked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> I will not ask you to vindicate my endorsement of your fidelity to the <rs>Union</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <hi rend="italics">and the enforcement of the laws, for my own sake,</hi> because it matters little to any but my own family what becomes of me; but I do ask it, I entreat it, and, without meaning to be presumptuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I <hi rend="italics">demand</hi> it, for your own sakes, and for the sake of a common country, which now hangs suspended by a hair, awaiting the decision of the sons of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, the descendants of the <rs>Pilgrim Fathers</rs>, whose spirits will look down upon you at the festive board, and add their entreaties to mine, that you will save us from a common and inevitable ruin, by exerting the influence you hold, each <num value="1">one</num> with his native heath, to have full justice administered, peace restored, prosperity continued, and the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> perpetuated for ages and ages yet to come. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> If I have not deceived myself, this will be done by the conservative men who constitute the majority and the worth of the <rs>North</rs>; and, if I am deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I shall only have to confess the errors of my past life, retrace my steps, and make atonement to those whom I may have misted in my too earnest zeal to act the part of peacemaker to the great National family of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>We suppose there is no community, as there is no individual, free from faults, or at any rate from little eccentricities and foibles, which give exquisite satisfaction to their enemies, and under which even their best friends are not altogether inconsolable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The impression the enemies of the latter now wish to convey is, that she is a brawling, gasconading State, always blustering and talking about fighting, but only needing to have her jaws soundly boxed, to scamper off, whining and yelping like a whipped cur. The South <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> do not seem to be much moved by this calumny, and, indeed, they could pursue no better policy, if that were their object, than to permit their detractors to underrate the enemy with whom they have to deal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> However we may differ from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, in the policy of separate State action, we feel bound to do justice to the character of her people, unscrupulously maligned as it is by the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>We have never failed to do justice to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>We have always discriminated between the sound and true men of that region and the unfriendly and the false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>We have especially, and for many years, endeavored to disabuse the <rs>Southern</rs> mind of certain erroneous ideas of <num value="2">two</num> qualities of Northern character &mdash; courage and generosity--<num value="2">two</num> qualities for which, in point of fact, it is pre-eminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>We have shown that, whilst Northern men were educated to regard duelling as murder, they have never been found wanting when their country called them to the field; and that, in point of fact, the great naval victories of the late war were nearly all achieved by Northern men. And we now assure the <rs>South</rs> that, in defending its own rights, it can make no greater mistake than to underrate the prowess of its enemies whilst at the same time it may derive encouragement from the fact that no nation ever yet lived, which, fighting on its own soil, fighting for its firesides, its wives and its children, was not equal to <num value="5">five</num> times the number of its invaders, no matter how brave and determined those invaders might be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> But whilst doing justice to a section in which a party now rules who are preparing to draw the sword upon the <rs>South</rs>, we may be permitted, we hope, without treason, to suggest that the misrepresentations of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> character in the <rs>North</rs> are quite as gross and monstrous as any which prevail of Northern character in the <rs>South</rs>.--There is no surer test of the character of a people than the purity of their private life, and the fact that there has never been a divorce in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> since the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs>, is an example of exalted domestic virtue such as the whole world does not surpass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>If it be true that &#x0022;Righteousness exalted a nation,&#x0022; then a people of whom this can be said are not to be despised by anybody, and least of all, by those dissolute and licentious organs of Socialism and Free Love, which are now affecting to look down upon <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> as a despicable and contemptible race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>In regard to another virtue, integrity in business transactions, we will leave it to any candid enemy of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, any truthful business man of the <rs>North</rs>, himself to decide whether there is a people in <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName> more faithful and rigid in all their pecuniary engagements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The virtues of hospitality and of liberality no <num value="1">one</num> denies them, and the noble institutions of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> for the relief of orphans are unsurpassed in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>In regard to religion, we suppose there is no State in the <rs>Union</rs> which has, in proportion to population, as many churches and professors of religion, and as little infidelity; whilst, at the same time, there is a noble spirit of toleration amongst all denominations, and between <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholics</rs> and <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestants</rs> such as we rarely find elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The population of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> is as thoroughly church-going as <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> was in its best days, and there is <num value="1">one</num> church alone which has <num value="2500">2,500</num> <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> communicants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>It may be mentioned here that the religious education of the negroes is more carefully and thoroughly attended to in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> than in any other Southern State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>They are not permitted, as in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, to hold separate assemblies; but in every church of every denomination the most ample accommodations are provided for this class of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Nor are the <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> as demonstrative in their manners as is generally supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>There is more reserve, and sometimes apparent coldness, than among some communities in the free States; but at the same time, when the ice of formality is broken, a heart as warm as that of Old Virginia &mdash; and there-can be nothing warmer and nobler than that &mdash; beats beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>We say nothing of the courage of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>--that must speak for itself, but those who doubt it, if they are her enemies, will doubt it to their own disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>We do not agree with her polities, but justice requires us to say, what we know by personal intercourse with her people, that no better men and women live anywhere in this round globe than the men and women of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>. </p>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/> --<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> sent in a message to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>In it he says the affairs of the country are growing worse, instead of better, and hope is still more diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Alluding to the condition of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, he says there is no other alternative but to collect the revenues and protect the public property there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>It is his duty to execute the laws of the nation &mdash; not inquire into their justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>He says, at the commencement of the session, he recommended measures of relief, which, as he believed, would have the effect of tranquilizing the country and save it from the perils in which it has been needlessly and unfortunately placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>His convictions then expressed remain unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>The right and duty to use the military and naval force against those who illegally assail the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, are clear and indisputable, but the present state of things is entirely beyond Executive control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>We are in the midst of a great revolution, and he recommends to Congress itself to meet the present emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>To Congress alone is delegated the power to declare war, and to remove grievances which might lead to war, and restore peace to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>On it rests the responsibility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/> After eulogizing the blessings conferred by the <rs>Union</rs>, he says that should it perish, the calamity will be as severe in the <rs>Southern</rs> as in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The secession feeling is chiefly founded on an apprehension as to the sentiment of a majority of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Let the question be transferred from a political assembly to the ballot-box, and the people will redress their grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>In this, our heaviest calamity, let a trial be made, before we plunge into the assumption that there is no alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Let us have reflection.--Would that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had reflected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> He appeals to Congressmen to say, in their might, that the <rs>Union</rs> shall and must be preserved, and recommends them to devote themselves to strong action, with a view to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>A division on the line of <num value="36">36</num> deg, <num value="30">30</num> min, is suggested as calculated to produce an adjustment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>It is an imputation on members to say that they will hesitate at such a movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>The danger is on us. In several States forts and arsenals have been seized by aggressive acts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/> He states as reasons why he refused to send troops to <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, that this would have furnished a pretext, if not provocation, for aggression, on the part of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, Referring to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00367" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Cora,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, he says that officer could not, before he left <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, have held the place more than <num value="48">forty-eight</num> or <measure n="60hours" type="date">sixty hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/> He (the <rs>President</rs>) had warned the country of its danger, and felt that his duty had been faithfully, though imperfectly, performed.--He was conscious that he meant well for his country. </p> </div3>

I'll buy my aunt twice as handsome a brooch this very day, but I'll not have Norah suspected and my missus plagued. --There's for you.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Then need'st know naught about it.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/> He went to the police-station, and made a statement of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>He was gratified by the impression which the evidence against Norah seemed to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>The men all agreed in his opinion, and steps were to be immediately taken to find out where she was. Most probably, as they suggested, she had gone at once to the man, who, to all appearance, was her lover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>When <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00500" reg="nearbymention:Chadwick,David,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> asked how they would find her out, they smiled, shock their heads, and spoke of mysterious but infallible ways and means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>He returned to his nephew's house with a very comfortable opinion of his own sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>He was met by his wife with a penitent face. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> &#x0022;Oh, master, I've found my brooch!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>It was just sticking by its pin in the flounce of my brown silk, that I wore yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>I took it off in a hurry, and it must have caught in it; and I hung up my gown in the closet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Just now, when I was going to fold it up, there was the brooch!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>I'm very vexed, but I never dreamed but what it was lost.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/> Her husband, muttering something very like &#x0022;Confound thee and thy brooch, too!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>I wish I'd never given it thee,&#x0022; snatched up his hat and rushed back to the station, hoping to be in time to stop the police from searching for Norah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>But a detective was already gone off on the errand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/> Where was Norah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>Half mad with the strain of the fearful secret, she had hardly slept through the night for thinking what must be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Upon this terrible state of mind had come Ailsie's questions, showing that she had seen the man, as the unconscious child called her father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>Lastly came the suspicion of her honesty.
