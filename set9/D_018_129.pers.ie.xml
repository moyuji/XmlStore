<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The Governor of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has sent in his message to the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He thinks temporary postal arrangements can be made with <orgName><persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co</orgName>,'s Express until those of a permanent character can be entered into., The duties of the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> "in future" will be so much more arduous than in the past, that the salary of the office should be increased and a private secretary allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Referring to the laws of the new republic on the subject of treason, he says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The general recognition by the citizens of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> of their allegiance to the <rs>State</rs>, and that obedience to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> ceases as soon as the <rs>State</rs> withdraws from the <rs>Union</rs> and asserts her sovereignty, satisfies me that she will have no traitors in her limits; but a wise precaution can result in no harm, and may be the means of advertising our people that if any of them should be so forgetful of their duty to their sovereign, and so reckless of his displeasure as to disregard her Ordinances, or obey any other commands than those of the constituted authorities of the <rs>State</rs>, they will be dealt with as traitors, and punished accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>In view, therefore, of such a contingency, some legislation may be necessary in more particularly defining treason to the <rs>State</rs>, and affixing the proper punishment for the offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> must insist upon the implicit obedience of all her citizens, both native and naturalized, and no <num value="1">one</num> can be permitted to put his individual construction upon the relation he bears to the <rs>State</rs> of his birth or adoption.--The obligation of the citizens of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to obey the laws of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was created by the act of the <rs>State</rs> entering the <rs>Union</rs> under the compact entered into by the sovereign parties to it, and it follows that upon the withdrawal of the <rs>State</rs> the obligation is no longer binding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The secession of a State cannot, in the proper use of terms, be called a revolutionary movement.--It is true, there will, to some extent, be a change of government, such as dissolving a compact between sovereigns, in which it was stipulated that the citizens or subjects of each State or nation should perform certain duties, which, before the agreement of the high contracting parties, they were not required to perform, or abstain from the exercise of certain rights, which they have previously enjoyed; but this dissolution of a compact does not imply rebellion, which, if successful, is revolution, and which, if unsuccessful, subjects the citizens to punishment for committing treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Why are we at this moment citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Because <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, in her sovereign capacity, made us so by a compact entered into with the other States, which, when united, were called the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and it follows that when the power that ordered us to obey the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and which alone had the right to create that relationship, releases us from that obligation by withdrawing from the league, our obedience is no longer due to that Government, and our allegiance to the <rs>State</rs>, as our lawful sovereign, is unquestionable and undivided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The introduction of slaves from other States, which may not become members of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and particularly the border States, should be prohibited by legislative enactment, and by this means they will be brought to see that their safety depends upon a withdrawal from their enemies, and an union with their friends and natural allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>If they should continue their union with the non slaveholding States, let them keep their slave property in their own borders, and the only alternative left them will be emancipation by their own act, or by the action of their confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>We cannot consent to relieve them from their embarrassing situation, by permitting them to realize the money value for their slaves, by selling them to us, and thus prepare them, without any loss of property, to accommodate themselves to the <rs>Northern</rs> free-soil idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>But should they unite their destiny with us, and become stars in the <rs>Southern</rs> galaxy &mdash; members of a great Southern Confederation &mdash; we will receive them with open arms and an enthusiastic greeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Should, then, danger approach their borders, or an enemy, open or disguised, make war upon them, there is not a doubt but a living rampart of freemen, from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>, would line their borders and beat back the invaders. </p> </q><bibl n="Governor of South Carolina"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The Governor then speaks of &#x0022;Federal Relations.&#x0022; He gives a history of <persName n="Hemminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Hemminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hemminger</surname></persName>'s mission to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, where he was &#x0022;kindly received and hospitably entertained,&#x0022; but failed to convince the <name>Legislature</name> of the necessity of concentrated action on the part of the <rs>South</rs>: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the resolutions adopted by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> in response to the invitation of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to meet in conference, expresses the opinion that &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> does not yet distrust the capacity of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, by a wise and firm exercise of their reserved powers, to protect the rights and liberties of the people, and to preserve the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>,&#x0022; and for this purpose she desires the &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">concurrent action</hi>&#x0022; of the <rs>Southern States</rs>; but she adds &#x0022;that efficient co-operation will be more safely obtained by such direct legislative action of the <hi rend="italics">several States</hi> as may be necessary and proper, than through the agency of an assemblage which can exercise no legitimate power except to debate and advise.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> Thus we see that although <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had strong hopes at that time of preserving the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, she was unwilling to resort to any other way of effecting the object than by the <hi rend="italics">separate action of each State,</hi> which would have the effect of producing the <hi rend="italics">concurrent action</hi> of all the <name>States</name> interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> It will be remembered that this time last year this term was <num value="1">one</num> of reproach among <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> journals at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> press heaped its bittered sarcasms upon those meetings, and directed their keenest ridicule at the prominent participators in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>They were called sneeringly and contemptuously &#x0022;Union Savers.&#x0022; Th8e most selfish and sordid motives were attributed to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>The glowing eloquence and patriotic fervor of the distinguished orators of the day who were attempting to stay the tide that was sweeping the country to the gulf of disunion, excited the liveliest and most grateful emotions in Southern hearts, but at the <rs>North</rs> they were unheeded and had no other effect than to make the speakers the objects of vindictive assaults of the <name>Satanic</name> press and pulpit.--Their worst apprehensions are about to be realized, and their warnings, then disregarded, threaten to become true prophecies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> The scene is now changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Those who ridiculed the "Union Savers" are discovering at last that the <rs>Union</rs> is in danger, and are about to try their own hand at "Union saving."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Even <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Weed,,Thurlow,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.00210" reg="default:Weed,Thurlow,,,"><foreName>Thurlow</foreName> <surname>Weed</surname></persName>,</hi> the great <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> wire-worker of <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, sees something really alarming, and is making suggestions as to means of compromising our troubles, and "forming a more perfect Union."--He suggests repeals of State laws inconsistent with the laws of Congress, and that the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law be amended so as to make it less obnoxious to the <rs>North</rs>, with all "needful power for its execution."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>He also suggests that a provision be incorporated "making counties where fugitives are rescued by violence from officers who have them in charge liable for the value of the slaves rescued."--This is a new and remarkable proposition to come from such <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>, and a very practical <num value="1">one</num> indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>But <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Weed,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0004.00000.00211" reg="nearbymention:Weed,Thurlow,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Weed</surname></persName>'s</hi> suggestions <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> since would have been more efficacious perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>They could then make no concessions to the spirit of patriotism &mdash; no offering to the good of the country.--They were engaged in saving their party then and ridiculed the "Union Savers," whose patriotism was arrayed against their sectionalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Having brought the country to the brink of dissolution, they now themselves are undertaking the task of Union saving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>They profess to regret many things, and desire to undo others.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/> On the <date value="02-21">21st of February,</date> the cold struck me as increasing in severity; I therefore determined not to lose an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>I had to open a passage wide enough for the sledge to pass through; but I could throw back the snow into the chalet, and that made my task easier.--I immediately set to work, and labored at it so heavily that at last I felt tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>I was obliged to rest a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>I lighted a fire. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought was that the wolves had got scent of me, and that they were on the point of devouring me. I violently shut to the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>I answered with all my strength. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>In a few minutes, a tolerably wide opening completed the passage which I had begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>It was my father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>He scarcely waited for the breach in the snow to be fairly open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>He darted with a cry into the chalet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>He knelt beside the grave; I did the same; and, as I endeavored to tell him in detail what had passed, he saw, by my agitation, that the attempt was beyond my strength. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/> The men who accompanied him had entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>They were my <num value="2">two</num> uncles, and <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName>, our servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>My father took me by the hand, and laid on my shoulder a light gun which I knew how to use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/> <q>&#x0022;This is not the time,&#x0022;</q> he said, <q>&#x0022;to remove my father's mortal remains.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/> We retired for an instant into the dairy; my uncles were with us. After a few moments of silence, my father, all in tears, exclaimed, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/> <q>&#x0022;Adieu ! father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>No doubt I am doing what you would request me to do, in removing this lad as soon as possible, whose fate must have caused you as much apprehension as it has given us. Father, adieu !&#x0022;p</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/> We departed; our eyes were full of tears.--The descent was rapid but fatiguing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>I was especially dizzied by the fight of the sun and the brilliancy of the snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>The cold was severe, and I did not complain; it was what had saved me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/> After traveling over the snow with no other accident than sinking in a little from time to time, we arrived at the spot, still a long way from the village, up to which they had opened the road in their endeavors to reach us. I was astonished to see the immense labor it must have cost; and I comprehended that, without the frost, a long time must still have elapsed before I could be delivered. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>You must know, my dear <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>, that our neighbors have been wanting neither in charity nor zeal; but, within the memory of man, never was there such a heavy fall of snow.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/> My father then informed me of a very unfortunate circumstance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>He nearly lost his life from the sliding of a mass of snow, as he was descending the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>They picked him up in a dying state at the edge of a ravine, and, a few paces further on they found my grandfather's stick, and my bottle. </p> 
<p>
