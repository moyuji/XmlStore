<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Undeterred by the terrible artillery fire, they moved forward until (when near the base of the ridge) a murderous fire of infantry was opened from behind stone walls and scattered houses, which so swept them down that they were forced to retreat, but were speedily formed again, when out of the severest fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>A new attack was organized at once to support the retiring force, and the men, unappalled by the storm of cannon projectiles which made great gaps in their ranks, advanced in splendid style, with fixed bayonets, but were also compelled to fall back under the withering infantry fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>They were soon rallied; but although artillery firing was kept up during the afternoon, no further attempt was made to attack by the centre that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The character and strength of the defences had thus, however, been experimentally ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The question naturally arises &mdash; how is the safety of our army provided for in case they should be hard pressed by the enemy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>We reply, that the bridges upon which they crossed remain; the others will, as soon as possible, be repaired; some <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> is left in position on this bank to defend the crossing, and, although the gunboats, or the most of them, cannot come up to the city, they can come so near it &mdash; say within <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>--as to make them a very strong and easy <hi rend="italics">point d'appul,</hi> in case of disaster; but we are more hopeful than ever that there will be no disaster.
