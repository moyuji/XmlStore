<head>The flag and seal.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> The <orgName n="Senate Committee" type="committee">Senate committee</orgName>, it is understood, has completed their designs of the flag and seal for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The flag is a white field with the well known battle flag of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, (<persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s flag) in a square of blue at the upper corner, near the staff, and a blue horizontal bar across the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Willing to accept almost anything in preference to the present despised parody upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> flag, we should yet prefer the battle flag itself to the modification of it proposed by the committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>At the beginning of the war, owing to the close resemblance between the <rs>Confederate</rs> and Federal flags, each party often accused the other of the fraud of holding its eugenicist's flag for the purpose of deception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Both parties were mistaken, and each was possibly deluded by the mistake into some unfortunate movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> was so thoroughly convinced of the danger of going into battle with a flag to much like that of the enemy that he caused to be adopted in the field the well known battle flag &mdash; illustrious for the many victories was beneath its folds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>It is simple, neat, and very distinct from a long distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It answers the purpose of a flag very well, is easily made, and is not obnoxious to any serious objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>We are sure the conflicting counsels of a body of men not deeply skilled in heraldry, will not produce anything to appropriate, and likely to engross to much the public approval and love as the <rs>Potomac</rs> battle flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>A great many battles must be fought, and a great many victories must be won under another to make it so famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The change made by the committee is no improvement of it. We trust that at least the blue bar across the committee's flag may be stricken out by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Let us be done with the <hi rend="italics">bare</hi> at all events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>It would be grateful to the nation, we are sure, if all parties would compromise on the glorious battle flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It is already consecrated by our best blood, and many of the most brilliant victories in the annuals of war. It should, therefore, be cherished with affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>How can we discard it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>With what feeling can we lay it away in the archives as a moment of the nation's glory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Can we hide it away from the eyes of the people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Do what we will with it, it is hardly probable that the army will give it up. Congressmen may suggest variations upon it, or may distaste a new banner to the veterans of so many bloody fields; but they will not abandon the flag they have fought and conquered under, and which they have learned to love as the emblem of their triumphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It must indeed be something better than any yet devised that could reduce them from this <hi rend="italics">invincible battle flag</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> The seal represents the equestrian statue of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, after that on the <rs type="place">Capitol Square</rs>, with appropriate bordering and back ground, and the motto, &#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics"><persName n="Deo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Deo,nomatch:0"><surname>Deo</surname></persName> duc vincimus</hi></foreign>&#x0022; which in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, freely rendered, is, &#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> being with us, we will conquer.&#x0022; The people care less about the seal than the flag; and we suppose there will be no objection to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It will certainly be satisfactory in so far as it contains the figure of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> The Congress has been too long in the making of the flag, certainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>It is to be hoped they will now settle both questions of flag and seal, and end debate about them. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
