<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, this Senate will not consider a graver question than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It will not consider a question that is more fixed on the public mind than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I believe that a great deal of undue clamor has been made by particular against the <name>Administration</name> on the ground of these arrests; but if it has been so, it has been because of the manner of these arrests, and the manner in which the men arrested have been discharged, the failure to give them an examination, and to make public the causes of the arrests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>These are the reasons why the clamor has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I know that in the canvass in our own State, and gentlemen from <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and New York say to me that these arrests, sometimes made in secret for frivolous and unimportant matter, sometimes for foolish and bad language, sometimes for good cause, have been made the occasion of eloquent declamation. </p> </q><bibl n="Mr. shannon"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Every person who has heard the story of these pretended wrongs has sympathized with probably a guilty man, simply because that guilty man has not had a chance of a fair trial before some tribunal, or because the facts which led to his arrest have not been made public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I do not care who desires an inquiry if a Senator will in his place say that <num value="1">one</num> of his constituents has been deprived of his liberty, and that he believes he has been unjustly deprived of that liberty, that he desires to know the cause why he is detained in a military prison, we are bound to give him that information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If you do not do it, what will be the consequence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>You may be the cause of an injustice without a remedy, and without any limit of duration except life itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We know very well that they cannot appeal to the <rs type="place">Courts</rs>, because the very attempt to appeal to the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> might create an armed controversy between State and National authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> In the future the danger is still more imminent than it has been in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the past in the fresh enthusiasm of the people, in their real and earnestness to sustain the <name>Administration</name> and to prosecute the war, they have probably allowed a great many things to pass unnoticed that they will not in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Hereafter you will have men to call you to strict account for every act even of lawful seizure.--Let us be prepared to defend every act with full information given to us in an official form, so that when any <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> here says, &#x0022;My constituent has been arrested and held unlawfully in your military prison,&#x0022; you can turn him to the record and say, &#x0022;That citizen fired upon the flag of his country; that citizen openly prevented the enlistment of volunteers to defend, that flag, that citizen committed this or that crime.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> And, sir, when we are able thus to defend the <name>Administration</name> for every arrest made by if we can go before the people of our country and demand their sympathy, their aid, their support, in the prosecution of the war; but if we waste the enthusiasm of our people, and allow these side issues to lead us off into <unclear>col-</unclear> unlawful force, we take from ourselves strength that we want to use against the common enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Every thing that tends to divide us, to distract us, to divide our people into parties and classes, to excite sympathy against the <rs>Government</rs>, or anger against the <rs>Government</rs>, whether well or ill-founded, weakens us, and thus deprives us of strength which it is necessary for us to use in order to put down this rebellion. </p> </div4>

<head>The Administration.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> &#x0022;<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> alluded very briefly to the falsehoods which had been circulated relative to the <name>Administration</name>, which he could not disprove, because such disapproval would give the enemy a knowledge of things which the good of the cause required to be concealed from him. That he committed some errors he did not doubt, though they were never the result of improper motives.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> We copy the above from a report of the speech of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Davis,B.,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> to the <orgName n="Mississippi Legislature" type="legislature">Mississippi Legislature</orgName> at <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>, published in this paper a few days ago. It seems to us that this reply of the <rs>President</rs> ought to be satisfactory to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Every reasonable man must see that the public interests might be dangerously compromised if the <rs>Government</rs> should undertake to set forth the reasons of its action in every case where the public does not know, and, from its want of knowledge, does not approve the course of the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>How was it possible, for example, for that poorness soldier and gentleman, <persName n="Johnston,General,Albert,Sidney,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="default:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, to be defended against the storm of obloquy which was raised upon his head without exposing our own weakness at a moment when the exposure would have been rain? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> Faith is necessary in all human affairs, and in none more than those of a weak and struggling country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The agents to whom it has itself confined the conduct of its Government deserve a generous confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We cannot expect to understand the ground of their action always, for we have not the information by which their conduct is directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>That they may off sometimes is simply to acknowledge that they are human and not infallible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>But that error is the rule in the <rs>Southern Administration</rs>, instead of the exception and that it errs from design or improper motives, no ere will pretend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>For ourselves, we are no partizan of any Government or any party, but we believe that <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Davis,B.,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> is as well qualified for his responsible position as any man in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and that he has as much interest as any other in exerting his best abilities and judgment in the performance of his public duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The failure of this struggle would not only involve him in the common ruin of independence and property, but bring down upon his head a doom which the great mass of the <rs>Southern</rs> people have no reason to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>How absurd, then, to imagine that he is not doing the best he can for the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The same confidence may be justly extended to our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> and soldiers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We must not expect impossibilities of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>We are outnumbered by our enemies <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, and without the men or the means to meet them at many of the points at which we are assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>All we can expect is that they should do the best they can with the limited means at their disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>And surely the annals of history furnish no example of achievements like those of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers against the odds they have had to encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>For the sake of our common cause, let us not add to our weakness by dissensions among ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Let us postpone till the end of this great quarrel every note of internal bickering, and know no enemies but the enemies of our country. </p> </div3>
