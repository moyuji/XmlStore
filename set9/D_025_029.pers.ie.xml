<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> puts forth this morning a stirring appeal to the <rs>Confederates</rs> who are absent from their commands, or who owe service to their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>It is the day and hour for struggle and trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The enemy plainly shows his policy by the powerful efforts he is making at concentration of his strength for an overwhelming movement against us. His success would bring upon us all the evils enumerated by the earnest appeal of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>In the past we have the best assurance that his appeal will be promptly responded to; and if our men only continue true and faithful to their reputations, to their own and their country's honor it will be all the better that the enemy adopts the policy of massing his troops and concentrating his energies for a great struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>A repulse will be all the more disastrous to him, all the more advantageous to us. It is only by really great battles and victories that we can end the war and gain our independence Partial engagements and raids contribute little to the end. When the heroic sons of the <rs>South</rs> enter the great fields to meet the hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of the enemy, let them think of this and fight as though a victory over the invader would end the war. We should be, therefore, gratified that the signs are favorable to these earnest and massive collisions with the enemy, and prepare to meet him with alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Rightly interpreted they afford the best hope of the early and favorable solution of the great struggle in which we are embarked. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>At last accounts the enemy's forces were assembling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We take for granted that the new commander &mdash; who is a young man &mdash; will essay some new strategy; but he cannot probably make a very material change from those that have been attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>He must try to pierce our lines upon some of the defensible points between here and the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and that will be very likely the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It is certainly the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cheering news of battle that we have had for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It is this view, more than for its extent as at present advised, that causes it to be hailed with peculiar pleasure by the people of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> It is but just, while on the subject, to say that <persName n="Taylor,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00286" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> has achieved more than any other of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the <rs>Southwest</rs> the present year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>He seems, indeed, to have been the only <num value="1">one</num> of them all who has been very active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> About the time of the battles of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> it will be remembered that a number of papers in the hands of <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00290" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s aids was captured by the enemy, under circumstances annoying to us to say the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>There were letters from <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00291" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Cooper,Adjutant General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00292" reg="nearbymention:Cooper,S.,,,"><roleName n="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName> in the list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The enemy made a great noise about them, and pretended to give their purport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They represented the <rs>President</rs> as regretting <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00293" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s advance into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, intimating that it was made under the mistaken impression that the interval between the time of the discharge of the large number of trained Federal troops and the arrival of others to take their places would afford opportunity for his operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>We have at last gotten the letter itself through the <rs>Northern</rs> press, and publish it this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>It will be seen that it contains not <num value="1">one</num> word in disapprobation of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00294" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It relates wholly to the situation here and in the <name>South</name> and <name>South</name>west, and the impossibility of sending the <rs>General</rs> reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The adroit <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> thought they could make more out of the letter by misrepresenting it than by publishing it entire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It was so short that there was no other excuse for not publishing the letter itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> The letter was written while <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00295" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName> and Keys were dodging about the peninsula, endeavoring to discern a hole through which they could creep, if possible, without fighting, into <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>They did not find it and contented themselves with stealing what fell in their way <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> and departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The exaggerations of that meanest and most contemptible invading force that ever sat face towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; save <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00296" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s &mdash; might well inspire some concern about matters here, and a disinclination to part with troops to send towards the <rs>Potomac</rs>. --There is no indication in the <rs>President</rs>'s letter of any concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>let alone disapprobation of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00297" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s movements. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> While on the subject we venture, however, to remark, as we did not choose to do pending the excitement here, that we trust that the events of <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00298" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName>'s advance and retreat with impunity, and the fact that his forces were not even equal in <hi rend="italics">numbers</hi> to our own, will afford a lesson for the future that will be of value to the <rs>Government</rs> and the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In <num value="2">two</num> impudent raids of the enemy near this city no body of men and no General has acquired ordinary credit, not to speak of <unclear>eclat,</unclear> save the little band which so gallantly but vainly defended the <rs type="place">South Anna bridge</rs> on the <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central railroad</orgName>, and the brave regiment that repulsed the large force of the enemy at the <rs type="place">South Anna bridge</rs> on the <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>We look back upon them now with astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The fact is almost incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Should such movements of the enemy be attempted again and terminate in a like manner, then indeed we might conclude that we can command neither enterprise, military strategy, nor ordinary common sense, in the local defence of the capital. </p> </div3>
