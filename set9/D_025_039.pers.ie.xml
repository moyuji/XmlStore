<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The old were so much worn that a new suit was indispensable to the good appearance of the paper, and, our readers may sometimes have been ready to add, its legibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>By dint of care and attention, the press work has recently maintained the passable and even legible character of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> but even the best efforts in this way could not long have made even tolerable the impression upon the faithful, war worn types, which we are now glad to be able to set at liberty. </p> </div3>

<head>Lincoln the permanent <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> A gentleman of respectability who formerly represented <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> border counties in the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName>, was recently arrested by Federal authority and taken to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He was after a time liberated, and was by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s order conducted into his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The Northern <rs type="role2">President</rs> asked him &#x0022;how long did the <rs>Southern</rs> people think this war would last?&#x0022; The reply was, &#x0022;They think it will end with your administration. &#x0022; <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> very coolly rejoined, &#x0022;That will probably last as long as I live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This is no time for elections!&#x0022; These are nearly the exact words of the conversation as reported by good authority to us. Whether it be correctly reported or not, we are well convinced of <num value="1">one</num> thing, and that is: that if this war does not and before the time of electing the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Federal States</rs>, nobody will be allowed to be elected save <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Aut C</hi>&#x00E6;sar <foreign lang="lat">aut nullus.</foreign> &#x0022; If he is not to be chosen, the ballot-box will either not be opened, or will be so disposed of after being opened, as to end in defeating any change of rulers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The public sentiment, if not for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, will be overridden by the military authority, and the <rs>Northern</rs> people will at last have realized the fact, already patent to the world, that they are completely enslaved by the vilest and most vulgar despotism on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>At present a part of the <rs>Northern</rs> people are fired by fanaticism, and malignity and haired towards the <rs>South</rs>; another portion are absorbed, heart and soul, by the hopes and &#x0022;calculations&#x0022; of recovering the trade of the <rs>South</rs>, with its vast gains, which have filled their land with wealth and adorned it with temples and palaces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>A few only of the population are aware of the true nature of the circumstances that surround them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>These, and none other, see that besotted tyranny which pervades their country and is entering into their very households, like the frogs of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Yet, bold, impudent, and domineering as that tyranny is, it will have to be more clearly developed to open the eyes of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>When <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is permanent <rs type="role2">President</rs>, when domiciliary visits, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments, without accusation, are multiplied without number &mdash; when the rights of people, the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> trial by jury, and all popular security, are ended &mdash; they may wake up from the delusion which has veiled their eyes while helping to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>That they have submitted up to this time to the oppressions and outrages of their Government encourages the opinion that they will hardly resist when the time of the matured existence of the tyranny arrives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If they should not, of course they do not deserve to be free.--The course and ill bred tyrant that oppresses them will be worthy of them and they of him. </p> </div3>

<head>The blockade trade.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The <hi rend="italics">Sentinel,</hi> of yesterday, while congratulating itself upon the prohibition of the introduction of goods from the enemy's country within our military lines, states that &#x0022;the powers of the <rs>Executive</rs> are not adequate to the correction of the evil of blockade running where it exists in its chief strength,&#x0022; viz.: by the sea going vessels arriving at our ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It further says that &#x0022;Congress has authorized trade with neutral countries, and it is not for the <rs>President</rs> to forbid it.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> That the trade carried on directly through the border with the enemy, has been very demoralizing in its effects, and that it has been the means of transmission of much information detrimental to the <rs>South</rs>, there can be no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The drain of gold to the enemy's country by that way has been considerable, and has been disadvantageous to us and beneficial to him. To stop this trade is a desideratum, and it is to be hoped that the <rs>Government</rs> will be successful in its effort for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It has a strong cooperation in the increased perils of the enterprise; for as the trade was lawless, and those who pursued it sought hidden routes and did much of their business in the obscurity of night, they have become the game of another class, whose calling is favored by like circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><num value="1">One</num> of the blockade runners is known to have been murdered and robbed, and the route has become infested with the land sharks, who think they have immunity in preying upon the contraband fish who pursue it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> It is true, indeed, that the main trade from without is through the blockade-running ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Nevertheless, a smart traffic was carried on through our frontier lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The checking of the latter will only stimulate to some extent the former; and little can be accomplished in the effort to exclude <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> goods from the <rs>Confederacy</rs> until the laws are so amended as to take effect upon the contraband commerce of the ocean. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It is well known that the great bulk of the goods entered at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and elsewhere are from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is no mistaking them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Everybody knows them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>As cotton or gold has been paid for these goods, a large drain has been kept up upon our resources for the benefit of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <sic>industsy</sic> and capital.--The enemy has been strengthened and we weakened by it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The question will be whether the introduction of the fabrics of the enemy, whom we hate and with whom we desire to have nothing to do, can be excluded as long as we have any foreign trade whatever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Is there any mode by which they are certainly to be known and effectually interdicted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It is hard to say. They will resort to every expedient of change and imitation necessary to evade law and elude vigilance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If they cannot be shut out without shutting out all commerce, or at least confining the foreign trade to Government vessels, the next question is can either or both these latter expedients be put in operation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They are questions of difficulty, and will exercise the wisdom of Congress not a little. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He was a noisy and boasting impostor, who swindled everybody who would trust him. He taught the sword exercise, being a sort of master in that way.
