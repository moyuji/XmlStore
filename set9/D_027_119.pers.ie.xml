<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> In the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, transmitted to Congress along with the <name>Presidential</name> message, that officer fully sustains the recommendation, often made by us, to abolish the system of requiring every cavalryman to own his own horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Enormous abuses, according to the <rs>Secretary</rs>, have sprung up from this fruitful source of demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The owners of the horses are, in general, young men who are not able to stand the loss of the animals, or to supply his place when he dies in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Unless he be killed in actual battle, he receives no pay for him, while the chances are <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, if the horse die, that he is not killed in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Cavalrymen, then, who have joined the service, just as they become well drilled and capable of doing effectual service, are liable, every day, to be dismounted and reduced to the ranks, while some raw hand comes in to supply his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Or, if he lose his horse and have the means to buy another, he is sent off, on what is called a horse detail, to supply himself with another charger, and he never returns to the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He goes to his own neighborhood, returns to his old habits of life, takes care to keep out of the way of the enrolling officer, and becomes a deserter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Or, if he be disposed to go back, he always finds an excuse for putting off the terrible day; for to him it has become terrible by long indulgence at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>He cannot find a horse to suit him, or he cannot afford to pay the price demanded for <num value="1">one</num> that he likes, or he has some other excuse; and never goes back until he can stay no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>These are but a few of the evils of this system and their necessary consequence, horse details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They lead to pillaging and irregularity of every kind; so that it is becoming a serious question which is the most destructive to a neighborhood: our own men in search of horses, or the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> bent upon the same errand? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> We have never meant, in our strictures upon the cavalry service, to deny to that arm great usefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>They have rendered brilliant service to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, undoubtedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Nor, we are glad to find, are they justly chargeable with all that has been alleged against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/><persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, in a communication published in the newspapers, acquits them of all blame in the affair of the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th ultimo</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>This thing, however, of owning their own horses is fatal to their efficiency; and we are glad to see the attention of Congress has been turned to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> The cavalry in our service have never had a fair chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It has, we believe, often been the case that officers of infantry and artillery have been promoted for gallant service in the respective arms to which they belong to high office in the cavalry over the heads of cavalry officers of worth and service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>This cannot be right in any sense of the word.--It is injurious to the service in every possible way; injurious to that arm of it (infantry or artillery) from which the promotion is made, by depriving it of a good officer, who has just shown his effectiveness in that particular branch; injurious to the cavalry, since his service was not cavalry service; and his promotion having been made at the expense of some brave and friendless cavalry officer, creates discontent, heart-burning, and often even worse among the officers, leading to carelessness in the discharge of their duties and to consequent demoralization among the men. We should be glad to see this corrected altogether; or, if that be impossible, so far, at least, as the good of the service may allow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> We have understood that there are a number of foreign cavalry officers in our service who understand the sword exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Why cannot some of them be detailed to form a school of instruction during the winter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>A single man could be the means of having a whole division of cavalry taught in a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>We have heard it stated by officers of cavalry that the great improvement in fire-arms has rendered impossible, for the future, all such charges as made the reputation of Siedlitz and <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>A charge cannot be effectively made, it is said, from a distance greater than <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>, while the long-range guns carry a <num value="1000">thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>There may be some truth in this, but cavalry in rapid motion are hard to hit, and we should think not many balls would strike at a range of a <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">thousand yards</measure>. It is close firing, after all, that does the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>At any rate, it seems to us very important still that cavalry should understand the use of the sabre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> We have heard objections to the proposed new arrangement on account of the expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>That is a serious consideration, it is true,--a very serious consideration,--especially in the present condition of prices and the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>But it is a question between the entire disuse of cavalry and the incurring of the necessary expense to keep them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It is plain that the present system will not do. </p> </div3>
