<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The State elections will probably, many of them, remain in doubt for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The choice of Governor, from the returns received, lies between <persName n="Smith,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Wm,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> and <persName n="Flournoy,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Flournoy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Flournoy</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The result must be settled by the army vote, and it will be some time before it can be received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>So is it with reference to the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Governor">Lieutenant Governor</rs>, for which <persName n="Price,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Price,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName> and <persName n="Imboden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Imboden</surname></persName> are the leading candidates Several of the <rs>Congressional Districts</rs> are left in the same situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The army has the casting vote. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This may be kept in doubt, also, by the army vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The other districts are entirely in the hands of refugees and soldiers in the army.

<head><placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The fate of this place is still suspended in the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our own telegrams have been encouraging but they lacked the definiteness essential in such a case to bring entire relief to the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> bulletins in the interim are unpleasantly detailed and specific &mdash; well calculated to unsettle conclusions and inferences based upon the cheering but vague accounts from our own side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The suspense, however, cannot long be continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It will be interrupted no doubt by some decisive event in a few days &mdash; may be, hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The hopes and opinions of those who know the locality are strongly in favor of the impregnability of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The general feeling, after what it has stood, is that, it will not be carried by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The resistance has been, from all accounts, determined, and let us continue to hope and believe will be successful. </p> </div3>

<head>Demeanor towards <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The Southern public has been astonished lately by the report that Southern ladies had displayed some courtesies to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners taken by <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>; presenting them with bouquets and cigars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is probable that under the feeling of indignation the demonstration excited the extent of it may have been exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <orgName n="Augusta Constitutionalist" type="newspaper">Augusta <hi rend="italics">Constitutionalist</hi></orgName> states that these courtesies, which have been &#x0022;so justly denounced, were not the result of sympathy with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cause, or approval of the infamous manner in which that cause is sought to be advanced.&#x0022; It declares that in every instance brought to its knowledge they were &#x0022;the fruits of silly thoughtlessness or of no less silly and mistaken notion of policy.&#x0022;--But it was very reprehensible; for, as the <hi rend="italics">Constitutionalist</hi> says: <q>&#x0022;Folly no less than fear sometimes betrays like treason.&#x0022;</q> Small foundation though it be, it will be enough for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to build an immense &#x0022;Union sentiment at the <rs>South</rs>&#x0022; upon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> This journal has always advocated the humane and merciful treatment of prisoners of war, and has condemned all denunciations of them, by those in whose power they are. It is true, there has been but little occasion for this condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is not in accordance with Southern taste or manners to treat with cruelty a brute when he is captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is true, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their dismal, devilish dungeons, have tortured the life out of Southern gentlemen; but words are not the proper answer to crimes like these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>On the other hand, courtesies and gifts bestowed upon such incarnate wretches by Southern ladies are even more reprehensible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We are happy to be assured that Southern ladies, in any considerable number, have not been guilty of such silly and indecent conduct, exhibiting an utter want of appreciation of what is due to the cause, to the noble defenders of it, who are bleeding and dying in their behalf, and to the wretches whose hands are stained with the blood of their champion's and kindred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Let prisoners of war be treated with humanity, but let women keep away from them altogether, showing no manner of curiosity even to look at them, much less to address them in terms either of denunciation or courtesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If compelled by circumstances to speak to them, when in the power of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the most frigid and distant reserve is the only kind of treatment which they will understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We could wish, indeed, that neither men nor women would have anything more to say to them than is absolutely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We should as soon think of holding a long parley with a captured burglar or incendiary, asking him what business he had to try to rob and burn and murder us, as to hold a like conversation with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Our whole department to the invader, whether in the battle-field or as prisoners, should speak the <num value="1">one</num> sentiment of the <rs>South</rs>--we want nothing to do with you. </p> </div3>

<head>Our Glorious Soldiers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> An intelligent gentleman, who was an eye witness of the late battle near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, says that highly as the efficiency of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Jonathan,N.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had been extolled, nothing he had heard came up to the impression produced on his mind by his own observation of their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Their deeds of valor were not only magnificent beyond all conception, but the cheerfulness with which, after being for a great part of the day involved in the most terrific peril, they would, as soon as successful, march for miles to some new scene of danger, was absolutely marvellous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Their conduct when wounded was even more admirable.--Our informant has seen groups of the wounded standing around a well, each waiting patiently his turn for water, bleeding, dusty, weak in body, yet as humble, modest, and unpretending as so many children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Wonderful men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>What age or country has produced such?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Such lions in battle, and yet so unconscious of their own greatness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Such are the rank and file of the <rs>Southern</rs> army, men whom it is an honor to live in the same age with. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="5">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> For this gentleman we have a great deal of respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He has indeed put his views about the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> and the termination of the rebellion &mdash; in a constitutional way &mdash; in a rather strong light to suit our tastes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But he has, nevertheless, declared that he believed </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> that war was not the way to restore it, and we believe that the war once suspended ends it finally, at least between the present parties on the present issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>We should not wonder if he thought so himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Moreover, he has been bold and defiant in his opposition to the tyrannies of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the objects and manner of the war. In this he has exhibited the spirit of manliness and independence that challenges admiration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> In deciding the question of what course we should pursue with regard to him, the personal considerations should be kindly and respectful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He, however, comes not as a refugee, and, it appears from the accounts of the scene of his introduction to our territory, not as <num value="1">one</num> asking shelter and protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>On the contrary, he declared himself a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> &#x0022;and loyal to them.&#x0022; To our officers, on being as it were, shoved in at the door, he said, <q>&#x0022;I am a citizen of the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName> and of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I am here by force and against my will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I, therefore, surrender myself to you as a prisoner of war. &#x0022;</q>--This happened just inside the lines of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It is plain that <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> does not mean to embarrass our Government by making any appeal to it. Indeed, we think it plain that he would prefer that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities should send him back through <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>'s lines, in order that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> shall be forced to complete his case within it own territory &mdash; that his sentence and its penalty should be consummated in his own country among his own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>This would be good policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The issue before the bar of public opinion in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could not be properly tried in any other way.
