<head>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> retreat from <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The Northern news published by us yesterday morning of the retreat of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> under <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson, Mississippi</placeName>, is confirmed by our own Southern telegraph this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>They left precipitately, after doing what harm they could, and of course stealing what could be conveniently carried off.--The retreat was no doubt superinduced by the movements of <persName n="Gen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Gen,nomatch:0"><surname>Gen</surname></persName>- <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> on the chessboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is said to have retreated towards <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The language of Southwestern telegraphs is mysterious generally, and we do not lay much stress upon phraseology which sometimes involves consequential suggestions, for the telegrapher does not mean anything by it. It is usually a mere blundering way of stating things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We take it that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has simply put off upon the speediest out to the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, which is through <placeName reg="Raymond, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057320">Raymond</placeName>, whence he came, and down the <placeName key="tgn,1121887" n="1.000 9" reg="big black, mississippi, united states">Big Black river</placeName>, That stream lies between <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If he retreats to avoid <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s strategy he would most assuredly fall completely into the net if he moved upon <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The hot term is about commencing in the <rs>Southwest</rs> and the enemy has accomplished literally nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>What he can expect to achieve now it is impossible to say; but a few weeks will develop what he can do. Our own people are confident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We have well equipped, well drilled, and brave troops in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The main armies there have the co-operation of the best and most enterprising cavalry, whose raids have astonished and greatly perplexed the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, especially those of the iron-clad horses,&#x0022; who have taken so many gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The whole force is in excellent condition, and will give the best account of itself whenever the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invader can be brought face to face with it. </p> </div3>

<head>The lesson of the aid,</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> We are not at all surprised that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> boast so hugely of the <name>Stoneman</name> raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is true that it did very little damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The injuries to the railroads were very slight, and soon repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But all this matters not to them.--Their journals will fabricate any amount of damage that the <rs>Northern</rs> appetite can demand and the gullibility of the world can swallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We are not disposed, however, to underrate the importance of the lesson which this raid teaches, and the disasters which may ensue if it is not taken to heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The damage the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid actually accomplished was nothing; what it <hi rend="italics">might</hi> have done, (with such a cavalry leader as <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>,) incalculable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We are not so sure that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> made an empty boast when they say they could have dashed suddenly through <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and, perhaps, made our <rs type="role2">President</rs> prisoner!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In the darkness and confusion they might have fired the public buildings, storehouses, and bridges, and inflicted a loss which might have proved fatal to our noble army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>All this they <hi rend="italics">might</hi> have done, and all this they <hi rend="italics">will </hi> yet do, if the authorities, whose duty it is to protect the city and the railroads leading to it, do not learn a lesson from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid.-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> When we hear in mind the strong force and sleepless energy with which <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> is guarded, it seems wonderful that our own capital should be left in a condition so exposed that <num value="200">two hundred</num>. <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can ride within <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> of the town and absolutely go to sleep, keeping time with their snores to the ringing of the city bells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Sundering the ties which bound him to loved ones there, he eagerly went forth to battle for liberty, and nobly, thrice nobly, did he perform his part in the thrilling scenes that succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He participated in every campaign in which his regiment was engaged, and was never absent when the painful realities of battle tested the true soldier.
