<head>The old and the <rs>New</rs> revolution.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> There are so many points of resemblance between the exigencies and trails of the revolution of <num value="176">176</num> and that now progressing in the <rs>South</rs>, that it is both instructive and encouraging to recur to the history of the former just at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The Southern patrict cannot fall to derive consolation and support in his hour of anxiety by studying these resemblances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>,</hi> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, has so briefly and clearly presented them to its readers that we cannot do better than copy what it says, and commend it to general perusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We therefore place its article very prominently in our columns, as follows: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The reverses of the revolutionary War.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> In the gloom which follows our recent reverses, we turn to the great example of our ancestors in a struggle very similar to that in which we are engaged, in its origin as well as its incidents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The war of the <name>Revolution</name> was <num value="1">one</num> in which the disparity of the contending powers was far greater than at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <rs>British</rs> had every advantage that numbers, experience in warfare, and unlimited resources could give them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The colonists were in awe of the superior skill and force of their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They were almost without artillery, their small arms were of the most indifferent description, and insufficient for their troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Their armies were badly clad and badly provided with stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They were enlisted for very short terms, and therefore badly disciplined and drilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The people of every colony were more or less divided in opinion as to the rightfulness of the contest, and some, as New York, furnished as many troops to <num value="1">one</num> side as the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The course of the contest was sufficient to have discouraged any but the most resolute natures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <rs>British</rs> had taken months for the most elaborate preparations to subdue the colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They were supreme by sea. <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> had concentrated his forces at New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He had <num value="27000">27,000</num> men. The enemy had <num value="24000">24,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He undertook to defend <placeName key="tgn,7015824" n="1.000 2" reg="long island city, queens, new york">Long Island</placeName>, upon which he erected defences and stationed troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <rs>British</rs> landed troops, <hi rend="italics">turned his left flank, routed his army, and <measure n="2000" type="captured">captured 2,000</measure> men.</hi> The remainder were fortunate enough to escape to the mainland. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> army was then in great part withdrawn from the city, but such was the terror inspired by the superior military skill attributed to the <rs>British</rs>, that the force stationed for the defence of a <orgName n="Water Battery" type="battery">water battery</orgName> fled from the bombardment of the enemy, and <num value="2">two</num> brigades, sent to their aid, were so infected with panic that they retreated without firing a gun or seeing the enemy, and in spite of the remonstrances of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> and their own officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> New York was then abandoned, with the loss of <hi rend="italics">all our artillery, much of our army stores, provisions, tents, &#x0026;c.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> army behaved better at <placeName reg="White Plains, Westchester, New York" key="tgn,7014623">White Plains</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But it was pursued by other disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><placeName key="tgn,2047120" n="1.000 4" reg="fort washington, prince georges, maryland">Fort Washington</placeName>--rather against the advice of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>--was defended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The garrison made a gallant defence, killing several <num value="100">hundred</num> <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs>; but the <rs>British</rs> advanced in <num value="3">three</num> columns, and drove the garrison within the fort, where it surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><hi rend="italics">The <name>British</name> <measure n="2500" type="captured">captured two thousand five hundred</measure> men, with military stores, and a strong position.</hi> This was considered the greatest calamity of the war. <placeName key="tgn,2064769" n="1.000 1" reg="fort lee, bergen, new jersey">Fort Lee</placeName> fell next &mdash; the troops were withdrawn, but <hi rend="italics">all the armament and supplies, including <num value="300">three hundred</num> tents, fell into the hands of the enemy.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The effect of these blows, falling with such weight and rapidity, was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The historian says the troops quitted the army <q>&#x0022;by regiments, half regiments, and companies, &#x0022;</q> <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> crossed into the <name>Jerseys</name>, into which he was followed by a victorious enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><hi rend="italics">He then headed an army of only <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men,</hi> besides some detachments under <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> yielded without resistance, and no <num value="1">one</num> who looked on the <q>&#x0022;ragged&#x0022; </q> handful of <q>&#x0022;<rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>,&#x0022;</q> as they retreated before the superior force of the disciplined and appointed army which pursued them, could doubt that <q>&#x0022;the contest approached its termination.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It is unnecessary to follow the narrative of reverses, which ought to be read by every <num value="1">one</num>, and republished for the inspection of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, undismayed, turned in his celebrated night march across the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, <measure n="1000" type="captured">captured 1,000</measure> men, with arms and stores, and returned in safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But nothing else occurred for months to break the current of <name>British</name> successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Their army embarked in the next campaign, and for weeks <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> was ignorant of their destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>To avoid the forts which he had erected on the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, they ascended the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> to march overland upon <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, who had again recruited his temporary army, resisted their advance at <placeName key="tgn,2046349" n="1.000 1" reg="brandywine, prince george's, maryland">Brandywine</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Here, leaving a force to threaten the fords in front, the enemy made a <hi rend="italics">detour and turned our right flank.</hi> The <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, after a short resistance withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> made yet another stand to save <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>; but a violent rain so completely drenched his men that their <hi rend="italics">whole stock of ammunition was rendered unfit for use,</hi> and the army was compelled to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is stated that at this time there were scarcely <num value="2">two</num> guns of the same calibre in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><num value="1">One</num> regiment reviewed <hi rend="italics"><num value="90">ninety</num> muskets and <num value="7">seven</num> bayonets.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> Our night attack on <placeName reg="Germantown, Philadelphia, Philadelphia" key="tgn,7014057">Germantown</placeName> was a failure, and the enemy held <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> without farther molestation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Their next object was to open the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> wished to preserve his forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We strengthened, and threw men into them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The enemy were repulsed in a land attack on <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Then they brought their ships to bear, and <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">shelled </hi>&#x0022;</q> the forts until they were no longer tenable, and were abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> seemed never afterwards to have resisted the <rs>British</rs> on the water </hi> or near the water &mdash; if we except the capture of <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The <rs>British</rs> were supreme on that element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In his own words: <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">To protect the coast from an enemy entirely in possession of the sea is impracticable.</hi>&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> But <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> never disbanded his army, and his victories were chiefly in the interior where the enemy was compelled to pursue him on their theory of subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> We look with apprehension upon the numerous expeditions of our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>How was it with the invasion of our ancestors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>A large <name>British</name> army held New York and the <name>Jerseys</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Another lay unmolested at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>An expedition, under <persName n="Burgoyne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Burgoyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Burgoyne</surname></persName>, came in through <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It is well that the precaution had been taken at a seasonable time to provision it and place it in such a position as to withstand the blockade which has been established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Time will do much and it is not at all probable that, though the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may be delayed, defeated in their attempt to capture the city, they will be able to maintain their position long without recourse to some vigorous action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It is a source of great regret that we have no means at our command to drive them from the river, a little energy and foresight, timely exerted, might have prevented their occupation; a <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName> could have been built, indeed could yet be built, iron-clad and bomb-proof, affording every security to the men and capable of withstanding, nay, dispersing the whole fleet of petty depredators now so materially harassing us and offering indignity to our faces. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> Mechanics could be found in this city to construct such a work, if authorized, in <num value="1">one</num> month, and to place it in such a position as will most effectually accomplish its desired object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>These batteries are earthen works, unprotected by casemates, and in this view deficient; but they are the result of the utmost labor and careful construction, and, from the nature of the soil, it would have been exceedingly difficult to render them bomb-proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Still I think the attempt should have been made to render them so. Our experience has been dearly purchased, and we should not neglect its teachings, notwithstanding the losses in such engagements have been small on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>I trust our military servants will explain this to our satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It is a mystery why, with so little loss, all our salient points that have been attacked have been carried with such ease.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> The last foreign advices bring us indications of fresh troubles in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The populace of <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName> once more are making a dramatical demonstration against their rulers, and preparing to light again the flames of civil war. Time was when the <rs>South</rs>, which had been trained to echo the public sentiment of the <rs>North</rs>, and really believed that the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> were very much oppressed, sympathized with every popular movement which was started on that continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>But it has of late discovered that its worst enemies in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are the insurrectionists, and its only friends the conservative classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>In <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, the scene of the present agitations, and, we suppose, in most of the large <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> towns, it has been customary to dramatize the most execrable misrepresentations of slavery at the popular theatres, in which the character of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was painted in the most frightful colors, and a horrible retribution visited upon their wives and daughters in the midst of the most frenzied applause of the dirty mob whose imagined sorrows our people have so often and profoundly commiserated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> The Southern revolution, which is a conservative and constitutional, and not a radical and agrarian movement, which has for its object the protection of property and constitutional liberty, has of course no friends among those who make war upon property and whose only idea of liberty is that which prevailed in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revolution, and which perpetrated more horrors upon humanity than it had ever suffered from despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We cannot expect the sympathies of such people in our cause, nor, now that we understand their true character, can they expect ours in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The experience of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has satisfied us that the extremes of Democracy and Despotism gravitate towards each other, and that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as naturally end in the last as the clouds dissolve in rain and the rivers empty into the sea. The section of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which has always boasted of having the largest liberty, has proved itself more oppressive than any despot of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in its treatment of the weaker section; and its chosen tools for their subjugation have been those very revolutionary emigrants whose sufferings we were won't to sympathize with in days gone by, and whose civil and religious rights the <rs>South</rs>, <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> ago, rescued from a Know Nothing Northern crusade, which, if successful, would have driven them back, as a lesser evil, to the despotisms from which they fled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> Under these circumstances, the future popular agitations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> can scarcely be expected to excite any interest in the <rs>South</rs>.--Our only friends there are the higher classes in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and on the continent, and even these, who ought to have the controlling influence upon the foreign as well as the domestic policy of their respective kingdoms, seem powerless to do more than wish as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>In return, we give them all we have, our own sympathies, and wish them a good deliverance from commotions and insurrections, which are to gain new strength and ultimate success, if the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is triumphant in the present conflict. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> This unfortunate old man has gotten very impotent and obese, but his malignity never grows old. He has good reason to hate <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>He has stained his sword in the blood of his mother to the hilt, but he stained it unsuccessfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>He has exhibited to her the basest ingratitude and the most murderous revenge, but all proved impotent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stamp of her foot, she crushed the mammoth humbug of his military reputation, and drove him not only from her borders, but from his own position as <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> of the <rs>Federal Army</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>She compelled him to give up the sword he had disgraced to a younger soldier and a better man; to <num value="1">one</num> who had the merit, at all events, of not invading his own section, and who, if <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> had stood in the relation to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, would have cut off his right hand before he would have plunged his sword in her heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> We can easily understand that there are men of Northern birth, who have never left their native soil, who yet sympathize profoundly with the <rs>South</rs>, and this is no treason either to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> or to their section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>For it is not their section which is invaded, and that makes all the difference in the world between a Northern man who sympathizes with the <rs>South</rs>, and a Southern man who sympathizes with the <rs>North</rs>, especially <num value="1">one</num> who, like <persName n="Scott,,Winfield,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="default:Scott,Winfield,,,"><foreName>Winfield</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, draws his sword against his native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We can respect even our honest Northern enemies, and we do respect them far more than the native born traitors who have plotted, toiled, and even fought to crush us to the dust.--hence it is that we rejoice to see that collapsed humbug, the late <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>, left to drivel out his imbecile venom in New York, with none so poor as do him reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It must be a sweet reflection to <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Winfield</foreName></persName></hi> (as he christened himself) in his old age, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> lost every battle whilst he continued <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>, and that it was not till he was prevailed upon to retire, under the impression that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> cause was going to the bottom, and give place to another man, that the tide of Northern reverses began to turn. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>But nobody will believe him. This war, which has revealed many men to the world in new and unexpected characters, has stripped the veil altogether from <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Winfield,,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s character as a man and his pretensions as a General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>His conduct to his old military contemporary, the veteran <rs>Wool</rs>, a better man than himself, whom he has contrived to throw in the background during the whole of the war, and whom he feared as a rival, shows that he is incapable of magnanimity, and can descend to any means for his own selfish purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Hence, in the effort to protect, by our arms, the whole of the territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, seaboard and inland, we have been so exposed as recently to encounter serious disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>When the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was formed the <name>States</name> composing it were, by the peculiar character of their pursuits, and a misplaced confidence in their former associates, to a great extent, destitute of the means for the prosecution of the war on so gigantic a scale as that which it has attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The workshops and artisans were mainly to be found in the <rs>Northern States</rs>; and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duties which devolved upon this Government was to establish the necessary manufactories, and in the meantime to obtain, by purchase from abroad, as far as practicable, whatever was required for the public defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>No effort has been spared to effect both these ends; and, though the results have not equalled our hopes, it is believed that an impartial judgement will, upon full investigation, award to the various departments of the <rs>Government</rs> credit for having done all which human power and foresight enabled them to accomplish. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>They have not yet reached me, and I am, therefore, unable to communicate to you such information of those events and the consequences resulting from them, as would enable me to make recommendations founded upon the changed condition which they have produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Enough is known of the surrender at <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName> to make us feel that it was deeply humiliating, however imperfect may have been the preparations for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The hope is still entertained that our reported losses at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> have been greatly exaggerated, inasmuch as I am not only unwilling, but unable to believe that a large army of our people have surrendered without a desperate effort to cut their way through investing forces, whatever may have been their numbers, and to endeavor to make a junction with other divisions of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>But in the absence of that exact information which can only be afforded by official reports, it would be premature to pass judgment, and my own is reserved, as I trust yours will be, until that information is received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>In the meantime, strenuous efforts have been made to throw forward reinforcements to the armies at the positions threatened, and I cannot doubt that the bitter disappointments we have borne, by nerving the people to still greater exertions, will speedily secure results more accordant with our just expectation, and as favorable to our cause as those which marked the earlier periods of the war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/> They afford the cheering hope that our resources, limited as they were at the beginning of the contest, will, during its progress, become developed to such an extent as fully to meet our future wants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/> The policy of enlistment for short terms, against which I have steadily contended from the commencement of the war, has in my judgment, contributed in no immaterial degree to the recent reverses which we have suffered, and even now render it difficult to furnish you an accurate statement of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>When the war <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> broke out many of our people could with difficulty be persuaded that it would belong or serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>It was not deemed possible that anything so insane as a persistent attempt to subjugate these States could be made; still less that the delusion would so far prevail as to give to the war the vast proportions which it has assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The people, incredulous of a long war, were naturally averse to long enlistments, and the early legislation of Congress rendered it impracticable to obtain volunteers for a greater period than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/> The quotas of new regiments for the war, called for from the different States, are in rapid progress of organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>The whole body of new levies and re-enlisted men will probably be ready in the ranks within the next <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>They may, in general terms, be stated at <num value="400">four hundred</num> regiments of infantry, with a proportionate force of cavalry and artillery, the details of which will be shown by the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>I deem it proper to advert to the fact that the process of furloughs and re-enlistment in progress for the last month had so far disorganized and weakened our forces as to impair our ability for successful defence; but I heartily congratulate you that this evil, which I had foreseen and was powerless to prevent, may now be said to be substantially at an end, and that we shall not again during the war be exposed to seeing our strength diminished by this fruitful cause of disaster &mdash; short enlistments. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> being principally engaged in agricultural pursuits, were unprovided at the commencement of hostilities with ships, ship-yards, materials for ship- building, or skilled mechanics and seamen in sufficient numbers, to make the prompt creation of a navy a practical task even if the required appropriations had been made for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>I appear to you to respond promptly to this call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/><num value="400">Four hundred</num> men of this regiment have already re-enlisted, and others will follow their patriotic example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>This regiment has done good service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It is desired to have its ranks swelled to <num value="1200">1,200</num> effective war men, and it is for you to say whether this shall he done by voluntary enlistment or by draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>I cannot believe you will await the latter after native. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/> Before the commencement of this unholy war upon us, many good patriots differed us to the proper course in be pursued for the protection of our liberties and our rights but the <rs>Northern Government</rs> and people have long since swept away all possible ground of difference among Southern men who desire to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>The questions which once separated us in opinion no longer exists, and those who were formerly Union men in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have the greatest cause for irreconcilable hostility to the <rs>Northern</rs> traitors who sought to entrap them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Without referring to the long train or usurpations and enormities committed by our enemies, it is only necessary to state their present position in regard to us. Under the pretence of restoring the <rs>Union</rs> they are seeking to dismember <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; with professions of devotion to the <rs>Constitution</rs> they propose to convert the <rs>Southern States</rs> into dependent Territories, and to confiscate the property of the citizens of these State for the payment of the enormous debt they have contracted, and the reward of the mercenary soldiers they have sent against us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> The struggle on our part is for existence itself, and the question is, whether the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> shall remain free, self governing communities, or become Territorial appendages of an odious Northern despotism, ruled by Northern Governors, and overrun by Northern tax-gatherers and each <unclear> ators.</unclear> In this struggle we will most assuredly prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>The duration of the struggle, however, and the amount of suffering consequent on it, will depend on the promptness with which the people will respond to the call of the <rs>Government</rs> for troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>To stand all of in this struggle is to give aid and comfort to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>his calculations now are, that the terms of many of our soldiers will shortly expire, and their places will not be filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>This army will respond nobly to the call made upon it, but circumstances of the most urgent necessity will impel some in its ranks to retire for a time at the expiration of their present terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Will you not take their places?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Is there <num value="1">one</num> among you who dare look forward to the period in after years, when &mdash; this war having come to a successful issue, and peace and prosperity smiling upon a happy land &mdash; he will be compelled to confess to his own children, that he remained an inactive spectator of this greatest of our wars for independence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>If there is, whatever his professed faith, let him not murmur if the name of tory shall stick to him like the shirt of <persName n="Nessus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00610" reg="mostcommon:Nessus,nomatch:0"><surname>Nessus</surname></persName> through all his life.
