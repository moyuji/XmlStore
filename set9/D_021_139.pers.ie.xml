<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> On yesterday morning, beneath the warm garb of the <name>Sabbath</name> sunshine, while yourself and other friends in the city were no doubt quietly perverting your Sabbath ablutions, this skirmish took place, and inasmuch as military men here think it was creditable to as, I give you the facts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> A detail of <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> men, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="5TXRegiment">5th Texas regiments</orgName>, was made on the morning, <hi rend="italics">not to <unclear></unclear></hi>--that's not our style &mdash; but for the purpose of securing the woods in front of our line on the<placeName reg="9mile road">Nine-mile road</placeName>, seeing what <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force there way in the woods, and to drive them out if possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> We found the enemy posted in the woods a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> from our front line of pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>After reconnoitering, we discovered a strong force of the enemy's whole brigade, it was supposed &mdash; to the left of the wood, and a large force, then unknown, immediately in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The force on the left were silent, calculating that they had a dead thing on us, while those in front were bold and impudent, keeping up a constant fire at us from among the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We let them amuse themselves for a while in this manner, occasionally silencing <num value="1">one</num> as he became too annoying, until our line was fully established and safeguards placed against our friends on the left of the road. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>they fired but <num value="1">one</num> volley and took to their heels, our boys following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We pursued them out of the timber, under cover of their batteries, when they took refuge in their trenches, and fired back at us. Here we had a comrade killed; but regardless of the fierce fire poured upon them, <num value="4">four</num> men bore him on their shoulders out of the field back to our camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> In the mean while our friends on the left of the road attempted to succor their companions and to &#x0022;suck us in&#x0022; They started to come in our rear, but a small &#x0022;family battery&#x0022; we had in the right place opened on them and deterred them from their purpose.&#x0022; <num value="1">One</num> well aimed shell fell in their midst, killing <num value="7">seven</num> and wounding a number. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> From correspondence submitted for <unclear></unclear> we made the following extracts, containing interesting incidents of the late battle on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> I cannot forget <num value="1">one</num> <unclear></unclear> however, for it will ever remain <unclear></unclear> on my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Passing the redoubts at the close of the fight, on the fight, I had assisted in the removal of <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> several wounded to sitting postures against a large wood pile, so that they might be near the camp fires, and out of range should the enemy open again upon us farther down the road; and knowing not precisely how to occupy my time, wandered into the long streets of the deserted camps, musing upon the events of the day, and hoping to find sundry articles of kit and camp equipage, which, as a soldier, then much needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>In haste and <unclear></unclear>, I approached a field officer's tent, and as I held the tent doorway my left hand, locked in, and, to my horror and amazement, beheld the floor covered with dead and mangled corpses, staring and grinning at me to the most distorted, and fearful manner!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Some were sitting, some full length on the floor, others twisted and turned, as if they had expired in fearful agonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Such a sight I never beheld on any field before, and sincerely hope I may never see again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/><num value="1">One</num> was armless, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> had lost a leg, the face of <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> was an undistinguished able mass of blood and laceration, while the rest of a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> hung by mere shreds of fibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>In scores of tents it was the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>In whichever <num value="1">one</num> I looked there lay some dead man, ghastly, bloody, and cord!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>In <num value="1">one</num> tent fine china ware was laid, as it for dinner; at a fire near by was coup and other tempting edibles, camp stools were drawn near to the table, and everything betokened preparations for a meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Swords, caps, camp beds, clothing, &#x0026;c., were found lying about in profusion, and everything showed the feet that the enemy had vacated the premises hastily and unprepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Camp equipage of all kinds was plentiful, and proved of incalculable value to our poorly-furnished soldiery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> Yet who shall describe or attempt to paint the horrors of this scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Here are wounded Federals moaning piteously and craving water from every passer by, and as they crawl through the rend and mire, knowing not whither, or for why, the hardest heart sickens at the sight and involuntarily turns away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Yet how cheerful are our wounded!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>How they smile and joke at the slightest kindness and attention, looking as happy as if they had participated in some wedding feast rather than powder begrimed and gory soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The contrast was decidedly marked in this respect, and was noticed by many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Few complaints were heard, any or the slightest attention met with in <unclear></unclear> and their sole thought seemed to be the fortunes of the day, and the honor they felt in having borne a noble part therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>I saw old men and boys tottering along the roads with wounded limbs, uncomplaining in feed, and all anxiety for the fate of the day. <num value="1">One</num> old man, (an Irishman, upwards of <measure n="50years" type="date">50 years</measure>,) passed me on the road, with a fearful gash in his cheek, and, in answer to interrogatories, blushed as he said, &#x0022;In faith, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, it's only a scratch, sure, and if I only had the ball out of my cheek, I'd go back to help the boys again, for I'm ashamed to see the doctor, as long as I can stand (!)&#x0022; The old man passed, and we stood astonished at his fortitude and heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Standing under a tree by the roadside, and intently watching the wounded pass, was an old gentleman in black, with long silvery heir, and ministerial in deportment. &#x0022;Have you seen my son, sir?&#x0022; asked he beseechingly, &#x0022;his name is--, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA11">11th Virginia</orgName>--tell me how they have fared, and whether any remain.&#x0022; Pitying this good old man from the bottom of my heart, I concocted a plausible story on the instant, half fiction, half truth, regarding his son's regiment, which giving bright hopes to the old man, his countenance brightened, his statue assumed its full proportions, and striking the ground with his cane, he exclaimed, with a burst of emotion--&#x0022;Dead or alive, then, sir, of such was their conduct before the enemy, I am proud of my son, and feel an honored man. I knew my child would never disgrace his father and his native State!&#x0022;--The nearer the field the more numerous the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Stretcher bearers were alienly moving through the brush with some poor wounded fellow, but physicians there were few, so far as I could discern, upon the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Sitting near the redoubt, and around a pleasant fire, were some dozen or more of soldiers; they had found whiskey in the enemy's tents, and were jocular and merry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>At the moment of my visit, however, they had made pots of coffee from deserted stores, and were enjoying their <persName n="Rio,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Rio,nomatch:0"><surname>Rio</surname></persName> with great gusto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Appealing to them, however, on behalf of the wounded, several of the halt and lame immediately left their log seats and, <rs n="coffee pot" type="product">coffee-pot</rs> in hand, sallied forth with me in search of the wounded scattered around, and, whether friend, <unclear> </unclear> viands prepared <unclear></unclear> give them <unclear></unclear> by times, indeed, have I seen wounded of ours moving about painfully to sand from assisting in caring for the wounded, utterly regardless of self, and all intent upon these <unclear></unclear> of mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Shot and shell, indeed, were falling thick and fast to the left of us, yet none for an instant doubted ultimate success, but looked upon the defeat of the enemy as a foregone conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Some few stragglers had secured spoils, but very few. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> Passing <num value="1">one</num> of the vacated tents, I heard the ripping of cloth, and looking in saw a Confederate--at least a mile from our main position &mdash; charitably engaged in acting as surgeon to a wounded Federal, and was binding up his leg &mdash; soliloquizing as he did so, &#x0022;darn you; what the devil brought you here, anyhow?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>You ought to have known we should whip you, and all the time whenever you come out in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Darn you, why <sic>did'nt </sic> you stay at home and let the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> alone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>I think you have got enough of it this time, boss, and advise you never to come down here again.&#x0022; The poor wounded Federal said nothing, but groaned piteously, and thanked the rough, but kindhearted, Georgian, and I passed on. But the most harrowing and heartrending sight witnessed on that day occurred towards evening, on the railroad, and near town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Quite a youth, a soldier, being wounded early in the action, had manfully undertaken to walk to town, but loss of blood and fatigue was too much for him, and he had fainted on the way. A good lady, (whose son, perhaps, was in the fight,) all anxiety to learn the news, had walked some distance upon the track, and discovering the fainting youth, sat by the roadside and bathed the temples of the <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinian</rs> boy, weeping as she did no, and unconsciously speaking of her hopes and fears.--The wounded youth was for some time utterly unconscious of these and attentions, but when his arm had been bound up, and temples bathed, and his eyes opened, he looked into the face of the good lady with mute, yet eloquent meaning, his lips moved, but that was all &mdash; he wept, and so did his nurse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Strangers to each other &mdash; yet mother and son they truly were, both in instinct and every feeling. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<head>The fall of New Orleans.</head> <byline>[From the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London Times</orgName>, <date value="05-13">May 13.</date>]</byline> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The spirit in which the fall of New Orleans has been met by the <rs>Southern Press</rs> is <num value="1">one</num> of fierce defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The great fact seems to be that <num value="13">thirteen</num> gunboats have succeeded in getting up the river to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>When this had happened the rest was a matter of course.--<persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="mostcommon:Lovell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName> and his garrison could not get at these gunboats; but the gunboats could get at <persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00393" reg="mostcommon:Lovell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName>, and, moreover, could set the city on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>The foreign vessels of war upon the spot very naturally protested against the exercise of this latter power, and <persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00394" reg="mostcommon:Lovell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName>, and his garrison went forth from a position in which they could be of no further use. New Orleans would, no doubt, have capitulated or surrendered, or have done anything which was necessary to be done, in order to a void being shelled, but there was no <num value="1">one</num> to take possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>The angry citizens profess to hope that some of their own gunboats may come down and relieve them from the <num value="13">thirteen</num> small furies that hold them in such deadly terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>But the simple truth is that New Orleans has allowed itself to be placed at the mercy of the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>It has always been a city of &#x0022;rowdies,&#x0022; and with such persons bluster is too apt to take the place of valorous deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>It is now in the position of waiting for the arrival of a hostile garrison, in order that it may surrender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/> If words in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> always represented facts, the fall of this city would be of no more importance than the fall of any common fort upon the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The Southern press is completely of this opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>It most clearly perceives how the fact is capable of being made an advantage rather than a blow to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>It is, they say, a great <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> released from an awkward and indefensible position; it is a Federal army shut up in prison, where it must melt away from yellow-fever; it is a city, useless because blockaded, removed from the catalogue of Confederate embarrassments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>It we might judge from the slackness with which the city has been defended, we might give some credence to the affected complacency with which they contemplate its loss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/> But it cannot be a pleasant thing to lose the commercial capital of the <rs>South</rs>, and still less to lose it in this inglorious manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>It is in vain to deny that the possession of New Orleans is such a loss to the <rs>South</rs> that, if that city could be maintained by the <rs>Federal</rs> power or an indefinite time, the <rs>South</rs> itself, great as it is, must pine, and dwindle, and go back to its natural state of forest and swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>It is vain to say that a force holding that city, and supreme wherever a boat can swim, cannot spread devastation far abroad, and ruin all the classes which depend upon profits derived from without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>To do the <name>Southerners</name> justice, they appear inclined, at least tacitly to admit a great part of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>But they say they accept the sacrifice for the moment, and deny the <rs>Federal</rs> power to continue the pressure beyond a brief <sic>stace.</sic> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>They say that successive garrisons will occupy the city, and in certain succession be deposited in its cemeteries, and that reinforcements of sailors will come only to follow their comrades to a sailor's burial in the waters of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>They say that, penetrate where they may, the invaders will be regarded as buccaneers and brigands, who may hill and plunder where they go, but behind whom a hostile population will always close up, shooting down their stragglers, harassing their communications, cutting their telegraph wires, and watching every opportunity for their destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>They point already to &#x0022;immense quantities&#x0022; of cotton and tobacco burnt, and to the partial execution of a general plan to this effect long since formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Their weakness, they say &mdash; and they truly say &mdash; extends only to a cannon shot distance from the sea, or a lake, or a navigable river, and they point to a million of square miles which are not thus dominated, and ask how it is possible that these can be subdued? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/> Much of this is very true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>But the question remains whether the <name>Southerners</name> have the constancy to endure these terrible sufferings rather than give in. If they have, and of course, they never can be conquered.--There are histories without end of natures deserting their sea- coasts, leaving their <unclear></unclear> plains, retiring from their rivers, holding their own in their mountains, and retaining their independence at last; and, if the <name>Southerners</name> have but the endurance of which it would be easy to cite a <num value="100">hundred</num> instances, they may well laugh the idea of subjugation to scorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>But they have sometimes talked so loudly and acted so feebly &mdash; as in this case of Now <placeName reg="Orleans, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050361">Orleans</placeName> &mdash; that we are not certain that words really do mean fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>It is impossible to deny what the <rs>Southern</rs> press says &mdash; that they have a great front of battle still unsure on.
