<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>This is a judicious and wise decision </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> I must allude to a policy inaugurated in the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 33" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> which has the tendency, it <unclear></unclear> by interested functionaries, to operate unjustfy towards worthy and competent men. All measures in which the public are interested should be freely discussed and as freely commented upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If the vacancies to descreated in the various <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> regiments are to be filled by men who have not only received a strictly military education, but who is known to be men of experience, of sound judgement, and competent to discharge the duties of such positions, perhaps it might be viewed as hypercritical to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But even in this case, it is a hard measure to move competent men who have borne the heat and burden of the day in expending their efforts to raise and organize companies, and then to be displaced from positions for which they have been acknowledged as qualified But it becomes doubly grievous when they are displaced by appointees who stand in the same relation to a military education as they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But why remove the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is influentially questioning their ability, though in such cases it is simply making way for some favorite or friend, or friend's friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I learn that the officers of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">3d Regiment</orgName> of Volunteers raised in this city and vicinity, are to be superceded from the present <rs>Colonel</rs>, who has always manitested a lively interest in it from its origin down to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> There seems to be reflection taking the place of fierce passions and devilish hate in some portions of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Infuriate vows of provincial subjugation and ultimate extermination, seem to be giving place to the sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought, which suggests that prudence in the better part of valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We hear that it was not in the programme of some of the <rs>Northern</rs> <sic>velunteer</sic> horde to invade the <rs>South</rs>, but simply to protect the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, for which purpose enlistments were avowedly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>No such wild and impracticable and scandal scheme as Southern subjug?tion and determination entered into the views of the ennibugged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The fact is, the determination of the <rs>South</rs>, and the united front it presents, together with the enthusiasm of the whole people, begin to open the eyes of men who have deluded and suffered themselves to be kindly led by the black demagegues of the <rs>North</rs> to effect an object, which has not truth or justice for its basis. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>This may perhaps account for the appearance of a Richmond correspondence in the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York Herald</orgName> and <orgName n="Washington Star" type="newspaper">Washington Star</orgName>;&#x0022;</q> and in <num value="1">one</num> of the editorials it is suggested that <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00275" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Pompey,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> receives his information in regard to the position of affaire in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 33" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00276" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> through the same medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>As these remarks unanswered may be the means of casting suspicion where it is not deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>I consider it due to the officers of this Company to say that every package offered to them by any person who is supposed to be unfriendly to the <rs>South</rs> is rejected; and during the brief period of the late interraption of the mails, aithough hundreds of letters were brought to this office to be sent to Northers cities, none were sent, unless the parties offering them were well known to us, and as much as possible those were limited to persons who had claims on us from their business transactions through our Express, and in no instance was a letter allowed to be sent if the party sending was not known to us as occupying a proper position towards the <rs>Southern States</rs>, unless they would allow the letter to be read in our office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>And in all cases we required them to be enclosed in Government stamped envelopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The copies of our way-bills, containing lists of the directions of every package and letter sent through the <rs>Express</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>can be seen at our office, and we invite the examination, by any person properly authorized to make the request, to look for the name of any person which could arouse the suspicion of the most excitable Southerner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> In conclusion I have to say that this office is filled by men born and raised in the <rs>South</rs> and if not prominent and noisy in their demonstrations of loyalty to its institutions, it is only because they have thought more of <hi rend="italics">acting</hi> upon such feelings and principles than of calling attention to a new-born zeal in their defense. </p> <closer> <salute>Respectfully your obedient servant.</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Gibson,,J.,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="default:Gibson,J.,F.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName>  <surname>Gibson</surname></persName>,</signed> my <num value="18">18</num>--1t Agt. <orgName n="Adams Express Co" type="company">Adams Express Co</orgName>. </closer> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>
