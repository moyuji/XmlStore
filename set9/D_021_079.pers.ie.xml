<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>As a financial question, it possessed no merit, at least so far as the present is concerned, and it was not contended by its advocates that any benefit in that respect would be derived from its passage.--It was supposed, however, by those who favored it, that the policy recommended might have its effect in propitiating the public sentiment of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Powers, a sentiment which is as much regarded in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> as in the <rs>United</rs> or Confederate State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/><measure n="3weeks" type="date">Three weeks</measure> ago we were well fixed at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, when late <num value="1">one</num> evening we got orders from our noble old <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00604" reg="nearbymention:Price,Sterling,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName> to send <num value="1">one</num> baggage down to <persName n="Walson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00605" reg="mostcommon:Walson,nomatch:0"><surname>Walson</surname></persName>'s <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> battle ground, and all the men report in the town of <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, to meet the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>The enemy in powerful force attacking every few hours our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, and amidst the booming of artillery and rattling ot small arms <hi rend="italics">we sullenly</hi> marched on, <hi rend="italics">hoping</hi> every moment that the order would be given to turn and <hi rend="italics">meet them, </hi> our insolent foe.--Thus through bitter cold nights and sleepless days did we march on, the enemy every moment trying to outflank us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>At last, when they found that we were about to escape them in the mountains of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, did they resolve upon something desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>Sending forward <num value="2500">2,500</num> brag cavalry, they made, with <num value="4">four</num> pieces of artillery, a dash upon our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>; but nobly were they met, as <num value="122">one hundred and twenty-two</num> graves at Sugar <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, in this State, can attest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/> Will you allow me to use your journal as a medium through which to call the attention of the ladies of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 10" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to some of the evils which our soldiers are subject to, and which, I believe may be greatly alleviated? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, with respect to clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Last <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs> the ladies throughout the entire country were actively employed preparing garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>What was necessary then is so now, and will be every <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs> while the war lasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>We must not become weary and indifferent because the novelty is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>The necessity is as great, if not greater, than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>We must be earnest, energetic, and unceasing in our efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>There is a great work to be done, from which no <num value="1">one</num> has a right to exempt herself, and in which all can take a part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Those who have no money to give, have time; let them bestow that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>That the <rs>Government</rs> provides clothes, I know; but it does not provide all that are requisite, and there are many in our army who are unable to purchase the additional articles required for comfort and health, at the present shameful and unheard of prices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/> What I would propose is, that the ladies of this city form an association for the purpose of furnishing garm ents to the soldier at a price within reach of his means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>To do this let us raise a fund for the purchase of material suitable for under garments, out them out and give them to be made, paying proper prices, receiving any gratuitous aid which may be offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>When we have a sufficient number of garments prepared, open a depot from which the soldier can supply himself, charging only what the material and making costs us. This will considerably reduce the price now paid for the same article, even when procured from the <rs type="place">Government stores</rs>; for they have not only to charge the cost of material and making, but the profit of the contractor also, which is very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>We can, moreover, receive orders from companies to provide what they may need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>If the ladies will do this, they will be performing a noble and useful work, and conferring an unspeakable been on the soldier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/> The other matter I would bring to their notice is the want of accommodation for such of our soldiers as are detained here on their way to and from their regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>They arrive here daily, weary, travel-stained, and hungry, after long marches through muddy roads, or the scarcely less fatiguing transportation in crowded box-cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>When they reach this city there is no place for them to rest, no food prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>[The only place of the kind, the <rs>St. Charles</rs>, is very far from what it should be in every respect.

<head>&#x0022;a Tack in time.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/> Some <num value="1">one</num> tells a characteristic story of an English gentleman, traveling some years ago in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, who took a hammer and tacks with him, because he found dog's-eared carpets at all the inns where he rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Atone of these inns he tacked down the carpet, which, as usual was loose near the door, and soon afterwards rang for his dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>While the carpet was loose, the door could not be opened without a hard push; so when the waiter came up he just unlatched the door, and then going back a couple of yards, he rushed against it, as was his habit with a sudden spring to force it open; but the wrinkles of the carpet were no longer there to stop it, and not meeting with the expected resistance, the unfortunate waiter fell full sprawl into the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>It had never entered his head that so much trouble might be saved by means of a hammer and half a dozen tacks, until his fall taught him that make shift is a very unprofitable kind of shift. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/> The anecdote enforces some very admirable hints on immediate repairs, which do almost as much towards keeping up the good looks of a house as the stated yearly cleaning to which we devoted a paragraph last month. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/> &#x0022;If the corner of a carpet gets loose and prevents the door opening, or trips every <num value="1">one</num> up that enters the room, nail it down at once. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/> A dog's eared carpet marks the sloven as well as the dog's eared book. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/> &#x0022;If a ring should come off the <rs n="window curtains" type="product">window curtains</rs>, or bad curtains, or off the blinds, or the binding get loose, or the lines broken, let the repair be made immediately after it is discovered; for if neglected, the damage speedily becomes worse and the mending more troublesome. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/> &#x0022;It is no uncommon accident for the tie of a cushion or mattress to break; and if this be not repleced at once, the stuffing soon gets up in a heap, as inconvenient as it is unsightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>With a mattress-needle <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> long, a yard of twine, and a piece of leather to insert under the tie, this repair can easily be made &mdash; there is no difficulty about it; and in every thrifty household such a needle should be kept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>A bent needle is also useful for darning holes in a rug or carpet while lying on a flat surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>A small gine-pot, too, is a desirable article; corners get knocked, off the furniture; now and then the venear cracks and rise, or a rail splits; and if not mended forthwith, the article soon gets shabby, receives its usage, and is thrown aside as worthless; but with a little glue, which may be melted in a few minutes, the defect may be repaired without delay, and further mischief prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>Care should be taken to have the glue not thicker than cream, and always quite hot when used. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/> We call especial attention to this important branch of housekeeping, because we have seen so many homes and people made uncomfortable by its neglect, and all without knowing what hurt them,&#x0022; sensible of their own annoyance and the growing shabbiness around them, but not of its cause. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
