He further states that the acceptances which he did return were those which had matured in his own pocket and could not, therefore, be negotiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The probability is that when the acceptances were returned to <persName n="Floyd,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> by <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="nearbymention:Russell,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, he accepted others at the same time for the same amount, of which there was no registry made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>It is deemed safest to proceed upon supposition that the acceptances made in the place of those returned were registered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Upon this hypothesis, the <measure n="840000dollars" type="currency">$840,000</measure> must be deducted from the <measure n="6179395dollars" type="currency">$6,179,395</measure> of the unconditional acceptances made and registered in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>This would leave them, so far as is shown by the records of that Department, <measure n="5339395dollars" type="currency">$5,339,395</measure> still in circulation; add to this amount the <measure n="798000dollars" type="currency">$798,000</measure> of conditional acceptances received by <persName n="Bailey,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Bailey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bailey</surname></persName> in lieu of the bonds, and the aggregate is <measure n="6137395dollars" type="currency">$6,137,395</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/> We propose to present to the reader some views of the national troubles, in all candor and fairness, and with respect to reason and truth, detached from any excitement or prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>We ask for them a liberal examination: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> I.--the <rs>Union</rs> as it is. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> It is plain that there has been a great alienation of feeling between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>; an alienation growing out of education, religion and polities of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>For <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> it has been growing, until it has culminated in the triumph of a purely sectional party, on the merit of hostility to the <rs>South</rs>, and the opinion that Southern civilization is barbarism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>At the beginning of the crusade, the <name>Fathers</name> of the <rs>Republic</rs> were terrified at its threatening aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName></hi> said it struck him like the fire-bell at night, and filled his mind with dread for the fate of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Yet the tide swept on, and, after repeated convulsions, the great <rs>Kentucky</rs>, or, rather, <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> orator, was again compelled to throw himself into the breach <measure n="11years" type="date">eleven years</measure> ago, and his last signal achievement was again to preserve his country from the gulf of dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>He declared then that it could not survive this continued agitation, and he indulged the delusive hope that it was then finally at rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The fiend did not rest, however, and in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> won his great victory and seized the reins of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>His march has been steady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Born in a land where so recently slavery existed &mdash; in a land where the ocean slave trade was followed, and for whose benefit that trade was protected in the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; in a land which abolished slavery because it was not profitable &mdash; in a land which found the <rs>South</rs> a ready outlet for the slaves they wanted to get rid of &mdash; the fiend raises the war cry against those who purchased these slaves, and swears that he will build a wall around them, so that they shall have no outlet, and that slavery shall go on amongst them to ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>In the progress of radicalism to this point it has broken <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the bonds of union in the hearts of the people, and we have the anomaly of a government really surviving the union of which it was the creature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>Long ago the <num value="2">two</num> great churches which underlie the foundation of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> dissolved the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The man of the <rs>North</rs> said I will not dishonor myself by sitting at the communion of the <rs>Lord</rs>'s table with the man of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The Union is dissolved in Congress, and has been for years &mdash; each side going to itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>It is dissolved in the hotels and boarding-houses of the <rs>Federal</rs> city, each side going off apart to itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>It is dissolved in the schools, nay, everywhere, save in <num value="3">three</num> of our churches.--The Government itself has no force in <num value="7">seven</num> of the most important States of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/> The greatest men of the country predicted that the <rs>Union</rs> would be dissolved by this sectional crusade, if it were not stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi>, without speaking especially of slavery, so predicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>He knew what sectionalism was in the army, and what it would be in the political arena; and he based his prophecy on what he supposed would be the spirit of independence and honor of a people who would brook no usurpation, no tyranny, no sectional appropriation of the powers of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Finally, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fillmore,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00385" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fillmore</surname></persName></hi> predicted the destruction of the <rs>Government</rs> from the same cause &mdash; when a party like that which elected <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00386" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,R.,T.,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> triumphed he said the <rs>South</rs> would not submit, and he declared that were the <rs>South</rs> so to triumph the <rs>North</rs> never would submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>His immense audience on the occasion, at <placeName reg="Rochester, Monroe, New York" key="tgn,7014348">Rochester</placeName>, unanimously re-echoed the sentiment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Is the <rs>Union</rs> <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Affection?</hi> If not, it must soon be <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Force;</hi> of force exerted by the superior over the weaker part; and it would certainly be best for the latter to escape that fate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/> An Union thus fallen away in the public heart, can never be permanently restored but by a revolution in that heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>With the most complete guarantees, while that sentiment of reciprocal kind feeling, sympathy and fraternal affection, which framed the original compact, is wanting, our Union must be deceitful and unreliable, and subject to constant discord and convulsion in all its interests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/> Unless this can be accomplished the rational <rs>Laquey</rs> which has suggested itself to so many patriotic minds, presents itself to all: Would it not be better peaceably to separate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>There would be <num value="2">two</num> great Confederacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>They could command the respect of the world.--They could adopt liberal treaties of commerce and internal navigation, and also an alliance offensive and defensive, for mutual protection from foreign enemies, and this would perpetuate the only overruling advantage which led to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of <date value="1783">1783.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/><num value="2">II</num>.--restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/> If the <rs>Union</rs> can be restored upon the proper grounds, however, it ought to be tried once more in spite of our doubts &mdash; i. e., if the whole Union can be so restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Though such a restoration would not revolutionize the public mind at once; in course of time, from the restrictions placed on sectionalism, and the withdrawing of slavery from the political arena of the <rs>North</rs> as much as possible, it is not beyond the reach of probability that we may get on harmoniously for a long time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> These remedies should settle the question of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and since the power in both branches of Congress is now largely in the hands of the free States, there should be certain guarantees of participation by the <rs>South</rs> in the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive Department</orgName>, and certain means of protection for the chief tax-bearing part of the <rs>Union</rs> from extravagant expenditures and exorbitant taxation by the tax levying majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>[See grand Congressional schemes of Pacific Railways and heavy Tariffs, which must fall with more force on <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> than any other State.] With these remedies we need care nothing about Personal Liberty bills, save so far as they are exponents of Northern public sentiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/> But even with these remedies, we should not shut our eyes to dangers against which we must, if possible, guard ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>There would be cause to distrust that Union with a superior division whose greatest motive is interest, and not respect for the people they desire to continue united with, and which has so unanimously avowed the doctrine and obligation of coercing seceding States, and who feel under such solemn conviction of conscientious duty to make the seceders pay taxes. --Anon, may we not apprehend the intervention of Emigrant Aid Societies to forestall Southern people in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> south of <num value="3630">36,30</num>, and a renewal of the bloody scenes of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and their agitating influences on the nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/> Nevertheless, if the <rs>Union</rs> can be entirely restored upon the basis laid down, it ought, for the sake of past history, and for the hope <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> of the possible reformation in the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, to be tried. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/> <num value="3">III</num>.--can the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> be Brought back! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/> The <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is organized for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. That is a fixed fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>At its head stand public men &mdash; in the centre of whom is that <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="smallcaps">Bright Saladin of the <rs>South</rs>,</hi>&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00391" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName></hi>--who are powerful in intellect, strong in resolution, and the man who expects child's play from them will be most woefully disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>That Confederacy embraces the most important staple-growing States in the late Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>The foreign trade with them is more to be sought for than that of all the balance of the <name>States</name> together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Therefore, their independence will be promptly recognized by powerful foreign nations; and a new course of trade will commence with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Atlantic seaboard and <persName n="Gulf,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="mostcommon:Gulf,nomatch:0"><surname>Gulf</surname></persName> utterly revolutionizing that heretofore existing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/> Will it be an easy matter to break up such a Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>to abolish such alliances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>If the people who compose it are unwilling, what excuse will there be to attack them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>They declare a desire to settle all questions of property with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> upon the most just and equitable footing --they have forbidden the slave trade &mdash; they will allow the most unrestricted navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> &mdash; and evince a fairness and frankness which should elicit admiration rather than a revengeful spirit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/> There are reasons to suppose that they will not be willing to come back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>They have been the objects of obloquy and denunciation in the <rs>Congress</rs> and the whole <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>Their prominent men have been threatened with a talon's death, and the wrath and power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and of every Northern State have been held in readiness to burst upon them with all possible ferocity and ruthlessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>How would a people so treated move amongst their denouncers, under a restoration of old relations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Would a truce between them be candid, sincere and cordial?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>These are matters which the members of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will no doubt fully canvass in their own minds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/> <num value="4">IV</num>.--the <rs>Central Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/> The proposition of a Central Confederacy in the event of a failure to restore the <rs>Union</rs>, is an impracticable idea and can only result in tieing the border slave States to the <rs>North</rs> as members of an Union in which they will be utterly overpowered and so insignificant as never to be felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Such a Confederacy, too, would be flanked by <num value="2">two</num> inferior powers who would be ever jealous, ever apprehensive of it, and who would seek alliances abroad to injure their more powerful neighbor and prejudice her commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>This would bring trouble on all. The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States would not hesitate to form an alliance with <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The border States would be in the meantime between upper and nether millstones &mdash; suspected by their Northern allies, hated by their Southern neighbors, and finally deprived of their own self-respect.--Indeed such an alliance on their part would be the signal for the exodus of their best people, causing the feebleness and desolation of a transition state, and would seal their destiny as mere tributaries to Northern affluence and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>How far superior would be the partition of the nation into <num value="2">two</num> great Republics on amicable relations with each other and with power to command the respect of the world and protect themselves! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/> But the <rs>Central Confederacy</rs> is an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Who has a right to slough off the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>And how can it be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It is an impossibility; and the idea of such a Confederacy is an easy way to the fastening of the border States to the car of the <rs>North</rs> as powerless captives, to be, as long as the <rs>Union</rs> with them lasts, the tributaries to their aggrandizement and the supernumeraries of their grand political drama. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>The Pittsburg Post gives the following particulars of that extraordinary case: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/> About <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, the residents not only of <placeName reg="Lawrenceville, Brunswick, Virginia" key="tgn,2112624">Lawrenceville</placeName>, but some in <placeName reg="West Branch Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,2758145">Alleghany</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburg</placeName>, were aroused by a terrible explosion, which seemed to be continuous and reverberative, lasting several seconds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>Investigation proved that the explosion originated from an infernal machine, which had been placed in the window-sill of a room in the lower part of <placeName><persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00706" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hoveler</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>The room contained <num value="2">two</num> beds, <num value="1">one</num> occupied by <persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00707" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hoveler</surname></persName> and wife, and the other (a trundle bed), by <num value="2">two</num> children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/><persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00708" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hoveler</surname></persName> had only retired about half an hour before, having been sitting at the window where the machine was placed awaiting the arrival of a physician, who had been sent for to minister to a member of the family then ill.--The occupants of the room were suddenly awakened by the shock, and found the room literally covered with fragments of glass and bullets, several of which were embedded in the wall, while the beds were also strewn with the leaden instruments of destruction.--A door opening in to another room gave vent to the charge, and permitted Mr. H. to remove his family from the suffocating atmosphere.-- By what seems an interposition of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, the design of the fiendish plotter against the lives of the innocent was frustrated, as none of the family were injured beyond a slight burn received by <num value="1">one</num> of the children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/> There is a porch in front of the house, and the window where the machine was placed opens upon the porch from a recess at the end. The machine evidently consisted (from the fragments picked up) of a box made of inch-thick pine, about a foot long, <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> wide, and the same depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>This was packed with powder and a number of bullets, (new, and of <num value="2">two</num> different sizes,) fastened up, and then bound securely with twine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>The firing was effected by a long fuse, which, after the box had been placed on the sill, was drawn along the railing of the porch, <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure>, and a match applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>The effect of the explosion of such a Satanic contrivance may be imagined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/> The <rs n="window glass" type="product">window glass</rs> and sash were shattered to atoms, and scattered over the rooms, while pictures and other small articles were torn to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>The burning twine set fire to the trees outside, and ignited the bed clothing inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>The room was filled with smoke and soot shaken from the chimney, and the explosion tore a shutter from its hinges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>In the morning <persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00709" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hoveler</surname></persName> picked up <num value="50">fifty</num> balls on the ground, and nearly as many in the room, and throughout the day persons visiting the scene found them all over the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>The box must have contained several <num value="100">hundred</num> balls, and it is indeed miraculous that no <num value="1">one</num> was injured by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>It is probable, however, that they were not so arranged in the casing as to give them full effect, and that the box was not strong enough to offer much resistance to the force of the explosion, thus permitting a large proportion of the missiles to fall outside, while those which entered the room fell with little force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>Marks of blood were observed upon the porch, and it is believed that the contriver of this fiendish projectile was himself injured by the explosion. </p> </div3>
