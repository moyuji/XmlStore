<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>That fair valley, with its gentle fields, its pleasant groves, and its broad stream, was soon enveloped in the dense fog of exploding shells, winding wreaths of smoke and white clouds from fort and earthworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Charge after charge was made by the enemy, and as boldly met by our men, now thoroughly desperate by reason of the crisis closing around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Every onset was repulsed, and as the ranks were mowed down they were filled up again and sent forward with new velocity.
