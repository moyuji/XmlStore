<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>A more monstrous falsehood was never published even in a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It contradicts itself, and is so plainly contradicted by subsequent events that it scarcely deserves the trouble of investigation; yet as there are persons among us who, though well meaning, are weak-hearted, and prone to believe the worst, if the loss of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was so great, how comes it that a single man of his army was allowed to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Why was it not pursued sword in hand, and either killed or captured by the innumerable cavalry which <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> had at hand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The rout of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Brabant, Wallonie" key="tgn,7008022">Waterloo</placeName> was the most completes recorded in modern history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Yet the <rs>French</rs> lost only <num value="29000">29,000</num> men--<num value="4000">4,000</num> less than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> affirm that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> lost in the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs>, while it is certain that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> did not carry <num value="120000">120,000</num> with him into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Like most habitual liars, these <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> prove too much.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army were not cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They did not follow <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> because they could not. They had been so badly beaten that pursuit was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The true loss of <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> did not probably reach <num value="12000">12,000</num> men, while their own as probably doubled that figure.--They were therefore in no condition to molest <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> in any movement he might choose to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We are sorry to see Confederate letter writers exaggerating our losses almost as much as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> We are at a loss to know what became of this functionary after the advent of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, which, we learn by a gentleman who saw the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num>, came from <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He seems to have cut no further figure &mdash; in a word, to have been quite chop fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He had previously declared that the constitutionality of the <name>Conscription</name> law should be tested by the <rs type="place">Courts</rs>, and the authority of the <rs type="place">Courts</rs>, whichever way they decided, maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The attempt to maintain this position would have brought him in direct conflict with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>; for, though the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName></orgName> has already decided that the law is unconstitutional, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is still determined to enforce the draft. --Has <persName n="Seymour,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><surname>Seymour</surname></persName>, then, backed out, and given up the ground to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>After using such determined language, when danger was at a distance, has he closed his mouth as soon as placed face to face with it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We will not willingly impute any unworthy act or motive of which he may be innocent to any man; but we hear nothing from <persName n="Seymour,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><surname>Seymour</surname></persName>, and now is the time for him to show his mettle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Now is the time to take the lion by the beard, if he ever means to do it. Now is the time for him to say whether or not there still be a Constitution in Yankeedom, and, if he cannot maintain it in its integrity, to gather up and stick by the fragments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The word will be much disappointed if, after all his bold talk, he should follow in the footsteps of <persName n="Baren,,John,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="expanded:Baren,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Baren</surname></persName> and other peace <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs> of that stripe. </p>

The draft is plainly unconstitutional, as anybody may see by reference to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is not only unconstitutional, but it is made, as if by design, most odiously oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is not wonderful that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> of New York should have decided it to be unconstitutional &mdash; that is, if the <rs>Judges</rs> know anything about the law they profess to interpret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But it will be considered especially wonderful if <persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> fail to do what he has been so long and so loudly threatening to do. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The law is sent amidst the clash of arms, and there is nothing for it but submission or death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The Conscription law, which is gathering in so many victims, is the harshest and vilest law of the kind that ever was enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>If it be necessary, for instance to draw <num value="20000">20,000</num> men from the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>, the <num value="20001" type="ordinal">20,000 first</num> drawn from the boxes are conscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But if they can raise <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> each, every man is discharged, and <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> fresh names drawn, to be discharged on the same terms.--The process goes on until it comes to a class who have no money, and no friends, and <hi rend="italics">they</hi> are sent to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The whole weight of the war, by this process is thrown upon the poor, who are usually the least able to stand it. It seems to have been invented especially to oppress the lower class and screen the rich. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> We had hoped, from the causes which led to this outbreak of popular discontent, and the parties which were most deeply implicated, that the great object would be defeated, and that the conscription could not be carried out. We were well aware that many insurrections occurred at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> during the earlier years of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <name>French</name> revolution, without in the slightest degree interfering with the conscription continually in operation, and that the <rs>Republic</rs> while torn by faction within never for a moment relaxed its system of aggressive warfare upon all its neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Yet, we conceived that there was no analogy between the <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure>. During the ascendancy of Robespierre, the insurrections were raised by the revolutionary clubs, which, in point of fact, constituted the <rs>Government</rs>, and directed against political enemies, or persons suspected of being such.
