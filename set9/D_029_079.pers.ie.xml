<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The State holds large amounts in the stocks of the various banks, the value of which can not be ascertained until the banks go into liquidation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He recommends that the banks of this State be required to go into liquidation <hi rend="italics">immediately,</hi> believing that the longer this is postponed the less the note-holder will receive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Several <num value="1000000">millions</num> invested in the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kanawha canal">Kanawha canal</placeName> will yield no revenue for years to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>For practical purposes, the <orgName n="Literary Fund" type="fund">Literary Fund</orgName> may be said to have ceased to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>On the subject of the payment of the late debt and taxation, the <rs>Governor</rs> offers several suggestions to the earnest consideration of the <name>Legislature</name>, but recommends no positive policy himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The Governor recommends a tax on oysters, and discusses the sole oyster question at great length and with such ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He further proposes that <num value="1">one</num> society of this tax be applied to the extinguishment of the <rs>State</rs> debt and the other to the support of the public schools. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The Governor recommends, with much deference, that the <rs>State</rs> interest in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Railroads</hi> be sold, as they are not sources of revenue to the <rs>State</rs>, nor likely soon to become so; whereas he thinks that private individual would make them pay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> He urges that the mode of collecting taxes calls for reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He points out faults of the old system, and suggests that the collection of the revenue be taken from the sheriffs, and <unclear></unclear> each <placeName reg="County Court">County Court</placeName> shall appoint a collector, to be paid <hi rend="italics">per diem,</hi> and endowed with power to <hi rend="italics">levy</hi> for payment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The mode of voting by ballot calls for reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A more perfect register of those entitle to vote should be kept. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> He also recommends that the duty of the <rs>State</rs> to educate all her children should be performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> needs a poly technic school for the education of her young men, and the <orgName n="Virginia Military Institute" type="institute">Virginia Military Institute</orgName> contains the elements to give it the proper direction. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The Governor thinks that very little legislation is required for the freedmen. &#x0022;A law should be passed requiring the clerk of each county to keep a book, in which, at the joint request of a negro man and woman who have heretofore been living as man and wife, he shall register their names and the date of their marriage.&#x0022; This should be considered lawful marriage, and legitimate the children of the parties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> He is at a loss what to suggest in regard to the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kanawha canal">Kanawha canal</placeName>. &#x0022;It has been a great expense to the <rs>State</rs>.&#x0022; &#x0022;He thinks there are too many salaried officers.&#x0022; Regards the crossing of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName> by the canal as impracticable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> He advocates a repeal of the usury laws, allowing the rate of interest to be fixed by the parties. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The Governor concludes by reviewing his policy in the matter of the reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He says he has made every exertion to restore to each man the rights of citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He <unclear>in </unclear> the <name>Legislature</name> to mark its action by <unclear>ad</unclear> liberal and enlightened patriotism, and <unclear></unclear> the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> on their deliberations. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Then follows a glowing tribute to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, calling especial attention to its powers of self-preservation. &#x0022;It has power to enforce the laws, punish treason, and insure domestic tranquillity;&#x0022; and &#x0022;the best security for the perpetual existence of the <name>States</name> is the supreme authority of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> &#x0022;The perpetuity of the <rs>Constitution</rs> brings with the perpetuity of the <name>States</name>; their mutual relation makes us what we are, and in <unclear></unclear> political system their connexion is indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The whole cannot exist without <unclear></unclear> nor the parts without the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>So long as the <rs>Constitution</rs> endures the <name>States</name> will endure; the destruction of the <num value="1">one</num> is the destruction of the other; the preservation of the <num value="1">one</num> is the preservation of the other.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> In laying down his policy, the <rs>President</rs> says that it has been his &#x0022;steadfast object to escape from the sway of momentary passions and to derive a healing policy from the fundamental principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.&#x0022; He gives with great power his reasons for appointing <rs type="role" reg="Provisional-Governor">Provisional Governors</rs> in the seceded States instead of establishing military governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They would have, he says, &#x0022;rather annoyed hatred than have restored affection,&#x0022; that it would have &#x0022;brought with it a train of men expecting profit from the miseries of their erring fellow-citizens,&#x0022; and that precise limit for their continuance was conceivable, endangering thereby the liberties of <unclear></unclear> loyal States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> Of the pardoning power, he says that he &#x0022;taken every precaution to connect it with the clearest recognition of the binding force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> laws,&#x0022; and the change in <unclear></unclear> to the existence of slavery. &#x0022;Every <unclear></unclear> must wish for a general amnesty at <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> the earliest epoch consistent with public safety.&#x0022; &#x0022;Treason of a flagrant character has been committed.&#x0022; &#x0022;Persons charged with its commission should have a fair and impartial trial in the <hi rend="italics">highest civil</hi> tribunals of the country. &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> As to the right of freedmen to suffrage, he favors leaving that to the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>To give them a right to vote in the <rs>Southern States</rs> would be to give them the same right in the <rs>Northern</rs>, and the <rs>Executive</rs> has no warrant for such measures in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He urges a dispassionate treatment of the subject, and desires a fair trial as to the ability of the <num value="2">two</num> races to live side by side, and advises against forced removal or colonization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> He refers to the vast natural wealth of the <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> States nearest the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, and predicts for them great prosperity, now that the monopoly of slave labor is removed, and calls for legislation that all monopolies be &#x0022;sternly guarded against.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He regrets to say that the propositions for an arbitrament of the questions between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> were declined by the latter, and an unsatisfactory proposition from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> declined by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He advises against an attempt to redress by legislation, but wishes to rest on the basis of friendship and mutual justice. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> The <hi rend="smallcaps"><orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>,</hi> which met a temporary suspension of its existence in the expiring names of the recent Confederacy, is this morning restored to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It is again endowed with the <name>Promethean</name> fire, and speaks to its readers as though it never lost its breath or its voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Welcome it, &#x0022;dear reader,&#x0022; with the same kind and genial sensibilities which warm its own heart, and let there be established once more between it and thee the same confidential and affectionate relations which formerly existed, and which blessed, and rewarded all its toil, all its struggles, through the thorny and flinty way of journalism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> These Southern States have passed through an ordeal of trial and suffering seldom the lot of a generation of people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>They entered upon a struggle, in which they failed, and in which these trials and sufferings were incurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Unlike most rebellions, as they are called, especially when they have failed, those who undertook it were not merely a set of malcontents, recklessly resisting the clearly-defined political organisms of the country; they were fortified by a sense of rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and a conscientious conviction of the justice of their position, which had at least the semblance of support in the debates of our ancestors, who framed the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself under which the <rs>Republic</rs> was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Those truly great men left the question of the relations between the <name>States</name> and the <rs>General Government</rs> an open <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>There were strong parties in the very convention which framed the compact of union upon the questions at issue touching those relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The very able and patriotic men who figured in that body, after much debate, gave the question the goby; and while they failed to settle it themselves, they appointed no umpire to which it could be referred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>They thus left us as a legacy a bitter and disastrous war &mdash; a war which was fought, and fought bravely, to its final conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The South entered upon it with more unanimity and determination than has been known to characterize the resisting party in any civil war that we read of. It fought through it, under its sense of constitutional right, with a courage and constancy which has challenged the admiration of other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>But the question thus submitted to the arbitrament of war, was decided against them, and they submitted, like brave men ever submit, to the fates, which all their fortitude and power cannot control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>They were overwhelmed by superior numbers and resources, and succumbed after a resistance which vindicated the honesty and sincerity of their intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Their heroism has lately received a tribute that is alike honorable to the head and heart of the magnanimous commander-in-chief of the powerful armies they encountered in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Such a tribute is the most fitting rebuke &mdash; the most scathing denunciation &mdash; of those wretched attempts to dishonor the gallant dead who fell in hecatombs on the field in proof of the truth and sincerity of their devotion to the cause <unclear></unclear> Regarding the result as the <unclear></unclear> the question, those who so nobly perilled their lives in support of the principles they espoused, readily acquiesced, and submitted to the authority of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and order and quiet were instantly restored, in a country where the devastations of war and the exhausting exertions of defence against overwhelming odds, had reduced the people nearly to famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The subsequent history we need not recount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The steady efforts of all the restore order, and the patient and cheerful manner in which a people reduced from the happiest independence to utter poverty, have undertaken to provide for immediate want and rebuild their fallen fortunes, constitutes <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest examples in the history of mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> In this struggle the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch</hi> took its part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>It was honest and earnest; and does not mean to retreat, or, in the every day parlance, to crawfish from its position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It sympathised with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, did all it could to cheer the hearts of the people in the struggle, and continued with it, and, we may say, fell with it in the calamitous fire of the <dateStruct value="-04-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Its voice was heard up to that hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>While the carrier conveyed its communications to the public in <num value="1">one</num> part of the city, its types and presses were melting in the fires of another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> But like the noble people in the midst of whom it was published, and who it now addresses, it, too, accepts the situation and the clear decision of the trial of arms &mdash; of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It means to abide by the oath which its conductors have taken, and sustain the <rs>Government</rs> under which we now live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>It feels, to-day, as though it had never been suspended &mdash; in fact, its seat at the round table of the fraternity has only been temporarily vacant &mdash; and it speaks as though only <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> had passed since its last appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It is true there is no war; but that was over, in fact, when it last appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It resumes its mission, then, before the war &mdash; which was to encourage and stimulate the improvement of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and assist in the development of the resources of our dear old mother, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>To these purposes it will bring all the energies of its improved and enlarged means and power; and hopes, in its day, to do some real service in this noble cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> Renewing our expressions of gratification at once more holding communication with our dear friends of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch</hi> promises at once to direct all its influence to the promotion of their good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Nothing on this earth would make its conductors <unclear></unclear> as to see our people safely and <unclear></unclear> through that trying transition state in which they are now struggling, and it shall be our most enthusiastic occupation to try to facilitate their passage, dry shod, through this <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">red sea</placeName> of their difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>That our own townsmen and the good people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless and preserve her!--may pass through their trials successfully, and become, is they deserve to be, prosperous and happy, <unclear></unclear> the devout prayer of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch.</hi> </p> </div3>

<head>Rebuilding the city.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> There is a great mistake prevailing with many people that all the money employed in rebuilding this city comes from the <rs>North</rs>, and very doleful prophecies are indulged upon this hypothesis concerning the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>We are sold!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>We are both bought and sold!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>and must wind up with general bankruptcy and poverty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Now, there is no use in this &mdash; no season for all this anticipation of evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>There a better and a truer view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The money employed in the active enterprise <unclear></unclear> rebuilding this city is not all from the forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Nearly all the very best buildings in progress of construction in this city are built on with the money of our own enterprising citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>For, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>notwithstanding <unclear></unclear> desolation which swept over the <rs>South</rs>, <unclear></unclear> especially over this devoted city, some of <unclear> </unclear> Wisest and most far-seeing of our people <unclear></unclear> a part of their means, and this they are <unclear></unclear> using in the most enterprising and public-spirited manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>So that we are not entirely dependent on Northern capital &mdash; very <unclear></unclear> from it. But what should we fear from <unclear></unclear> Northern capitalists?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We know that, commercially speaking, under the influence of <unclear></unclear> transportation, by water and rail <unclear></unclear> telegraphs, there is an inevitable concentration of commerce in the great cities and <unclear></unclear> points of the <name>Continent</name>, and that all <unclear></unclear> localities must be subsidiary and tributary <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> to them, So that, do what we will, we cannot escape that subordinate relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Now, since that is the case, what objection can we have to the drawing of capital from the commercial centre to build up and adorn our recently desolated and forlorn city?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Money put in the bricks, in the stores and dwellings and public edifices of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, cannot be easily taken away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>At most, the proprietorship of the buildings can only be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The money remains in the buildings, and they are permanent &mdash; permanent places of business, permanent tenements to live comfortably in, permanent ornaments of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Not only, therefore, are we fortunate in having this borrowed capital to revive the city; but our good fortune will be increased precisely to the extent of the amount that may be so contributed from abroad to this important object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> There need be no fears on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The more capital that is drawn thither, the greater the interest that will be felt by capitalists abroad in the general prosperity of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>They would be unwilling to see their investments wholly unproductive, and their influence and means would, if necessary, be surely given for the promotion of that general commercial thrift which would contribute to their individual benefit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> So let us look ahead and be hopeful, assured that every dollar brought here and placed in the houses of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, is a permanent investment, and a guarantee of the confidence felt in the future of the place, as well as an earnest of the disposition to aid in the promotion of its growth and welfare. </p> </div3>

<head>The usury laws.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Pierpont,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Pierpont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName>,</hi> in his annual message, recommends the repeal of the laws against usury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>If at any time the wisdom of putting a restriction upon the rate of interest upon money were doubtful, certainly at the present time, it should be generally conceded as entirely impolitic and productive of little else than injury to the interests of commerce and the general business of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Our people are striving to &#x0022;reconstruct&#x0022; their trade and rebuild their city; and <num value="1">one</num> of the most serious obstacles in their way is the difficulty of obtaining money for their enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>They have the best securities; but capitalists will not lend money at the legal rate of interest when they can readily get from <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num>; and they are unwilling to loan it at higher rates than the legal interest to persons residing here, where heavy penalties are prescribed for exacting more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>This State cannot isolate itself financially and commercially by ignoring the circumstances and the usages which surround it, and which prevail in communities with which its intercourse is constant and rapid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Her true policy is to recognise and conform to them by her legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>She will thus invite capital and untrammeled the energies of her people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> It is idle to say that our citizens cannot pay the same for the use of money that other people pay; and it is equally idle to expect them to get the use of money unless they do. There are those who will predict the utter ruin of all who pay more than that interest which this State has decided by its laws to be proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Many of those who entertain these views are <hi rend="italics">free trade</hi> men &mdash; men who contend that there should be no restriction upon trade; that men should buy where they can buy cheapest, and sell where they can sell dearest, and that everything <hi rend="italics">except money</hi> is worth what it will bring in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>And why except money?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Is not that as much the subject of the laws of supply and demand as anything else?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>There is, indeed, nothing more so; nothing whose value is so decidedly and suddenly affected by these causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Indeed, so inevitable is this, that the most rigid laws cannot prevent it. With all the vigilance and the rigor of our State in its measures to <hi rend="italics">compel the value of money to remain without alteration,</hi> (for if that be not the object, there is neither wisdom nor justice in usury laws,) it has changed just as rapidly and as frequently as if no law existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The effect has been to deprive its citizens of the use of money when it was worth more than <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num>: or to throw them into the power of a few capitalists, who did not scruple to violate the law, and who, besides the advantage which they had in having the field of shaving to themselves, put on additional charges to indemnify themselves for incurring the perils of the laws against their usury. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The State would be doing a wise thing for its citizens, and for the promotion of its own prosperity, by leaving the transactions in money to determine their own rate of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It would increase the capital employed here, and very much diminish the rate of interest which some people, by stress of circumstances, have to pay, by increasing the competition among capitalists for the purchase of good paper. </p> </div3>

<head>Fashion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> The Fashions for <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> are laid before the public by those industrious caterers to variety &mdash; the books of fashions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>They are not pretty in an artistic sense, and so we hope the ladies may think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The dresses are all profusely and vulgarly overloaded with trimming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Elegant and chaste simplicity is now considered <hi rend="italics">slow.</hi> Slow, too, in another sense, for not long ago the fashions changed less frequently &mdash; now it is once a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If the bonnet and cloak, the dress, the very crinoline itself, is to change in shape every month, where is the purse in this part of the world that can afford to dress a wife and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Where is the young man with the nerve or folly sufficient to brave the hazard of marrying <num value="1">one</num> of the votaries of fashion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> In all the cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and in the large cities in the <rs>North</rs>, the young men have formed clubs and societies, opposing by theory and practice the holy order of matrimony. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> The great expense of supporting a wife is the strong argument that they use. Of course, now and then these male vestals fall from grace and get married; but, for all that, the number of old maids is increasing enormously; and, ladies, we fear these clubs will be formed here, too, if the same causes exist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> And, after all, what is this fashion mania?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> There is something surpassingly tasteful, as well as suggestive, in this short sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The Governor is evidently a man of brilliant imagination, and knows how to express his conceptions. &#x0022;Liberty&#x0022; is here described, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as a fixed and immovable monument, deep- rooted in the earth, and rearing its head toward the clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>A man of dull fancy would have been satisfied with advising a sharp lookout upon this inappreciable treasure, if there can be any necessity for watching an object which is of itself eternally stationary, and therefore runs no risk of taking wings unto itself and fleeing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But the <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> genius of the <rs>Governor</rs> had no sooner planted Liberty than it uprooted her, and put her in motion, with the whole people of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> in full cry at her heels, like a pack of hounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>This beats any metamorphosis in <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Ovid, Clinton, Michigan" key="tgn,2052912">Ovid</placeName></hi> in the suddenness and startling character of the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The Governor, we venture to suggest, has mistaken his calling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>He is a <hi rend="italics">post,</hi> not a politician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>We like that hint about the &#x0022;grand idea. &#x0022; It is historical, almost classical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Many peoples and communities have &#x0022;pursued&#x0022; it before, from which we should infer that it is not quite so immortal as the <rs>Governor</rs> would have us believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It was, for instance, a monomania with the <rs n="Athenian" type="ethnic">Athenians</rs>, who illustrated it in their own way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>They beautifully illustrate the &#x0022;grand idea.&#x0022; They amount to this: that the <rs n="Athenian" type="ethnic">Athenians</rs> were the strongest, and were determined to exercise the &#x0022;largest liberty&#x0022; in the premises or, in other words, that &#x0022;Might made Right.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> The <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> pursued this &#x0022;grand idea&#x0022; &#x0022;bodily, watchfully, and with unfaltering purpose,&#x0022; for <measure n="800years" type="date">eight hundred years</measure>, during the course of which they conquered and enslaved all the countries that lie between <placeName reg="Cadiz, Harrison, Ohio" key="tgn,2078690">Cadiz</placeName> and the <name>Indus</name>.
