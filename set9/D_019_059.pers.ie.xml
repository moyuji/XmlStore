<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He read from the <name>Code</name> adopted by the <name>Legislature</name> of that Territory, entitled <q>&#x0022;an act to provide for the protection of property in slaves in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>.&#x0022;</q> It was, he said, a full, complete and perfect codification of all acts necessary for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> report makes a declaration of the existence of slavery in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, and recognizes the right to emigrate there with such property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Many persons, he thought, had misconstrued the proposition as regards the protection proposed to be furnished by law, and argued that nothing furnished so complete protection as the common law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In adopting that instrument, the question occurred as to how far slaves should count in the matter of representation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Southern politicians held that they should not be counted at all while the <rs>North</rs> thought they should be counted entire; and they compromised by taking <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They saw no necessity for changing the phrase in amending the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and he did not therefore think the propositions were obnoxious in that point of view. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> &#x0022;In my last annual report I urged the necessity of adopting some measure for the enlargement of the <name>Penitentiary</name>, so as to place it in a proper condition to meet the increasing demands upon it.--The results of the last year show that <sic>that</sic> recommendation was not premature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/><measure n="2.5years" type="date">Two years and a half</measure> ago the crowded condition of the prison was very much relieved by the employment of <num value="100">one hundred</num> of the negro convicts on the <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Then there were only <measure n="260" type="prisoners">260 prisoners</measure> remaining in the <name>Penitentiary</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Thus it will be seen, that in a prison containing only <num value="168">168</num> cells, all except <num value="2">two</num> of which were originally designed for the confinement of a single prisoner, there are now confined over <measure n="2" type="prisoners">two prisoners</measure> for every cell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>In many of the largest and best ventilated cells, there are now confined <num value="3">three</num>, and in some instances as many as <num value="4">four</num> prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> &#x0022;The enlargement of the <name>Penitentiary</name> is no longer a question of mere policy, but is now a subject of paramount necessity; and unless the <name>Legislature</name> shall so modify the criminal law of the <rs>State</rs> as to change the mode of punishment for minor felonies, or those sentenced for short terms of imprisonment, even the most active measures that can be adopted will scarcely relieve the pressing necessities of the prison during the approaching summer. </p>

We did not mean to deny his claims to rank with them, and yet the omission was not made through inadvertence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>We were thinking of the <rs>Divine Comedy</rs>, all the time, while we were writing the paragraph about the singular coincidence of fate between the <rs>Grecian</rs> and the <rs>English</rs> poet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>But we were calling attention to the loss of all knowledge with regard to the personal history of these <num value="2">two</num> great men. <num value="1">One</num> of them lived several centuries before the invention of writing, so far as it is possible to ascertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>There were, of course, no written contemporary memorials of him. His personal history was the subject of tradition alone, and became, in the lapse of time, so intermingled with fables, that it is impossible to fix upon any <num value="1">one</num> circumstance related with regard to him, as an undoubted truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The other lived, it is true, in a highly enlightened age. He did not, as somebody has said, stand up grand and solitary, like <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Teneriffe, Henderson, North Carolina" key="tgn,2714714">Teneriffe</placeName>,</hi> in the midst of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>He rather resembled <persName n="Blanc,,Mont,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00320" reg="default:Blanc,Mont,,,"><foreName>Mont</foreName> <surname>Blanc</surname></persName>, in the middle of the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>He was surrounded by great men, and he was a head and shoulders taller than them all. It cannot but strike everybody as extremely singular, that we should know no more of him, individually, than we do know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>In fact, so far as the undoubted knowledge which we have of his acts and sayings may serve to give us an idea of his character, he is as unknown to us as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName></hi> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The names of the <num value="2">two</num> men are mere symbols &mdash; symbols of the poetic gift in its highest state of perfection &mdash; as entirely symbolical as the name of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Apollo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00322" reg="mostcommon:Apollo,nomatch:0"><surname>Apollo</surname></persName>,</hi> or that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Esculapius.</hi> We thought it singular that such should be the lot common to <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> men whom the world has agreed to call the greatest of poets, and we doubted whether their individual obscurity might not be the penalty of their pre-eminence in song. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> If we doubted before, however, our doubts were removed by thinking upon their compeer, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00323" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName>.</hi> Unlike his mighty brethren, he has left abundant traces of his personal history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>No man of his day was better known in his day, and no man of his day is better known to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He was a warrior and legislator, as well as poet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>He stood high in <num value="1">one</num> of the parties whose quarrels at that time shook <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName> to its centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He was exiled for his adherence to an unfortunate faction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Of course his life was public, and could not fail to be recorded, when his poem had given his name such a wonderful power of attraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>In a contemporary--<num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> prose writers, as he continues to be <num value="1">one</num> of the best &mdash; in the inimitable <hi rend="smallcaps">Boccaio,</hi> he found a biographer, whose pride it was to record the incidents of his life with minute punctuality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>So far he differed from his great rivals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Is his fate enviable in that respect?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>We should think not. If we were a great poet, we should say, <q>&#x0022;remember my works forever, read them, preserve them, hand them down to the latest posterity; but for me, individually, lay me in the grave when I am dead, throw the earth upon my coffin, and there let me lie until summoned to judgment by the last trumpet.--Let not me, and my actions, and my sayings, be the subject of prurient curiosity to the gossips of future ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>There was no means of dragging himself or his concerns into the narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> brings on the stage persons long since dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>They speak only of things that happened long ago, in which they were actors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>They could not speak of the poet, because they lived long before he was born, and they <hi rend="italics">do</hi> speak as though they were living in the world of their own day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>His poem is a record of what he saw with his own eyes, and of the reflections which he makes thereupon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It is like a book of travels, in which the traveller notes each particular incident as it occurs, and makes his comments as he goes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In <num value="1">one</num> respect, at least, he surpasses all other writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>His poem is the most original book that ever was written.--<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00330" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>,</hi> undoubtedly, made free use of the materials that had been left by older Rhapsodists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>He tells us himself that the exploits of the <name>Greeks</name> at the siege of <placeName reg="Troy, Rensselaer, New York" key="tgn,7014660">Troy</placeName> had been sung before his day. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Shakspeare,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00331" reg="mostcommon:Shakspeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakspeare</surname></persName>,</hi> not only re-wrote many old plays, but he is indebted for all his plots (or nearly all) to something that was in print before his time.
