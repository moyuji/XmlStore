<head>The policy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> As the war drags its slow length along, the <rs>British Government</rs> avails itself of every suitable occasion to reiterate, in terms too explicit and emphatic to admit of misconstruction, its positive determination not to intervene in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It strikes us that the <rs>British Government</rs> might save breath and time by saying nothing more on that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>If its object is to dispel from the <rs>South</rs> the false hopes it entertained on that subject, it may rest satisfied that the <rs>South</rs> has long ago ceased to look for foreign intervention, and has learned not to put its trust in princes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Nor is this all. The South, from its own experience of war, might be disposed not much to censure <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for avoiding a dire alternative which has already entailed upon her an enormous national debt and national and individual distress beyond computation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>But it has become painfully evident to reflecting men in the <rs>South</rs> that the policy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in this contest is impartial not so much in friendship as in enmity; that it seeks with equal regards the mutual destruction of <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, and that it refuses to interfere in this war simply because the war is the very thing which she has been laboring to bring about for the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, and because peace in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> is just what she does not want till both parties are so worn out and helpless as no longer to be an object of alarm to each other or to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The long and persistent efforts of the <rs>British Government</rs> to inflame the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the old Union against each other through the influence of abolition, and the immediate disappearance of that question from all prominence in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> or soon as it had produced its destined fruits in the division and civil war in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, are too significant to have escaped the observation of calm and dispassionate spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The only solution of <name>English</name> policy afforded by her course during the present war is that she desires equally the destruction of <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, so that she may make the world dependent upon the cotton production of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> for its supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>No other theory has been suggested which at all explains and harmonizes the whole policy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in peace and war, towards the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The supreme malevolence of such counsel is no argument against their existence, for nations know no conscience, no principles, no humanity, no law of any kind but their own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>At this moment the <rs>British Government</rs> beholds, unmoved, the terrible distress among its own manufacturers; and if I can permit its own people to suffer thus, for the purpose of working out the ultimate independence of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the production of cotton, we cannot wonder that she is supremely indifferent to the distress of strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>These remarks apply exclusively to the <rs>Government</rs>, and not to the people, who, in general, sympathize with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and, if their voice could be heard, would recognize the <rs>South</rs> to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>With or without recognition, however, our independence is equally certain, and we shall have no favors to acknowledge, no friends to reward, no interests but our own to make supreme. </p> </div3>

<head>Raving over dissolution.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It never seems to have entered into the minds of the <rs>Northern</rs> people that the late <q>&#x0022;glorious Union&#x0022;</q> can ever be dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They insist upon it that it still lives; they seize its corpse, those bereaved mourners, and punch and kick it, to prove that it can never be destroyed; they deface and disfigure it to improve its beauty, and run bayonets through its heart to increase its energies and perpetuate its vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is evident that they are run, or they could never expect to restore the <q>&#x0022;loved and lost&#x0022;</q> by such unseemly appliances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> It is impossible to behold the emotions of these hapless lunatics over their defunct Union without amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Why does not the world take them and put them in a straight-jacket? --They may do themselves some harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We find it impossible to sympathize with their woe, excessive as it is. Never had a people better cause to be inconsolable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>When Shylock lost his diamonds and his daughter, well might he rave and glut over the promised pound of flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>And what mountains of diamonds has <persName n="Jona,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jona,nomatch:0"><surname>Jona</surname></persName> than lost in this incredible <q>&#x0022;dissolution,&#x0022; </q> and what a troop of daughters, fairer and more heroic than Jessica.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Never did people have such picking and plucking as <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> of the <rs>South</rs>, and never was people so reconciled as the <rs>South</rs> to being picked and plucked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The pleasure, in her case, seemed quite <q>&#x0022;as great in being cheated as to cheat.&#x0022;</q> It appeared to afford her a positive luxury to have <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> clothe and supply her, and run his arms to the elbows in her capacious pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>With <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> leeches hanging on to her plethoric veins, she yielded herself to the most delightful slumber and repose, so that when the leeches had to be removed, she seemed almost as melancholy as those amiable blood suckers themselves at the dissolution of the <q>&#x0022;<orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> What an inexhaustible mine has gone forever!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>No wonder the <rs>North</rs> refuses to believe it treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No wonder it frantically raises a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men to restore the <rs>Union</rs> sentiment of the <rs>South</rs> by slaughtering all its inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is a fine lunatic conceit to bring back a man to life, who is supposed to have only fainted, by blowing his brains out. That extraordinary method of preventing dissolution is worthy the howling madmen, possessed with a whole legion of devils, whose hands are dripping with the blood of our people but whom, with the aid of Heaven, we shall soon whip back to their dens of cruelty and crime. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> The readers of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> will recollect that about <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> ago, when the little <rs>Napoleon</rs> had just begun to date his blustering bulletins from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, the wonderful genius that site on the tripod of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> predicted, with inimitable complacency that he would rival <num value="1">one</num> of the most famous exploits of the great <rs>Napoleon</rs>, by making of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, and capturing or destroying all the forces assembled for its defence, Nothing, he seemed to think, could be more easy or more certain of accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The little <rs>Napoleon</rs> had but to march upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, to surround it with his invincible legions, and to call upon its defenders to march out and lay down their arms at the feet of the terrible <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Then was to begins the punishment of the daring <q>&#x0022;rebels,&#x0022;</q> who had ventured to defy the power and spurn the offers of the magnanimous <rs>Abraham</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Then the hanging was to commence &mdash; not to be exercised indiscriminately upon all offenders, but with a wise discrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Selections were to be made for the rope, with a view to cut off the heads of the <q>&#x0022;conspiracy,&#x0022;</q> it being presumed that the members would remain quiet when the head was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Then the forfeiture of estates was to begin, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were to buy out the whole Southern States, as property forfeited for treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>We ventured at the time to express a doubt as to the possibility of carrying out this humane programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We could see no resemblance between the movements of the great and the little <rs>Napoleon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We did not think, moreover, even though the smaller of the <name>Napoleons</name> were imbued with all the genius of the greater, his army was quite equal to that which captured <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, and which <persName n="Thiers,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Thiers,nomatch:0"><surname>Thiers</surname></persName> tells us was the finest the <rs>Emperor</rs> ever commanded.

With less than all of them &mdash; not withstanding the high qualities of his almost unrivalled army &mdash; we did not believe he could have captured <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, and as the little <rs>Napoleon</rs> had them not, and as, moreover, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was harder to take than <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, we did not conceive that he would take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, especially as we had no <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName> here. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> We think even the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> prophet will hardly deny that we came nearer the mark than he did. So far from proving an Ulm. <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> turned out to be much more like a Leipsic to the little <rs>Napoleon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>So far from cutting to pieces <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of our army and shutting up and taking the remainder, he himself narrowly escaped being taken, with his entire force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>So far from defeating us in <num value="8">eight</num> distinct engagements, as the <rs>French</rs> defeated the <name>Austrians</name> before they enclosed them in <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, he himself was beaten in <num value="8">eight</num> pitched battles before this city; and so far from entering <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in triumph, as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> entered <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, he fled to the protection of his gunboats, and sneaked away like a thief in the night, after he had lost <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>And now where is the little <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Has he struck any great blow to redeem the immeasurable disasters of his campaign before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> ? On the contrary, he has just suffered a disaster greater than any of those he suffered in that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Instead of taking our whole army, he has had <num value="12000">12,000</num> of his best troops captured by us. Instead of repeating the disaster of <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName> to us, he has himself suffered a disaster almost as great as that of <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, <measure n="150miles" type="distance">one hundred and fifty miles</measure> off.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> After all his falsifications of its prophecies, the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> still clings to the Little Napoleon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>And it is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He is beyond question the best General the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have, if there be any <hi rend="italics">best</hi> where all are so incomparably bad. Perhaps it would be more proper to say he is the least indifferent among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>He is certainly not so bad as the lying braggart and blackguard <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, or the almost equally mendacious <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,Henry,W.,,"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have not only no General, but it seems to us they have no materials out of which a General can be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>A generation devoted to money getting can hardly possess many of the heroic virtues, and among a people where the heroic virtues do not exist, the material for forming <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> cannot be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> has furnished the <rs>South</rs> with a number of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, worthy to rank with those of any service in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>We will not attempt to enumerate, for the number is so great that some of them would be sure to escape our memory, and it would be invidious not to name all, for all &mdash; each in his separate sphere &mdash; deserve to be named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The same school, on the other hand, has given to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> no name greater than that of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,Gen,,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, the hero of a dozen defeats, and only <num value="1">one</num> victory </p> </div3>
