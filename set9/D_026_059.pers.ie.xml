<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, not being sufficiently drunk with military excitement, are preparing to work themselves up into a grand furore over the election of a President.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The present incumbent is desirous of re-election, if indeed it can be called a re-election, seeing he has never yet enjoyed the coveted felicity of being <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of what was once the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but which ceased to be the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> when he assumed the reins of power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We are not at all surprised that <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> insists on <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> holding his place till all the <name>States</name> over which he was chosen to preside, acknowledge his benignant away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>If he holds on till that period he will have a longer reign than all the monarchs of all time together.--It is natural that he should desire some compensation for being kept out of his own, the whole term for which he was originally elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>What a sorry time he has had of it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The votes of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> could make him <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but not of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In all that time he has no more been our <rs type="role2">President</rs> than the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He has raised an army of more than a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men and we know not how many <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of money, but the guns of his <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> have been as powerless as their votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Still he is not <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of what he calls the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He is now about to make another effort, combining ballots and bullets, and by the <date value="11-04">4th of November</date> next we shall see what we shall see. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> It appears that in this great and final effort to be <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of all the <name>States</name>, the unhappy <rs>Lincoln</rs> is destined to meet with opposition in the <rs>North</rs> as well as the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The people of the &#x0022;rebellious provinces&#x0022; are so well pleased with their freedom from his vulgar and villainous despotism that they will fight him to the end of time rather than permit him to rule over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In the <rs>North</rs>, some even of his own party are solicitous to have his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The wooly <rs>Fremont</rs>, who enjoyed the honor of being thoroughly flagellated by <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>; the warlike <rs>Banks</rs>, who enjoyed the same distinction, with the additional eclat of serving as Commissary to the same Confederate leader; the <rs>Greenback Chase</rs>, whose financial achievements have eclipsed, if that were possible, the glory of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> arms, are all eager to relieve their venerable chief of the cares of State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>His old enemies, the <rs>Union</rs> loving Democracy, will not be wanting in this critical juncture to their duty to themselves and the spoils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is not the man to be scared from his hold of power by false friends or hungry foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The whole world knows, and no <num value="1">one</num> better than himself, that he was elected to his present position, not on account of superior qualifications for the <name>Presidency</name>, but on account of superior qualifications for being the tool of a party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>No man approaches him in that respect, and no man is wanted there but <num value="1">one</num> who will be a tool, and nothing but a tool, of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> mob. Brains are not wanted, heart is not wanted, not even brute courage is wanted; nothing but a voice that can echo and a hand that can register the black passions and beastly purposes of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> populace.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> What the result of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> election will be it is impossible to predict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If its people were like any other people the vulgar ignoramus who has stolen away their liberties would never be permitted to retain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But he has the enormous patronage of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> at his back, and the nation whom he rules are not insensible to the captivations of gold; he has a formidable standing army at his back, and the he roil population of the <rs>North</rs> is not insensible to the emotion of fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Nevertheless, they are a fickle as well as ferocious race, and it may occur to them that the re-election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> won't pay. Once convinced of that interesting fact, and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> goes back to his rail-splitting with a universal kick from the universal <rs>Yankeedom</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It rests with the soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to furnish them the only argument which they are capable of comprehending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The military campaign will decide the political campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It remains for the armies of the <rs>South</rs> to say whether <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> shall or shall not be the next <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> should vie with each other in rendering honors and more substantial tokens of admiration to the returned <num value="800">eight hundred</num> Confederate prisoners now in our city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They have been enduring untold horrors in Northern prisons, yet, amidst them all, have resisted every effort to make them acknowledge allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and preserved pure and with out a flaw the spotless <rs>Chrystal</rs> of their integrity and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Every man in this city who has a heart in his bosom will make haste to welcome and provide for them.--Our city has just been saved by the hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> from the most awful doom that ever impended over a community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Shall we not express our gratitude not only by thanks-giving in our temples, but by these good works of love, beneficence and mercy which are so acceptable to Heaven, and which are a just debt to these noble and glorious men. Should <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> at such a moment fall to do her duty to these returned prisoners, she would prove herself lost to every sentiment of gratitude to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We doubt whether the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution ever produced anything more patriotic, grand, and soul inspiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>I believe that the <rs>Emperor</rs> is too just to attribute such a difference of opinion to anything but a regard for the policy which we think right, and which we think the interest of this country calls upon us to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Now, no such proposal was ever made to us.

<head>The <placeName reg="Southwest, Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2093239">Southwest</placeName>--the recent successful operations there.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>The skill, success, and energy displayed by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the <rs>Southwest</rs> in the recent operations in that section can only be fully appreciated since we have had the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> version of the brief and utterly unproductive campaign which has been an admirably and so completely foiled and defeated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> This campaign was designed on the grandest scale of any which the enemy has projected during the war. It has the impress of <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00315" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName>'s comprehensive closet strategy, and embraced a field of operations the most extensive, and a series of combinations the most elaborate, that have yet been essayed by the enemy, or by any commanders in ancient or modern warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>This plan comprehended a general advance from all the various positions held by the enemy in the vast extent of our territory stretching from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> westward to <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> southward to New Orleans, and from New Orleans eastward to the <rs type="place">Florida coast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>No wonder that the imaginative and sensational <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> editors should grow exultant and jubilant over such a magnificent scheme, and should predict from its certain success &mdash; as the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName> and other journals did &mdash; an early termination of the war. It is of no practical consequence that we should examine and criticise the wisdom or practicability of the scheme, and on that score content ourselves with the expression of our hope that the author and planner of it will be continued in his high functions of directing the strategy of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The miserable failure of this enterprise, and the skill, promptitude, masterly strategy and vigor with which it was met and defeated at all points by our commanders and our gallant soldiers, furnish us grounds of exultation, confidence, and general hopefulness, such as no previous campaign of this war has given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Let us all remember how, but a few weeks ago, after the disaster at <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were so confident that the backbone of the rebellion was broken, and that all that remained to finish the war was for <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00316" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to advance into the interior and disperse the scattered fragments of our defeated armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>It is not to be denied that the disasters at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and that last defeat at <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, had produced great depression in some of the <rs>Southwestern States</rs>, particularly in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>This depression was compounded of disgust, of distrust of our commanders, and an apprehension that the <rs>Government</rs> had abandoned that section of the country in order to defend other sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>There was, therefore, a large desertion and scattering among our armies, especially in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> were greatly perplexed to maintain and keep up their commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>The success of <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00317" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00318" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Maury,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00319" reg="mostcommon:Maury,nomatch:0"><surname>Maury</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00320" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, in resisting these causes of demoralization and preserving the spirit and efficiency of their commands, reflects upon them an even higher glory than the most brilliant victories in the field could merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>After successfully resisting these causes of demoralization, and keeping up the organization of these little armies, it was only necessary for these <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to accomplish some military successes to revive the confidence and spirits of the people and recall them to their flag and their posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>This <hi rend="italics">prestige,</hi> so much needed in the <rs>Southwest</rs>, to correct and eradicate the terrible depression produced by the disasters of previous campaigns has, we think, been effected by the recent most complete and thorough defeat of the most extensive plan of operations yet designed by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Henceforth we have reason to believe that throughout the <rs>Southwest</rs> there will be a general rally around the leaders who have given such high proofs of ability, zeal, and devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Our armies will quickly fill up their ranks and under leaders in whom they trust, they will not rest content with merely defeating, but will pursue and drive the enemy without and far beyond our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Meantime, let our Government see that these armies are strengthened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Let not the idea that so valuable a section of our country as the <rs type="place">Valley of the Mississippi</rs> is neglected by our Government, have the slightest foundation or color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The reinforcement of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> appears to us to be of the highest moment, and to promise as much of real practical benefit to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as that of any other force now in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>That army has a mission of vast importance, and from the skill with which it is handled by the patriotic and energetic commander, we have every confidence that, its mission will be performed if the infantry force can be augmented so as to enable the <rs>General</rs> to take the field and drive the enemy out of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and recover possession of the left bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>When the fact is known, as we have it from the highest authority, that the recent formidable movement of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00322" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00323" reg="mostcommon:Smith,nomatch:0"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Grierson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00324" reg="mostcommon:Grierson,nomatch:0"><surname>Grierson</surname></persName> was defeated by <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00325" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> with a force not equal to that of the enemy, and with a loss of not over a <measure n="100" type="killed, wounded and captured">hundred killed, wounded and captured</measure>, and without the loss of a pound of the <rs>Government</rs> provisions, munitions, or of any kind of property, or of that of the railroad companies, we think the very highest title to the confidence of the <rs>Government</rs> and people is afforded that the skill and ability displayed in these difficult and embarrassing circumstances, if properly backed and sustained by the <rs>Government</rs>, would soon recover the magnificent stretch of country which has been now too long virtually in the possession or subject to the constant raids of the enemy. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
