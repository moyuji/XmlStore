<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> I see urged in your columns as well as others, the necessity of the farmers supplying the demands of the <rs>Government</rs> upon them for provisions for the army with a liberal hand and at reasonable prices, that the necessity for falling back may be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>I can state that it is my opinion, and the opinion of others with whom I have conversed, that could they fully be persuaded that such a calamity would befall them, that there is not <num value="1">one</num> east of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge mountains</rs> and between the <placeName reg="Rapidan and James river">Rapidan and James river</placeName>, who would not with an even supply of provisions for their families, and provender for their stock, cheerfully yield from <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> to <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the same to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>I think I say correctly that the farmers in this section of the country, as a general thing, have met the claims of the <rs>Government</rs> upon them with alacrity when well-defined and understood by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I will state that the tax law in kind has been variously understood, and while <num value="1">one</num> might believe that he was bound by his construction or understanding of the law to furnish his gross crop of corn for assessment, many in the same neighborhood have thought, and been encouraged in the belief by Quartermasters' agents collecting tithes, and others, that the law required them to furnish for assessment only what remained after fattening their hogs; and, without any dishonest intention, have had their crops of corn so assessed &mdash; and the arguments used in favor of the latter construction are these: To tax the gross crop of corn <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> and then the pork fattened on the same <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> seems to be taxing the corn-again in the park, which the law could not have meant to do. Now, if this construction of the law be erroneous, and has been as generally acted upon throughout the <rs>State</rs> as it has been in some sections of the country, I venture to assert that in the majority of such cases not more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> or <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the tithe of corn has been assessed or collected, and has thereby occasioned the loss of many <measure n="1000barrels" type="mass">thousand barrels</measure> to the <rs>Government</rs>, if it be not hereafter collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>For instance; a crop of corn of <measure n="80barrels" type="mass">80 barrels</measure> taxed gross would give <measure n="6barrels" type="mass">6 barrels</measure>, fatten <num value="20">20</num> hogs, and they will consume at a moderate estimate <measure n="30barrels" type="mass">30 barrels</measure>, and with that reserved the tax on the remainder will be <measure n="3barrels" type="mass">3 barrels</measure>. I believe that instructions from the proper authority to agents to collect such reserves, and request through the public prints all who had committed such errors to correct them, would be of great good to the country. </p> <closer> <signed>A Louisa Farmer.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>

<head>The next meeting of Congress.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> Nothing, however plain, can come before Congress without undergoing an amount of <hi rend="italics">talk</hi> sufficient for the gravest questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We should think that if there <hi rend="italics">could</hi>be any proposition that admitted of no dispute, that to assemble the next Congress, at an early day after the adjournment of this, would be of this character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Yet it has already endured more speeches than were made in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> upon the bill for <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> emancipation, the passage of which produced a radical change in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> In such times as these Congress ought always to be in session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Every day in the year something occurs which demands their immediate attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It should have been here last <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, when the defeat at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> occurred, to take immediate steps for parrying the effects of that disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It did not meet until <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> after that event, and, except the repeal of the substitute law, it has done nothing even yet. According to <persName n="Staples,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="mostcommon:Staples,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Staples</surname></persName>, the whole time they have actually been in session since the commencement of the war has been about <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure>--that is, about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the time the war has lasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It does not become that body to devolve its cares upon the <rs>Executive</rs>; while its members are taking their pleasure at home, just as if the country were quiet, and this the time of Hickory Clubs and Log Cabins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The Congress of <num value="76">76</num> never adjourned for any considerable time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>They were always in place, and always engaged in their public duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>No other revolutionary Legislature that we ever heard of ever left its post to seek rest and pleasure at home while the earth was trembling in the convulsions of a revolution beneath their feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They ought to be here at their posts; there will always be enough for them to do. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The rank and file.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> A correspondent in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, and an esteemed personal friend, is pleased to express his approbation of a recent editorial in this paper advocating the claims of the private soldiers to the gratitude of their country and the consideration of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>He is greatly mistaken, however, in the impression that this is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time attention has been called in these columns to the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The memory of our regular readers and the files of this journal will bear witness that, from the beginning of the war to the present hour, if any <num value="1">one</num> topic connected with the army has received more editorial attention than any other, it has been the rank and file, whose prodigious sacrifices for the common cause, and whose purely disinterested devotion present altogether the brightest and most immortal chapter in the history of this country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> We are sorry to hear from our correspondent, (himself an officer and therefore a dispassionate witness,) that there are some officers in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service who treat the noble soldiers whom they have the honor to command as inferior beings, mere machines, like the mercenaries of a standing army, and never manifest towards them the sympathy and kindly attentions which are so dear to the soldier's heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We hope the number of such military popinjays is small, for straggling and desertion in the army will never be put a stop to, where their influence extends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>It is easy enough to talk of enforcing military discipline, and unless it is enforced, we might as well not have an army, but the strongest discipline in camp or court, in earth or heaven, is that which flows from Love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The fear of hell itself has never melted the human heart like the influence of Divine Benevolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>There are few men in the world so thoroughly depraved that they cannot be more easily drawn by affection than driven by fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Such exceptional reprobates there may be in the army as well as in other vocations, and upon them the severe penalties should be dealt without mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>But the great mass of our rank and file are as much gentlemen as the officers who command, and deserve a great deal more credit, as we have often said, than the officers, because they have no earthly motive, except love of country, to prompt their heroic exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>As gentlemen they ought to and must be treated, if the army is to retain its efficiency, and the peculiar spirit of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier to be developed. --Whilst discipline is strictly enforced, the soldier should be elevated, instead of depressed, in his own esteem by the treatment of the officer; he should never be permitted to lose the self-respect and conscious dignity of the gentleman which he brought with him to the army; he should never be permitted to forget that he has as much interest in the contest as the officers by whom he is led. We believe that most of our officers, like our intelligent correspondent, have the good feeling and the good sense to take this view of the subject, but there are some miserable exceptions, and they have done more harm to the service than their bedizened little carcases, buttons, gold lace, and all are worth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> At the same time, we hold it to be the solemn duty of the private soldier, who may happen to have over his head a cold-hearted and tyrannical officer &mdash; his duty to himself not less than to his country &mdash; to obey in all things, and to stick to his colors to the last, not for the sake of his officer, but of his cause, and of his own character &mdash; a character too high at home, and too long maintained in the fiery furnace of this war's tribulations to be sacrificed at this time of day on account of any kind of sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>If there are some Southern officers who treat their men almost as harshly as <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers, let there be no privates in our ranks who can be driven, like <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> privates, to faithlessness and desertion by the misconduct of hard-hearted officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Let them live and endure all for the sake of their country, and their constancy and virtue, equal to and worthy of their he clam, will ultimately receive a deserved reward. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
