<head>From the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Our news from the line of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> yesterday was more of a general than especial character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The movements of the enemy's forces, and the consequent operations of our own army, are mysteriously, and perhaps property, concealed from the public, and all that is allowed to transpire has reference to events that occurred nearly a week ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> of last week, <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, with a body of cavalry, made a descent upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at <placeName reg="Catlett's Station">Catlett's Station</placeName>, on the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName>, which, if our information be not in fault, resulted in the capture of some <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> non- commissioned officers and privates, and <num value="17">seventeen</num> commissioned officers, including <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role2">Captains</rs> and a Quartermaster, in addition to these, they also captured the uniform coat of <persName n="Pope,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Maj. Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>, his sword, <num value="2">two</num> horses, and his servant, and some <measure n="60001dollars" type="currency">sixty thousand 1 dollars</measure> in specie and Treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>After this haul our wearied troops were permitted to rest until about <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the enemy having rallied, vigorously assailed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The foe was repulsed, but <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> deeming it prudent to retire, fell back to <placeName reg="Warrenton Springs">Warrenton Springs</placeName>, a little after daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The party also captured a mall which had been made up to send to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, by <persName n="Pops,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Pops,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pops</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This was sent back to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and is <unclear></unclear> to contain some important revelations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The coal of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General was yesterday sent to <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>. </p>

The accepted conclusion was that the enemy had made a stand, and that a great battle was impending, if not in actual progress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Parties from <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> as late as yesterday morning, state that it was reliably ascertained at that point on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, with <num value="40000">40,000</num> men, had arrived at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and was attempting to join <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, having come up in time to prevent <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s retreat from becoming a total rout. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> It is stated that the demoralization in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army is great, the officers fearing to enter up on a battle, lest they might be captured and subjected to the retaliatory treatment in store for them in that event and that the men, on account of the cowardice of the officers, swore that they would not fight, but would follow the example of their superiors, and run too. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>From all we can gather &mdash; and we have tried to inform ourselves of the true condition of affairs &mdash; there is not the slightest ground for anxiety for the entire safety of our army in that quarter, and its ability to drive back the invading hosts beyond the confines of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The prisoners captured on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and Saturday were yesterday at <placeName reg="Rapidan station">Rapidan station</placeName>, and will be brought on to this city as soon as transportation can be conveniently provided. </p> </div3>

<head>Rumors about the gunboats.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Rumor was busy in the streets yesterday with a gunboat raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was rumored that <num value="11">eleven</num> sail of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vessels were coming up the river, and <num value="4">four</num> of them were about <measure n="18miles" type="distance">18 miles</measure> below the <rs type="place">Bluff</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>All these exact figures were spoiled by later information, which assured all hands concerned that there were no vessels in the river. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Under these circumstances it will be necessary to change many of the plates and to make new issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The change would be more complete by dispensing with the variety of signatures which are attached to the other notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I am informed by the engravers that the signatures of the <name>Register</name> and Treasurer might be engraved in <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">fac simile,</foreign></hi> and printed, and that by stamping an elaborate engraving in colors on the back of the note the security against counterfeits would be greater than it is at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The expense of the issue would be diminished by dispensing with the numerous signing clerks, and its more prompt execution would be secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In order to make this change the authority of Congress is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The laws against counterfeiting (If not already sufficient) must be made to embrace these notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In this connection, too, it is proper to bring to the notice of Congress that the penalties of the law, while they apply to any person found in possession of counterfeit blank notes, with intent to utter them, do not seem to embrace notes which are completely filled up and ready for circulation. </p> </q><bibl n="Secretary of the Treasury"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<head>The Confederate War operations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> The campaign in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> for the last <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> has been <num value="1">one</num> of great energy and wall-proved sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The operations before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were certainly of a character to entitle an army and <unclear></unclear> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to the highest honor; for enterprise, forecast, and heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The failure to capture a larger number of the invading army under <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is matter of criticism, but in no way affects the reputation of the army and its <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The settled opinion thus far, in the absence of official explanation, is that it was owing to failures to fulfill orders in proper time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>But whether or no this be so, there is honor and glory enough in the grand triumphs won by our army in saving <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> With all proper expedition, after the enemy had escaped to the river and gunboats, a part of the noble army which had served so faithfully in the protection of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> repaired promptly to defend our country from another large invading force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>What it has achieved there is in part known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The <rs n="Battle of Cedar Run" type="battle">battle of Cedar Run</rs> has added another to the long list of victories of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>; but we do not know the hardest service of the expedition: the long marches and the fatiguing man&#x0153;uvres of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We do not know what has been achieved in strategy yet. A little time will develop the result of the activity and vigilance of the new policy which there is reason to believe has been determined on in the main <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> In <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, or that part embracing the <rs type="place">Kanawha Valley</rs> and the <rs>Southwest</rs>, the results do not realize anticipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The Confederate force there has achieved little or nothing for our arms, and less in the way of advantage to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Why this is so we know not, though there are of course rumors of disagreement among officers, and failures to effect combinations which were deemed important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Fortunately the enemy has been so absorbed in his more important undertakings that he has been unable to take advantage of our apathy, and it is now understood has voluntarily surrendered much of the ground he was unreasonably allowed to occupy for months. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> The campaign in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, where affairs had been badly managed, seems to be more energetic, and <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> is evidently endeavoring to threw more energy and spirit into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s gallantry and during have had a good influence, no doubt, and assisted in inaugurating movements in the entire <placeName reg="Mississippi Valley">Mississippi Valley</placeName>, which are as encouraging to the <rs>South</rs> as they are alarming to the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> In the <rs>Valley</rs> of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> the main opposing forces, under <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> and <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, have been for months watching each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>We have had many rumors about daily expected battles, but no fight yet. It is now stated that <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> is retreating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> Beyond the <rs>Mississippi</rs> our cause has met with very partial reverses for <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> past, while we have generally triumphed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Everywhere the <rs>Federals</rs> have been discomfited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Our rangers and guerrillas have made such headway as to excite the greatest alarm in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> The field shows apathy only partial, while there is a marked increase of activity and energy generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Let us hope that what we know of the more important division of our army is an earnest of an active policy, that will not admit of intervals of repose in which the enemy will recuperate and in crease his means of invasion, while we lose energy, spirit, and strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The administration of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> has been active under its present head, and we may conjecture from the past that the means placed in its power will be properly and zealously applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>More force, untiring vigilance, and never flagging activity, should be the rule of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> until the enemy proposes peace. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
