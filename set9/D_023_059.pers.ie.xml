<head>Our army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--particulars of the passage of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The news received yesterday afternoon removes every doubt that may have heretofore existed with reference to the passage of the <rs>Potomac</rs> by our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We have at last intelligence from the <rs>Northern</rs> banks of that stream, which gives us the unmistakable assurance that the feet of our gallant soldiers now tread the soil of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> A distinguished officer, who participated in the fights at and around <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, arrived in this city yesterday afternoon by the <rs>Central</rs> train, and left the forces which he commands on the left bank of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. To him we are indebted for the following particulars: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, during the day, the cavalry force under command of <persName n="Robertson,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, engaged a portion of the enemy's forces near <placeName key="tgn,2111722" n="1.000 6" reg="falls church, falls church, virginia">Fall's Church</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Nearly the entire day was spent in skirmishing between the contending parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>While this was going on our army was being withdrawn from the vicinity of the late battle fields, and marched in the direction of the upper Potomac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>At nightfall <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> drew off his force and followed the <rs>Army Early</rs> the next morning his brigade crossed the river at--,some distance below <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>At or near the same time, the <orgName>division of <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Hill,George,W.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName></orgName> commenced crossing at another point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Later in the day, the veteran <orgName>corps of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Joseph,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName></orgName> reached--,and at once proceeded in pass over, and before night the passage had been successfully effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> followed and during the night joined the other corps on the opposite shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Another division is said to have crossed at--,several miles higher up the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The officer with whom we conversed informs us that no resistance to their passage was at any time offered, and the whole affair was accomplished in the most admirable order, and without the firing of a gun. The condition of the river greatly favored the passage, of our troops, the water being at a low stage, and easily forded.--The men were in the highest spirits, and shout after shout went up as regiment after regiment reached the <rs>Maryland</rs> shore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> There were not a few reports in circulation yesterday in regard to the movements of our troops in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>These of course originate in the brisk imaginations of those who have little else to do than indulge in speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There can be no doubt that the <rs>Potomac</rs> has been crossed for a purpose, and that purpose will speedily develops itself in the demonstrations and future movements of our forces, we do not doubt, but reports as to their operations since they reached <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> are premature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Our informant left <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and the news he brings is as late as any received.--When he left for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the main body of the army was in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, but of any active movement there he was not advised, nor would <unclear></unclear> be proper to make them known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> In the <orgName type="regiment" key="4ALRegiment">4th Alabama regiment</orgName> <unclear></unclear> were killed and <measure n="46" type="wounded">46 wounded</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> <persName n="Pryor,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Pryor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pryor</surname></persName>, it is related to us, was at <num value="1">one</num> time a prisoner, but escaped from his <num value="3">three</num> captors, killing <num value="2">two</num> of them with a bayonet which he had seized from the hands of <num value="1">one</num> of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> It is stated that for <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> our troops lived almost entirely on corn taken from the fields on the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>A large proportion of them were bare footed, and a goodly number only half clothed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> When the army crossed the <rs>Potomac</rs> at <placeName reg="Edwards's Ferry">Edwards's Ferry</placeName>, there was an exciting race between many of the regiments to see who should get across <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and the boys dashed into the water with laughter and cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They were in the finest spirits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The object of the rebels may possibly be to create a diversion in the <rs>West</rs>, in order to detain as many Union troops as possible there, and prevent their reinforcement of our army in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But no doubt if they can they intend to capture <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, or both, though it would not be possible for them to retain possession of those cities while there is a Union gunboat in the <rs>Ohio</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>In the absence of our gunboats they might capture <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, as it is on the same side of the river with themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>As to <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, they could not capture it without crossing the <rs>Ohio</rs>, and that we think, is more than they will venture to undertake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The possession of <placeName reg="Covington, Kenton, Kentucky" key="tgn,7014762">Covington</placeName> by the rebels would therefore be tantamount to the destruction or capitulation of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>; for it consists largely of wooden buildings, and in a very short time could be destroyed by shells.

<head>The enemy's losses in the late operations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> The enemy admit a loss, down to <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, of <num value="17000">17,000</num> men, <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> officially stating his loss on that day to have been <num value="8000">8,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Baltimore</rs> papers it is said that the entire <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> loss, including that of <name>Saturday</name>, is <num value="32000">32,000</num> men &mdash; killed, wounded, and prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>This statement allows <num value="15000">15,000</num> for the lost on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>That the loss of that particular day was vastly greater than the enemy admit, we take to be certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>They are not the persons to overestimate their own losses, and, in the meantime, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> tells us that over <num value="7000">7,000</num> of them were taken and paroled on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>If they fought the battle with anything like the desperation they pretend, considering that it lasted <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure>, they certainly had more than <measure n="8000" type="killed and wounded">8,000 killed and wounded</measure>. The letter of <persName n="Coolidge,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00242" reg="mostcommon:Coolidge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Coolidge</surname></persName> is conclusive upon this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>He says that <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> after the battle there were still <measure n="3000" type="wounded">three thousand wounded</measure> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, uncared for within the lines of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00243" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It is very certain, if they were not cared for, it was because the number of wounded was so great that their turn had not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Our own wounded, not exceeding, it is said, <num value="3000">3,000</num>, could very well be attended to in a day, and then the turn of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Yet so numerous were they, that at the end of <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> <num value="3000">three thousand</num> of them had not received surgical assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>This indicates an enormous list of wounded, and confirms the report of <num value="1">one</num> officer, who puts down their killed at <num value="5000">5,000</num>, and their wounded at <num value="3">three</num> times that figure, making <measure n="20000" type="killed and wounded">20,000 killed and wounded</measure>, and of others who say that their killed and wounded were to us in the proportion of <num value="5">five</num>, <num value="6">six</num>, and even <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>As many prisoners were taken, who were not included in the <measure n="7000" type="paroled">7,000 paroled</measure> men mentioned by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, we do not think we make an overestimate when we set down the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> loss at <num value="30000">30,000</num> in round numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Their loss on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, estimated by <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> himself at <num value="8000">8,000</num>, added to their loss on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, makes <num value="38000">38,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Previous operations, including the <rs n="Battle of Cedar Run" type="battle">battle of Cedar Run</rs>, the several expeditions of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, and the various skirmishes in which we were almost uniformly victorious, we should think would fairly bring the total loss of the enemy &mdash; leaving out of the account the victory of <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, of which we have not the particulars &mdash; to <num value="50000">50,000</num> men, since our forces <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>In <num value="1">one</num> day he broke through the centre of the <name>Austrian</name> army, which was scattered over a vast extent of country, and placed himself between the <num value="2">two</num> wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>On the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct>, he fell upon the left, which he almost annihilated at <placeName key="tgn,2089948" n="1.000 10" reg="Landstreet, Somerset, Pennsylvania">Landstreet</placeName>, seizing its communications and cutting it off from <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>On the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct>, he attacked the right, under the <rs>Archduke Charles</rs>, at Eckmiehl, and totally routed it, forcing it off upon the <rs>Danube</rs> in a lateral direction, exactly like <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s change of base to <placeName reg="Westover, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2114993">Westover</placeName> and <persName n="Berkeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="mostcommon:Berkeley,nomatch:0"><surname>Berkeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The result, according to his statement, was a loss to the enemy of <num value="50000">50,000</num> men.
