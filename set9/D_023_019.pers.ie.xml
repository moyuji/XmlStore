<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Most of the buildings of the locality were used for railroad purposes, and except as a way station on the <rs>Central</rs> route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName> has heretofore possessed no special importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Within a circle of a few miles, however, reside many persons of wealth and influence, and it was apprehended that the enemy, had they come down in any force, would not have departed without indulging their usual propensity for robbery and pillage; but so far as we have been able to ascertain, this apprehension has not been realized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <persName n="Duke,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Duke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Duke</surname></persName>, the telegraph operator at the <rs type="place">Junction</rs>, took a hand car on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, and proceeded up as near as possible to <placeName reg="Beaver Dam Station, Allen, Ohio" key="tgn,2157696">Beaver Dam Station</placeName>, where he learned that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had taken their departure, after having done as much injury to the railroad as possible during the brief period of their visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They burned the depot, offices, water tank, and a large quantity of wood, and tore up the track in several places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The telegraph operator at the <rs type="place">Station</rs>, <persName n="Smith,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, was captured, but we understand that he succeeded in making his escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They manifested a strong desire to make a prisoner of <persName n="Fontaine,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Fontaine,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Fontaine</surname></persName>, the <rs>President</rs> of the rafimed, who resides in the vicinity; but in this they old not succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was doubtless their idea that in effecting the destruction of the railroad they could strike no more fatal blow than to capture a gentleman who has been closely identified with its interests from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of its existence; but they were either too cowardly or too weak to complete a work so boldly and impudently begun, and the result of the foray amounts to nothing more than a destruction of some little property and a temporary public inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is believed that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry engaged in this work were not more than <num value="150">150</num> strong, though there were probably more within reinforcing distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Although we have intelligence that the greater portion of the enemy's troops have been withdrawn from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> there is no doubt that they have parties scouring through the country below, and information communicated to them by a spy quite naturally led to this descent upon the railroad at <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invaders of the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs> have incurred the deep-seated hatred of the people of that section by a series of diabolical outrages, accounts of which continue to reach us from various sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They have robbed the farmers of almost everything they possessed, and carried their rascality so far as to burn the wheat after it had been out and shocked in the fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the lower part of <placeName reg="Shenandoah, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002190">Shenandoah</placeName> their robberies have despoiled the inhabitants of their stock, fowls, and all kinds of provisions, and what they could not devour or carry away they have destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It was noticed that some of the soldiers with <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> and <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName>, in their passage up the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, frequently cursed the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>, and asserted that they were a disgrace to any army; but no <num value="1">one</num> could see that they were any worse than the native born <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>-in crime and villainy they were all alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This is the sort of men sent into <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to win the confidence of the people and to restore the <rs>Union</rs> ! A letter from <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName> informs us that the condition of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army is by no means so flattering as the <rs>Northern</rs> papers would have us believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Desertions have been numerous, and stragglers in small squads are constantly passing through that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is hoped that a day of reckoning for all the oppression the people of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> have suffered is not far distant. </p> </div3>

The rights of the sovereign States of the <rs>South</rs>, the peace and lives of their people, are nothing in the scale against the rich fruits of their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>These the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> cannot give up. Oh, the <q>&#x0022;wicked rebellion,&#x0022;</q> says the sanctimonious <rs>Everett</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><q> &#x0022;It would be just as reasonable,&#x0022;</q> says he, <q>&#x0022;for a man in straitened circumstances to boast of his generosity in not going out to plunder defenceless travelers on the highway.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The articles are retailed to the people at prices which may well be deemed fabulous, and the consequence is that every necessary of life is held at similar rates; the producers arguing that so long as they are made to pay so enormously for goods, they must make up the amount by putting a starvation tariff upon vegetables, meats, fowls, butter, eggs, and other market supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>In the present state of affairs, there is no apology for commercial intercourse with the country beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs>, even if it were not for the purpose of encouraging speculation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> It is well that the plan of a joint mediation between the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> belligerents <hi rend="italics">failed even before it was formally proposed.</hi> The project would have been objectionable even if the time had been more opportune for pacific negotiations: and in the present temper of the <rs>Northern</rs> population any amicable settlement seems to be out of the question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> Even, however, if an early peace were intrinsically possible, <hi rend="italics">an English offer of mediation would have involved serious dangers.</hi> If it were summarily rejected, the proposal would nevertheless be resented as an encouragement to the seceders, and it would not be accepted unless the <rs>French Government</rs> were a partner in the transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Both members of the international tribunal might be suspected of a regard for selfish interests, but all imputations of unfairness would be habitually concentrated on <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> A war with Federal America would cost more than many crops of cotton are worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It would be a godsend to zealous politicians, who will shortly have to find an excuse for their reckless encouragement of the national delusion; and the antipathy which it would excite and almost justify would, for many generations, prevent the establishment of a solid and durable peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>When a rupture seemed almost unavoidable, after the seizure of the <rs>Trent</rs>, prudent men deeply regretted the necessity of a conflict which was certain to be misrepresented and misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>A war professedly waged for the establishment of Southern independence would be still more invidious, and it would not involve unanimity at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It is impossible that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should wish to establish or maintain negro slavery, and it by no means follows that an alliance with a slaveholding community would imply any favor to the institution which might be incidentally assisted; but the negro hating North would echo the fiercest denunciations of the <name>Abolitionists</name> against a Power which connected itself with the insurgent slave owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Against much loss and obloquy it is not easy to set off any counterbalance advantage which would make an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war expedient. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> Least of all, would it be profitable to follow <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> into a struggle which would necessarily be controlled by alien counsels and motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Just action in war is not recommended by the experience of recent years in the <name>Crimea</name>, in <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>, or in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Good faith and friendly feeling are no sufficient security for a lasting community of interests; and it might suit the purpose of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to make peace or to continue the war against the wish and opinion of the <rs>English Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>In either case a withdrawal from the alliance would be either dangerous or discreditable, and yet the objections to perseverance in joint action might be still more insurmountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The quarrels of <num value="2">two</num> Allies with a common enemy are never altogether identical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It might become necessary to mix up questions of <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> policy or of insults on the <rs>French</rs> flag with the main object of terminating a ruinous civil war.--The mere want of cotton is not precisely the same in character and in result, as it affects the trade of the <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>An armed intervention in the <rs>South</rs> would probably be popular at <placeName reg="Lyon, Rhone, Rhone-Alpes" key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName>, but it would certainly meet with general disapproval in <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>On the whole, it is better not to engage in an uncertain partnership; it is inexpedient to undertake the gratuitous duty of coercing the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> into commerce; and it is not even desirable to offer or to undertake a mediation which might probably end in an armed intervention by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>. </p> </div4> </div3>

<head>Triumph of Abolitionism.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> We need no better sign of the complete triumph of Abolitionism in the <rs>Northern Government</rs> than the shifting of sail by the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, which, from having been the bitter denouncer of the <name>Abolitionists</name> and their councils, charging upon them and their confiscation schemes the prolongation of the war, now gives in its approval of the measure for abolishing slavery, with compensation, as just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>It goes further and acquiesces in the evident ultimatum of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, that if abolition with compensation is rejected, then there must be abolition without it. It speaks of an interview between delegates in Congress from the border States and the <rs>President</rs> on this subject and the confiscation hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> declares that the <rs>President</rs> yielded nothing to their remonstrances, but pointed out to them the strait to which the border States were reduced, intimating that they had better come down gracefully and get pay. The delegates are represented to have gone off to consider the matter, and the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> infers that they are not likely to quarrel with their <q>&#x0022;bread and butter&#x0022;</q>--in other words that they will not prove rebellious, and that they will go home and advise their constituents to fall down and worship the <rs>Washington Juggernaut</rs> while the wheels of his tyranny grind them into dust. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> There is nothing in the recent uncontrolled and uncontrollable away of the <name>Abolitionists</name> at the <rs>North</rs> to alarm the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Since the war began it has been virtually <num value="1">one</num> of robbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The daily journals <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> have furnished the daily evidence of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The Federal invaders have never spared the property of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The slaves were always taken when they could be transported, or when they could be induced to leave their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>None of them have ever been returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>All other property has been appropriated to the uses of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> wherever they have gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>None but those traitors who took the oath of allegiance to the <rs>North</rs> were allowed to retain anything that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cupidity or appetite, or <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> malignity, desired to possess or wished to destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The pretended respect for the rights of property which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> occasionally puts on &mdash; his reproof of <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName> and others &mdash; were all the most unscrupulous frauds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>He and his Government had from the beginning inaugurated and maintained the principles of <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>They denied the right of slave property to Southern men &mdash; they ordered it to be taken and not to be returned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> The South gains by the open avowal of the policy somewhat insidiously pursued heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It is better that the <rs>South</rs> and the world should fully understand the policy of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>As a sequel to the last bold step, they have only to pass the measure enlisting and arming the slaves, to complete their new system of crushing the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>It is all the better that the world should know the real nature of the crusade against the <rs>South</rs> and the real temper of that brutal nation which will stop at nothing, however monstrous and barbarous, which they think can aid them in their war to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The South has been satisfied all along that their enemies would go the full length of the most inhuman suggestion of their diabolical malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It is gratifying to us that they have the boldness, or rather the madness, to avow their purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> The South defies them, as it has from the beginning and will to the bitter end. The people of the <rs>South</rs> know that there is neither reason nor humanity at the <rs>North</rs>--that they can only protect their rights from insatiable rapacity and the most malignant destructiveness by their own courage and constancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>They have no hope but this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The world will doubtless be amazed and horrified at the barbarity of our invaders; but our strong arms alone can protect us from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Their nation is doomed to defeat, and yet to stand before the world the convicted felon &mdash; the detected thief, foiled in an attempt which might have borrowed some dignity from success. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>We are used to their truculent talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>They must not suppose, because it is not retorted in kind, that the silence of the <rs>South</rs> arises from any other emotion than contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>We cannot bandy words with these animals, whose bark is worse than their bite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>When they put in execution some of their present inhuman threats, the <rs>South</rs> will reply, by taking an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
