<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> That the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of the <orgName n="Army of Kentucky" type="army">Army of Kentucky</orgName> has been damaged by the late ill-advised battle, is not to be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,Tom,,,"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, through a miscalculation of the strength of the enemy, and, it is believed, contrary to express instructions from <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Sydney,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, made an untimely advance and suffered seriously by reason of the superior force brought against him. Enough is known, however, to place the losses of the enemy <hi rend="italics">pari passu</hi> with ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But if this slight reverse, as it has turned out to be, cast a momentary gloom over the cause in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and made many loyal hearts sink with despondency, the vigor of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> has signalled the renewal of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Various were the reasons assigned for our defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Many of them were not complimentary to <persName n="Crittenden,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,Tom,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But when the facts came to be sifted, his conduct continued to appear in a better light, until now there is no whisper against his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The whole course of criticism is tersely summed up in <num value="4">four</num> words &mdash; <persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,Tom,,,"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> <unclear> erred</unclear> in judgment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The loss of <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> is a public calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>To a love of the <rs>South</rs>, which permeated every fibre of his nature, he added the chivalric spirit of an undaunted leader; and the men who followed his flag, and fought by his side, loved him with more than <q>&#x0022;Eastern devotion.&#x0022;</q> When the bullet pierced his heart, it is no wonder that Tennesseeans felt themselves without a leader, and the shock which his death produced on their minds must account for the precipitate flight of which they are reported to have been seized and possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The character of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> troops for intrepidity is too well and widely known to need mention by me, and the reference to their running on the present occasion is made as being a part of history, and as showing that scarcely any rule is so universal in its application as not to have exceptions. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>It provides a means in the <num value="2">two</num> forms of paper authorized, of <num value="650000000">six hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The late Administration left a debt of <measure n="100000000dollars" type="currency">$100,000,000</measure> Congress, at its extra session, authorized an additional loan of <measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">$150,000,000</measure>, which has been all taken except <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The banks, before they had paid all of the portion of this loan which they had taken, broke down under the load, and suspended specie payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The last of their payments was made yesterday, and on the same day the banks have refused to receive the <name>Treasury</name> notes, which must sink to depreciated money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The remaining <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> has been unable to negotiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>There is now a floating debt, audited and unaudited, of <num value="130000000">one hundred and thirty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The daily expenses of the <rs>Government</rs> are now about <num value="2000000">two millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>To carry us on till the next meeting of Congress will take <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> more, making about <num value="700000000">seven hundred millions</num> to be provided for. But as this Congress must provide for appropriations to <date value="1863-07"> July, 1863.</date> <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> more must be added to these expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>That would require <num value="420000000">four hundred and twenty millions</num>, which, added to the amount before estimated, makes <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>If the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="700000000">seven hundred millions</num> is forced on the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>I have no doubt that the bonds would sell as low as <num value="0.6">sixty per cent</num>, as in the last year; and even then, it would be found impossible to find payment in coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>But a large part must be accepted in the depreciated notes of non-specie paying banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>If the minimum discount that any reasonable man could fix say <num value="0.25">twenty-five per cent</num>, the loss on <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> to be sold would be <num value="275000000">two hundred and seventy-five millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It would therefore require at least bonds to the amount of <num value="1350">thirteen hundred and fifty</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> to produce sufficient currency to carry us to the end of the next fiscal year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/><date value="1863-06-30">30th June, 1863.</date> The sum is too frightful to be tolerated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> This is the language of an Administration man, a prominent Pennsylvanian, a hot advocate of the war. It is their own statement of their own case by the oracles of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>They confess that it will require the issue of <num value="1350">thirteen hundred and fifty</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars to pay the present floating debt of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and to carry on the war till <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> of next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The aggregate Federal date will thus be, taking in the old debt, and the <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> sold of the debt authorized last summer, <num value="1650">sixteen hundred and fifty</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> This amount results from estimating expenses at the rate of <num value="2000000">two millions</num> a day, but it is well known that these expenses are near <num value="3000000">three millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The probabilities are, therefore, that, instead of the <date value="1863-07-01">1st of July, 1863,</date> finding them with a debt of <num value="1650">sixteen hundred and fifty</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>, it will find them with a least <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>, failing as a charge of <num value="120000000">one hundred and twenty millions</num> annually to the account of taxation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> The bill now just passed imposes a tax of <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num>, and makes every man who has a debt due him or property to sell to receive payment in Government notes, which <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,William,J.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> thinks must go down to <measure n="60cents" type="currency">sixty cents</measure> in the dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>It remains to be seen what effect these measures will have upon the pocket nerve of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>We now see why their leaders are so anxious for early victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>They want to exhilarate and tickle the people while they rob them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> Does the <rs>South</rs> want to take a hand in paying this lag debt, and subjecting herself to this heavy taxation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>If so, she has but to fold her arms and submit to subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>If her pride did not rouse her to resistance, her interests do. Submission would not only be degradation, it would be utter and everlasting ruin. </p> </div3>

<head>Evils of excessive confidence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> It can scarcely be doubted that an excess of courage and confidence is sometimes more dangerous to a cause than an excess of cowardice and despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The South is suffering at this moment from a terrible apathy, begotten in part by the natural indifference of her people to danger, by a perilous contempt of her enemy, whom it has been the fashion to represent as so many <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName>, and by an uninterrupted succession of the most extraordinary victories from Big Bethel to <placeName key="tgn,7013272" n="1.000 6" reg="allegheny, pennsylvania, united states">Allegheny</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It seems almost incredible, yet it is none the less true, that up to the very period when the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> was reported as coming up the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, there was not a single gun of any kind mounted on either bank of the river; not <num value="1">one</num> fortification, masked battery, or even torpedo, and, if we are not mistaken, it was full <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> after that time before the slightest effort was made to defend a stream which could be as easily ascended &mdash; however difficult it might be to get back &mdash; as some of those the enemy have already attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It was a comparatively late period in the war, before even the city of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> manifested the slightest indication of preparing proper fortifications for its defence, a fact which so impressed <num value="1">one</num> of our distinguished city clergymen, on a visit to that place, that he felt compelled to call attention to it from the pulpit.--It is absolutely astounding to think of the apathy which for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> after the beginning of the war left our cause in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> at the mercy of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>We do not speak of the public authorities: for, as soon as the despotic designs of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> became evident, the <rs>Governor</rs> and <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Convention of Virginia</orgName> and the people strained every nerve to put the <name>Common</name> wealth in a state of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>But it was impossible, at that time, to resist successfully an advance of the enemy either by the line of the <rs>Potomac</rs> or the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and the people could not be made to realize their danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Their very courage and patriotism lifted them to high above the atmosphere of apprehension that they could not see the necessity of taking precautions against perils which seemed only to exist in limit imaginations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> From the very beginning of the war by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> upon the death, this journal has founded the note of <unclear></unclear> and that <unclear></unclear> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> pose it to the imputation of an alarmist &mdash; an imputation which we did not heed if we could only awaken the community to a sense of their danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Over and over again, from the beginning of this war, have we invoked attention to the defences of the <rs>James</rs> and <rs>York</rs>, and to a proper system of fortification for <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; not <num value="1">one</num> alone, in the immediate envious of the city, but beyond, in those admirable localities marked out by the circuit of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and which we can name at least <num value="1">one</num> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> engineer, familiar from his childhood with every foot of the soil, who could locate in the most efficient manner.--Nor have we been able to appreciate the favorite idea, that our enemy is a mere <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> man, who has no fight in him; a Shanghai, who cannot stand up against the smallest game-cock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>We have repeatedly pointed out the fallacy of this dangerous delusion, and endeavored to show from the authority of our own gallant soldiers that their enemy was not the pusillanimous for they had been described; or, if they were, it was no glory to rout them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The truth, we believe to be, that <num value="1">one</num> Southern man, fighting for his own fireside, is a match for any <num value="3">three</num> invaders; and that, besides, the <rs>South</rs> is a more military people in its instincts and aptitudes than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, or any other nation, except, perhaps, the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>Spanish</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>But to deny all courage and stamina to the entire <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> race, is as impolitic as it is unjust &mdash; unjust to our own soldiers, whose victories, if gained over a race of cowards, are not worth boasting of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> If the recent disaster to our arms, inflicted by superior numbers, shall have the effect of arousing the <rs>Southern</rs> people to the sense of a real and imminent danger, they will prove blessings instead of disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Everything that we hold is at stake in this war. We have an enemy so cruel and remorseless that the whole civilized world has held up its hands in horror at his inhumanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He brings with his armies handcuffs and halters, as well as bail and steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>What Southern man will hesitate to prefer the latter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>He threatens the ruin of our homes and firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Who will not rejoice to die in their defence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The sky is brightened with the flames of our burning towns; the soil soaked with the blood of our children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> programme, as just developed by the fiendish <persName n="Lane,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lane</surname></persName>, is perfectly appalling in its wickedness and cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We know what is in store for us if we are subjugated; and now that the danger is at the door, we must do or die. The public spirit is up; the hour of destiny is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Woe to the leader who now commits a blunder of commission or commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The battle commenced about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>, and lasted till <time value="1:30oclock">half-past 1 o'clock</time>.--There was no way for the enemy to advance except in the face of the battery, as the road was skirted on either side by a marsh; and no attempt was made at a charge until our ammunition gave out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The Blues were on the left of the battery, and the <rs>McCulloch Rangers</rs> on the right; and being thus exposed, these companies suffered more than the others, which were either behind the battery or in reserve.--Even after the ammunition was exhausted, our men had no idea of surrendering, until the order for retreat was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>A council of officers was held, and the conclusion was very reluctantly arrived at, that as there was no means of escape from the island, nor any use to contend longer, without ammunition, against an overpowering force, it would be best to take the chances of a Federal prison, and they accordingly marched down and surrendered. </p>
