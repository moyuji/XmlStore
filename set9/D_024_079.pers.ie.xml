<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>He has been making a speech in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, full of the usual platitudes of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the greatest pleasures we have enjoyed since our separation from those interesting foreigners, the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, is hearing very little of the dear people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It is only when some old political stagers, some veteran political place-hunter, like <persName n="Crittenden,,John,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="default:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, obtrudes himself upon our vision, that we are reminded of the nauseating fisttery which were periodically heaped upon the sources of power and patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Here is <persName n="Crittenden,,John,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="default:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, now an old man, with <num value="1">one</num> foot in the grave, soon to appear at the tribunal of the <name>Great Judge</name>, uttering the same detestable nonsense and falsehood that he has bought his way with from youth to the present hour, chartering truth and self respect for a beggarly mess of political pottage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>When <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> says &#x0022;we have a wise people,&#x0022; he tells that which he knows not to be true, which he knows to be the very opposite of truth, and which all experience disproves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>In what way have the people shown their wisdom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>In what way did they ever show it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Did they prove it in the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to the <name>Presidency</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>For the last quarter of a century no man of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate abilities had the remotest chance of being elected <rs type="role2">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.-- <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="mostcommon:Clay,nomatch:0"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, could not come within gunshot of the <name>Presidency</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>It was enough to ruin a man before the &#x0022;wise people&#x0022; to be suspected of having more brains than themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Great, lofty intellects, combined with good, moral natures that disdained to flatter them, and always told them the truth, were not the men for the people's money. --If a great statesman undertook to set himself in the way of the popular passions they swept him away where he was never heard of again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It was only old political courtesan like <persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> and other experienced prostitutes that could always command the popular favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>They had only to talk about the &#x0022;wise people,&#x0022; and &#x0022;believing in the people, &#x0022; and their fortune was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>How disgusting all this seems to us now as we stand amid the surges and wrecks of a war brought about by the arts of politicians playing upon popular credulity, ignorance, and passion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>We hope in our new country never to hear these nauseating flatteries of popular intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>If the demagogue is to do his work here as he has elsewhere we know the consequences &mdash; the final and complete failure of the last <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> experiment in the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> We have never doubted the patriotism of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> or any other country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It requires no intelligence or knowledge to be patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>When did that wise people show their wisdom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>In electing the worst men in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> members of Congress and members of the <name>Legislatures</name>; in short, in filling every elective office &mdash; and every office was elective &mdash; with the most incompetent and dishonest men that could be found?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Or did they demonstrate their transcendent intelligence in inaugurating the most foolish war, to say nothing of its wickedness, that is recorded in the annals of history?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Yet <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> says that he believes in the people!
