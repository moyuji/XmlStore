<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Your favor of the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">first inst.</day></dateStruct>, by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Randolph,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,J.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>,</hi> came safe to hand &mdash; the merits of this young gentleman, added to your recommendation and my own knowledge of his character, induced me to take him into my family as an <rs type="role" reg="Aide de camp">Aide-de-camp</rs>, in the room of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Mifflin,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Mifflin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mifflin</surname></persName>,</hi> who I have appointed <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster General</rs>, from a thorough persuasion of his integrity, my own experience of his activity, and finally, because he stands unconnected with either of these Governments; or with this, that, or other man; for, between you and I, there is more in this than you can easily imagine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> As we have new nearly completed our lines of defence, we have nothing more, in my opinion, to fear from the enemy, provided we can keep our men to their duty, and make them watchful and vigilant; but it is among the most difficult tasks I ever undertook in my life to induce these people to believe that there is or can be danger, till the bayonet is pushed at their breasts; not that it proceeds from any uncommon prowess, but rather from an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people, which, believe me, prevails but too generally among the officers of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> part of the army, who are nearly of the same kidney with the privates, and adds not a little to my difficulties, as there is no such thing as getting officers of this stamp to exert themselves in carrying orders into execution.--To curry favor with the men (by whom they were chosen, and on whose smiles possibly they may think they may again rely,) seems to be <num value="1">one</num> of the principal objects of their attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I submit it, therefore, to your consideration, whether there is, or is not, a propriety in that resolution of the <rs>Congress</rs> which leaves the ultimate appointment of all officers below the rank of General to the <name>Governments</name> where the regiments originated, now the army is become Continental?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>To me, it appears improper in <num value="2">two</num> points of view--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it is giving that power and weight to an individual Colony which ought of right to belong to the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Then it damps the spirit and ardor of volunteers from all but the <num value="4">four</num> <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Governments, as none but their people have the least chance of getting into office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Would it not <unclear></unclear> better, therefore, to have the warrants which the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> is authorized to give <hi rend="italics">pro tempore,</hi> approved or disapproved by the <orgName n="Continental Congress" type="congress">Continental Congress</orgName>, or a committee of their body, which I should suppose in any long recess must always set?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>In this case, every gentleman will stand an equal chance of being promoted, according to his merit; in the other, all offices will be confined to the inhabitants of the <num value="4">four</num> <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Governments, which, in my opinion, is impolitic to a degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>I have made a pretty good slam among such kind of officers as the <rs>Massachusetts Government</rs> abounds in since I came to this camp, having broken <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> and <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Captains</rs> for cowardly behavior in the action on <placeName reg="Banker's Hill">Banker's Hill</placeName>, <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Captains</rs> for drawing more provisions and pay than they had men in their company, and <num value="1">one</num> for being absent from his post when the enemy appeared there and burnt a house just log it. Besides these, I have at this time <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, and <num value="2">two</num> subalterns under arrest for trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>In short, I spare none, and yet fear it will not all do, as these people seem to be too inattentive to everything but their <hi rend="italics">interest.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> I have not been unmindful of that part of your letter respecting <placeName reg="Point Allerton, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1011564">Point Alderton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Before the receipt of it, it had become an object of my particular inquiry; but the accounts of its situation differ exceedingly in respect to the command it has of the hip channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>But my knowledge of this matter would not have been confined to inquiries only if I had ever been in a condition, since my arrival here, to have taken possession of such a post; but you well know, my good sir, that it becomes the duty of an officer to consider some other matters as well as situation, <unclear></unclear> rely: what number of men are necessary to defend a place; how it can be supported, and how furnished with ammunition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> In respect to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I conceive our defence of this place, (<placeName reg="Point Aldertons">Point Aldertons</placeName>,) must be proportioned to the attack of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Gage,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Gage,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Gage</surname></persName>'s</hi> whole force, leaving him just enough to man his lines on <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and Charlestown Necks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>And with regard to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <unclear></unclear> important, as well as alarming object, we have only <measure n="184barrels" type="mass">184 barrels</measure> of power in all, (including the late supply from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>,) which is not sufficient to give <num value="25">25</num> musket cartridges to each man, and scarcely to serve the artillery in any brisk action <num value="1">one</num> single day. Under these circumstances, I dare say you will agree with me that it would not be very eligible to take a post <measure n="30miles" type="distance">30 miles distant</measure>, (by land,) from this place, when we have already a line of communication round <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> of at least <measure n="10miles" type="distance">10 miles</measure> in extent to defend, any part of which may be attacked without our having (if the enemy will keep their own counsel,) an hour's previous notice of it, and that it would not <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> be prudent in me to attempt a measure which would necessarily bring on a consumption of all the ammunition we have, thereby leaving the army at the mercy of the enemy, or to disperse and the country to be ravaged and laid waste at discretion.--To you, sir, I may account for my conduct; but I cannot declare the motives of it to everyone, notwithstanding I know, by not doing it, that I shall stand in a very unfavorable light in the opinion of those who expect much, and will find little done, without understanding, or perhaps giving themselves the trouble of inquiring into the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Such, however, is the fate of all those who are obliged to act the part I do. I must, therefore, submit to it, under a consciousness of having done my duty to the best of my abilities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> last, we took possession of a hill advanced of our own lines, and within point blank shot of the enemy on Charlestown Neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>We worked incessantly the whole night with <num value="1200">1,200</num> men, and before morning got an entrenchment in such forwardness as to bid defiance to their cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> on Sunday they began a heavy cannonade, which continued through the day without any injury to our work, and with the loss of <num value="4">four</num> men only, <num value="2">two</num> of which were killed through their own folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The insult of the cannonade, however, we were obliged to submit to with impunity, not daring to make use of artillery, on account of the consumption of powder, except with <num value="1">one</num> <num value="9">nine</num>-pounder, placed on a point, with which we silenced, and indeed, sunk, <num value="1">one</num> of their <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName>.--This move of ours was made to prevent the enemy from gaining this hill, and we thought was giving them a fair challenge to dispute it, (as we had been told by various people, who had just left <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, that they were preparing to come out;) but, instead of accepting of it, we learn that it has thrown them into great consternation, which might be improved had we the means of doing it. Yesterday afternoon they began a bombardment, without any effect as yet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> There have been so many great and capital errors and abuses to rectify &mdash; so many examples to make, and so little inclination in the officers of interior rank to contribute their aid to accomplish this work, that my life has been nothing else (since I came here,) but <num value="1">one</num> continual round of vexation and fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In short, no pecuniary recompense could induce me to undergo what I have; especially, as I expect, by showing so little countenance to irregularities and public abuses as to render myself very obnoxious to a great part of these people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>But as I have already greatly exceeded the bounds of a letter, I will not trouble you with matters relative to my own feelings. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He goes, as plainly as it is possible for a man who has of late shown himself so willfully blind to all the signs of the times, the hand-writing on the wall, and he knows the days of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> empire to be numbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>These developments sound the death note of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> supremacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> What, however, after all, do we learn, but what every man of souse in <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> saw or ought to have seen, from the very commencement of this struggle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Did the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, for <num value="1">one</num> moment, suppose that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was going to assist them in subduing the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Were they not aware that <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> know, as well as any man in Yankeedom, from what quarter came all those producer which formed the basis of her enormous trade with <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Did they not know that <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> has been for years endeavoring to break the shackles which Yankeedom imposed upon this commerce, and that she had never succeeded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Did they suppose that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would assist them to subdue us, merely that she might be enabled to receive her supplies only through <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ports, with all the additional cost incurred by transportation to those ports?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Did they presume that <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> was desirous to remain forever debarred from all participation in the enormous coasting trade, to which, by the independence of these States she would have access on the same terms with Yankeedom themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Did they suppose that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was altogether insensible to the value of that enormous Southern market, which her goods can now only reach through <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ports?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>In a word, did they conceive <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to be totally bereft of her senses, as it is very evident that Yankeedom is?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>If Yankeedom conceived none of these things, for what did it suppose that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was going to take its part in this war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Was it for love?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Why, the hostility of Yankeedom to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has been proverbial ever since the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, when its friendship was palpable enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> loves treason, and he took up for <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the war indicated because it was treason to do so. But ever since that day he has been bitterly hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Whenever he has had the power of shaping the policy of the <rs>General Government</rs>, that policy, in its foreign relations, seems to have been confined to acts which might annoy the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The nigger and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.--These have been the only subjects on which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has had any policy for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>In the meantime, the ribaldry of the New York press whenever <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has been concerned, has been a disgrace to civilization.--Even now, when the very existence of the <rs>Government</rs> depends upon the negotiation of a loan in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Tribune,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi>--all the New York press &mdash; daily insult and vilify the <rs>British</rs> nation Yankeedom could not expect <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to assist her for love. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> In the meantime, the necessities of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> demand free access to the ports of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, to take and carry away the cotton crop, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> </hi> has taught that necessity has no law. How, then, could the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--Government and people &mdash; ever expect anything else than that which they see nigh at band?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>How could they flatter themselves that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>--having the power, and, as it now appears, the will into the bargain &mdash; would ever hesitate between rebellion among her own subjects and a rupture of the blockade? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> It is very evident that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName></hi> is desirous to have <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Russell,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Russell</surname></persName></hi> mobbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>On the contrary, he has said all against, us that he could say.

But we doubt very much whether <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName></hi> would approve of such a summary <unclear>pro seling </unclear> and we do not see that it would assist the proposed loan very materially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The fact is, if <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Russell,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Russell</surname></persName></hi> had told a lie about the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, he would have been in no danger but the truth is more than they can stomach. </p>
