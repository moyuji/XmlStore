<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Never, we assert with the utmost confidence, was there known a people so able in public affairs, so heroic so brave, so prudent, so devoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Whatever may be the issue of this war, planters and slaveowners have raised up by their deeds an imperishable monument of their greatness and magnanimity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> In little more than a month they extemporized and matured a Government, a Constitution, a Legislature, social authority, that have stood the test of the most critical experiment with triumphant success, and are more workable, consistent, stable, and free, than the institutions they disowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> In early times it was not unusual for the <name>Popes</name> to excommunicate whole national but as in many of these instances those who were excommunicated denied the papal authority, the effect produced was nugatory, and the practice fell into disuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It has now, however, been renewed in another form in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, finding his authority waning, even where it is still nominally recognized, has determined to vindicate it where it is entirely ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He has failed to subjugate the <rs>Southern States</rs> by his legions, and in his extremity has decided on effecting his purpose by a scratch of his pen. On and after <date value="1863-01-01">the 1st day of January, 1863,</date> he decrees that the <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of slaves at present kept in subjection in the <rs>Southern States</rs> shall be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>On reading his proclamation <num value="1">one</num> can only regret that so serious and powerful an Abolitionist should have seen fit to limit the sphere of operation of such unparalleled beneficence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> It is scarcely possible to treat seriously of this singular manifesto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>If not genuine, the composition would be entitled to no little praise as a piece of matchless irony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The accuracy with which the details are particularized is faultless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Rebellion, like treason, is very difficult of definition, and the <rs>President</rs> consequently assuages the fears in such States as might be apprehensive of being erroneously supposed to be rebellious, though in fact loyal, by laying down an easy and intelligible test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/><q>&#x0022;Any State, or the people thereof, which shall, on <date value="01-01">January 1,</date> be in good faith represented in the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Every slave will thus become a free man. Deprived of slave labor, the <rs>Southern</rs> planters will find their energies paralyzed, if they are not themselves annihilated by the emancipated serfs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The war will cease, and the <rs>Union</rs> be once more restored in its pristine integrity, but cleansed of that foul stain which here afore made it the reproach of Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>At length the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> question has been finally and satisfactorily solved. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A few weeks since, trembling for the safety of its capital &mdash; at the present moment unable to force a passage into its enemy's territory &mdash; it still takes upon itself to dispose of property which it is powerless to seize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>According to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Constitution, the local Legislature of each State possesses the sole power of emancipating the slaves within its continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has long since discontinued the antiquated custom of acting according to law. There are few, however, even of those who have manifested the greatest disregard for the laws they have sworn to administer, who have not been more or less sensitive of ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>A man may brave the passions of an angry mob, but he does not like exposing himself to be laughed at.--<persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> seemingly cares as little for the ridicule as he does for the anger of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.--He must be well aware that his proclamation will prove a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">brutum fulmen.</hi></foreign> <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, not many months since, in a moment of Abolitionist zeal, emancipated all the slaves in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>; but, to the surprise of everybody, the slaves paid no attention to his proclamation, and worked away harder than ever in throwing up those fortifications which insured the subsequent repulse of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Liberty, we should have supposed, would recommend itself, if at all to a slave, by its intrinsic excellence, and that the mode of manumission would be regarded with indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> While providing prospectively for the future the present is not neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> may confine in prison for an indefinite time any person he chooses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It is sufficient to allege that the accused has been guilty of rebellion, or has opposed the enforced levy of soldiers, to deprive him of his right to demand a trial for the alleged offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Such is the existing state of things in New York, in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.--cities far removed from the seat of war. Such is the liberty enjoyed by the free citizens of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The measure was, we suppose, deemed necessary by the <rs>President</rs> in consequence of the invitation lately given by the <rs>Governors</rs> of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> to those of the other States to meet and deliberate on public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Such a meeting would undoubtedly be construed into an act of rebellion, and we suppose that the <rs>President</rs> intends to arrest the refractory Governors.--The several States, however, value their individual independence even more than they do the integrity of the <rs>Union</rs>, and it is far from likely that they would tamely permit their Governors to be sent to prison in compliance with the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.--The proclamation of martial law throughout the <rs>Federal States</rs> has been prompted, not by Confederate aggression, but by domestic insecurity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>War has been declared between the <rs>Federal</rs> government and its acknowledged subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The proclamation emancipating the slaves is evidently a bait thrown out to gain the support of the <name>Abolitionist</name> party.--It will prove useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> Even in this crisis of the war, the most important part of the last intelligence refers to a political, not a military, movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>He has played his last card.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He has declared by a proclamation that in all the <name>States</name> that shall not have returned to the <rs>Union</rs> on the <date value="01-01">1st of January</date> the slaves shall, after that date, be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It is a political concession to the <name>Abolitionist</name> <q>&#x0022;wing&#x0022;</q> of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>When the <rs>Union</rs> existed, its Constitution gave no right, either to the <rs>President</rs> alone or to the <rs>President</rs> and Congress combined, to abolish slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The Abolitionists assume that the war has conferred the right; emancipation was a <q>&#x0022;thunderbolt placed in the hands&#x0022;</q> of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, with which to destroy the <rs>South</rs> and all its social organization at a blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He has accepted the assumed right, and launched the thunderbolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>But he is without the power to enforce the decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The <rs>North</rs> must conquer every square mile of the <rs>Southern States</rs> before it can make the proclamation more than waste paper &mdash; The policy that has dictated the proclamation is very doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Nothing was needed to deepen the hatred of the <rs>South</rs>; but, if anything could determine it to continue the war to the last extremity, it is this decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> already denounce it as unconstitutional; the moderate <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> condemn it as a measure that can have no practical result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>It will have no effect on the <rs>South</rs>, which has long acted as against an Abolitionist Government of the <rs>North</rs>, and anticipated all it can do by any kind of legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>In the <rs>North</rs> itself it is likely to be only another element of confusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> By the <name>Abolitionists</name> however, it is held to be a short and easy mode of compelling a peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time both sides give utterance to the word, though the tone in which they pronounce it differs considerably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>In the <orgName n="Southern Congress" type="congress">Southern Congress</orgName> a resolution has been or is to be proposed, to the effect that the success of the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms justifies the <rs>Government</rs> in <q> &#x0022;sending commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to propose the terms of a just and honorable peace. &#x0022;</q> This, at least, contemplates an end to the struggle by a settlement, the terms of which are to be discussed during a suspension of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>As the <rs>South</rs> shows no inability to continue the war, the offer is reasonable and temperate.--The statesman should stand behind the soldier, or war itself is a miserable and purposeless blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The Northern Government also contemplates peace, but in a most singular manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Exactly when its military and political powers are most broken, it threatens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It continues to refuse all recognition of existing facts, and clings to constitutional and legal fictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It insists that the storm of war has swept away nothing, and offers, on certain conditions, to ignore the war itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>In about <q>&#x0022;<measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>&#x0022;</q> hence, or on <date value="01-01">the 1st of January, </date> any State returning representatives, as heretofore, to the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>, shall, <q> &#x0022;in the absence of strong countervailing testimony,&#x0022;</q> he considered as not having revolted at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>No legal fiction can make such testimony as this of no effect.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The proclamation is evidently nothing more that a compound of <q>&#x0022;bunkum&#x0022;</q> on a grand scale, with the swaggering bravado so conspicuous throughout the present war. We have no doubt the <rs>President</rs> sincerely desires the extinction, of slavery, but he has himself told us that there is a thing he desires more; and in his address to the border States he made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It a topic of piteous complaint that, unless they came to his help, he should be obliged to yield to the pressure of the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The proclamation is in <num value="1">one</num> sense a cop thrown to those unreasoning fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>But it is also a blustering menace to the <rs>South</rs>--a threat that if the seceding States do not return within the time of grace, and so disappoint the hopes of their bitter foes, the latter shall enjoy the gratification of seeing them involved in all the horrors of a servile war. Doubtless the <rs>South</rs> will laugh at the idle menace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>In its territories <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has no authority except in the few spots occupied by his troops, and experience has already shown that the slaves have no notion of accepting his invitation to rise against their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>But the harmlessness of the proclamation does not axenic its utter want of principle, and if its concocters expected it to produce a favorable impression in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, there is <num value="1">one</num> simple answer to them.--it is too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>But then the <rs>Border States</rs> would have been lost, and the civil war might have extended to the <rs>North</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> experienced the proverbial fate attending an attempt to sit upon <num value="2">two</num> stools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It is now too late for him to make a choice, and on the strength of it to claim the respect of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>And his new proclamation does not even announce a choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>It still leaves the door open for a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, without the slightest practical effort to reduce the power of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>It is impossible not to feel that if the <rs>South</rs> offered to return at once on being assured of the permanence of its favorite institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The fact that his proclamation once more brings forward that scheme of negro colonization, which was denounced with such indignant eloquence in a letter we lately transferred to these columns, will not make it more potable in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<p>
