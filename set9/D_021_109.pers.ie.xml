<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>,</hi> <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tenn.</placeName>, <date value="1862-04-16">April 16, 1862.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> This war has given to history some of the brightest and noblest instances of personal heroism that ever illuminated the proud annals of a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>There is a <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name> animating the mass &mdash; a spirit of pure, unselfish patriotism; but there is a greater still, which lives alone in the souls of age, than throbs in the restless impulses of youth &mdash; a spirit which speaks with a voice of thunder amid the din of battle, and yet becomes a Christian halo around the bed of suffering and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>the world does not always see and recognise the inspiration until the honored possessor has slipped the cables of life, and been borne beyond the reach of everything but memory and tears. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> These thoughts are suggested by an incident which was related to me by <persName n="Keller,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Keller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Keller</surname></persName>, of this city, concerning apart <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> of age, named <persName n="Jackson,,Charlie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Jackson,Charlie,,,"><foreName>Charlie</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who was wounded in the recent battle, and is now lying hopelessly at the point of death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Some months ago his father raised a company in which <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> was permitted to drill with the privates, and finally became so expert in the manual of arms that, young as he was, he was chosen the drill-master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In due time, marching orders were received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Then, the father consulting the age of his boy, and probably his own paternal feelings, gave him to understand that it was his wish he should remain at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>To this <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> strenuously demurred, and plainly told his parent that if he could not go with him he would join another company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Yielding to his obstinacy, a sort of silent consent was given, and the dad left <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> with his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The regiment to which they belonged was detached to <placeName reg="Burnsville, Tishomingo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056069">Burnsville</placeName>, several miles distant from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, and here it remained until the <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> or <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> preceding the battle &mdash; Orders were then received that it should repair at once to the field and take its position, <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> was asleep at the time of the departure and the father, unwilling that <num value="1">one</num> so young should undergo the fatigues of the long march of <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure>, and the dangers of the coming fight, gave orders that he should not be disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Several hours after the boy awoke of his own account. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> At a glance, his eye took in the condition of affairs, and his knowledge of coming events satisfied him of the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>With him to think was to act. He seized his little gun &mdash; a miniature musket which his father had made for him, and alone started on the trail of his absent regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Hour after hour he trudged along, and finally as they were just about halting preparatory to going into battle, he succeeded in joining his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>His father chided him, but how could he do otherwise than admire the indomitable spirit of his boy. The battle commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> took his place by his father's side, and was soon in the thickest of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>A bullet struck him in the body and tore an ugly wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Still he pressed on firing, charring and charging with the remainder of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He seemed not to know the sensation of fear, and his youthful example on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion was the rallying point from which the men took fresh spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Suddenly, at a late hour in the day, the little fellow fell shot through the leg a few inches below the hip &mdash; He gave a cheer and told his father to go on. &#x0022;Don't mind me!&#x0022; said he, &#x0022;but keep on; I'll lay here till you come back&#x0022; This, of course, the feelings of the parent would not permit him to do, and picking him up in his arms, he carried him to the nearest hospital within a day or <num value="2">two</num> <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> was brought to his home in <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, feeble, yet full of hope and courage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <persName n="Keller,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Keller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Keller</surname></persName> was called upon to examine the wound, and, if necessary, to perform amputation; but at a glance his experienced eye saw that the poor boy was beyond the hope of recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Mortification had set in, and an operation would only increase his sufferings without prolonging life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The lad noticed the sober countenance of the physician as he turned away, and went to an adjoining room to break the mournful intelligence to the weeping father and mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Nothing could be done but to relieve him of pain by means of opiates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A few moments afterwards he returned to the bedside of the sufferer, when the young hero abruptly met him with the question-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> &#x0022;<rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>, will you answer me a straightforward question, and tell me the truth?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> The physician paused a moment, and then said: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> &#x0022;Yes, <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName>, I will, but you must prepare for bad news.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The physician"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> &#x0022;Can I live?&#x0022; was the response. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> &#x0022;No!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>No thing can save you now but a miracle from Heaven.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> &#x0022;Well, I have thought so myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I have felt as if I was going to die. Do father and mother know this?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> &#x0022;Yes,&#x0022; replied the surgeon,&#x0022; I have just told them.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> &#x0022;Please ask them to come in here.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> When the parents had done so, and taken their places on either side of the bed, <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName> reached out, grasped their hands in his, and said: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> &#x0022;Dear father and mother, <persName n="Keller,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Keller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Keller</surname></persName> says that I can't live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>And now I want to ask your forgiveness for all wrong I have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I have tried to be a good boy in every way but <num value="1">one</num>, and that was when I disobeyed you both and joined the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I couldn't help that, for I felt as if I ought to be right where you were, father, and to fight as long as I was able.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I'm only sorry that I can't fight through the war. If I have said anything wrong or done anything wrong, won't you forgive me?&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Charlie"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The afflicted parents could only weep their assent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> &#x0022;Now, father,&#x0022; continued the boy, &#x0022;<num value="1">One</num> thing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Don't stay here with me, but go back to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Mother will take care of me, and your services are more necessary in your company than they are at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>I am not afraid to die; and I wish I had a <num value="1000">thousand</num> lives to lose in the same way. And, father, tell the boys when you get back how I died &mdash; just as a soldier ought to. Tell them to fight the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> as long as there is <num value="1">one</num> left in the country, and never give up!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Tell them, too, to kill just as many as they think will avenge the death of <persName><foreName>Charlie</foreName></persName>; and whenever you fill up the company with new men let them know that besides their country there's a little boy in heaven who will watch them and pray for them as they go into battle.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> And so is dying <num value="1">one</num> of the bravest spirits that was ever breathed into the human body by its Divine Maker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The scene I have described is <num value="1">one</num> of which we sometimes read, but rarely behold, and the <rs>Surgeon</rs> told me that inured as he was to spectacles of suffering and was, as he stood by this, a silent spectator, his heart overflowed in tears and he knelt down and sobbed like a child. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> How true are the lines of the post-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> &#x0022;The good die <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> And they whose hearts are dry as summer's dust, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> Burn to the socket&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Another similar incident has been related to me by a Captain in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Kentucky</rs> regiments concerning the dying moments of <persName n="Holbrook,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Holbrook,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut. Col.</roleName> <surname>Holbrook</surname></persName>, his superior officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> I make no apology for these narrations <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because they are a port of history and deserve a place upon its noblest page; and secondly, because there are touches of nature in them, which must find a response in the heart of every reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>They are illustrious examples of living and dying patriotism, which every Southern soldier may well strive to emulate in his perilous career to glory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> <persName n="Holbrook,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Holbrook,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut. Col.</roleName> <surname>Holbrook</surname></persName> was severely wounded in <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> places; in <num value="1">one</num> mortally, but he fell at the head of his regiment in <num value="1">one</num> of its proudest moments &mdash; a victorious charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He was conveyed at once to the hospital, and there learned that his injuries were of a mortal character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>After the battle several of his officers paid him a visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They found life fast ebbing, though he was still able to converse He desired to be propped up in bed, and then he talked to them like a Christian soldier. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The secret seems to have been well kept to the last moment, and the effect of its publication, we can readily imagine, must have been electric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> surprise was over, and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> mind had time to look through the imposing grandeur of the scheme propounded, to its practical object, many doubts and some suspicions must have arisen as to the reality of its aim. Our Transatlantic cousins have the true nobility of Republicanism, and they are not strangers to those great impulses which sometimes alter the destiny of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It is natural to expect, therefore, that a glow of enthusiasm may have kindled in the breasts of some <num value="1000000">millions</num> of Northerners when this prospect of concluding a fratricidal strife by a noble act of self-sacrifice opened upon them, and that even when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blush of excitement is past there will still be found men ready to approve and carry out the <rs>President</rs>'s policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>But let us look calmly at this tremendous project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is a proposition to buy up <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of slaves, at a cost to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of some &#x00A3;<num value="400000000">400,000,000</num> or &#x00A3;<unclear><num value="00000000">00,000,000</num></unclear> sterling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They could not comprehend the unheard-of generosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>They sought for some <hi rend="italics">carriers peaces </hi> to explain it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Multiply this &#x00A3;<num value="30000000">30,000,000</num> by <num value="40">40</num>, conceive a Government utterly bankrupt, afraid to impose a heavy taxation, and engaged in the costliest war that was ever waged, proposing this prospective expenditure as a means of reconstructing the <rs>Union</rs>, terminating the war, and at the same time abolishing slavery as an institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The world may stand against at the very conception of such a sacrifice, and prudence compels us to be chary of our approval, however much the originality of the design may command our admiration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> Is the <rs>President</rs> in earnest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Does he really propose this gigantic measure as a solution of all the difficulties which are now overwhelming the <rs>Government</rs> and the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; or does he put it forward as a device to detach the border States from the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and to gain for the <rs>North</rs> the sympathies of the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>His mode of introducing it is cautious in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Its operation is to be gradual; the scheme is only initiatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But its application is universal; every slaveholder in the <rs>South</rs> is to be invited to get rid of his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>All the <name>States</name> in common are to co-operate and form a common fund to buy up his &#x0022;human chatties&#x0022; at a fair valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It seems to us that the greatest danger to the success of the proposition would be its immediate acceptance by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>This is obviously not contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It is a gradual process that is desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>But whether is be effected in <num value="1">one</num> year or <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, the sum which it will cost will not be diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>In fact, the longer it is delayed the costlier will be the redemption; and, for the sake of the reconstructed Union, if it is to be resoldered, the sooner the purchase is completed the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Where, then, is the purchase-money to come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>From taxation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>But the sources of taxation are already dried up. <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> are impoverished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>And it requires more faith in human nature, and especially Transatlantic human nature, than we possess, to believe that, for the sake of emancipating the &#x0022;niggers,&#x0022; and placing <num value="1000000">millions</num> of acres in the <rs>Southern States</rs> on a per with the desolated plantations of our <rs n="West Indian" type="location">West Indian</rs> colonies, the population of the <rs>North</rs> will undergo such a burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The hope of raising a sufficient fund by taxation is plainly fallacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>It must be obtained by loans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>But the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> have no money to lend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The Government have no adequate security to offer even to native capitalists, and the idea of borrowing anything like the sums required from foreign sources cannot be seriously entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But, supposing the capital to be forthcoming, could is be so applied with success?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Would the offer to purchase the slaves at a fair price bring back the <rs>South</rs> into the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The whole weight of evidence is against such a supposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It is not in the midst of a strite such as is now wracking the <rs>South</rs> with fire and sword that the voice of conciliation will be listened to. And, we believe, if the question of slavery could, by any possibility, be eliminated from the problem now pressing for solution in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, the <rs>South</rs> would still remain as resolute in its hostility to any reunion with the <rs>Northern States</rs> as it was <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago. No doubt slavery lies at the bottom of the deadly hate of these <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>But it is not for their slaves that the <rs>South</rs> is now fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We believe, then, that <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s project is not feasible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The <rs>North</rs> cannot, the <rs>South</rs> will not, accept it. Both sides will, we believes, regard it as a dishonoring compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>By the <rs>North</rs> it will be looked upon as a humiliating concession in the hour of victory; by the <rs>South</rs> as a <hi rend="italics">ruse </hi> to detach the border States, to create disunion in its councils, and to pave the way for its subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> There is no mistaking the alternative the <rs>President</rs> offers. &#x0022;War,&#x0022; he says, &#x0022;has been and continues to be, an indispensable means to the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>If resistance continues, the war must also continue, and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the ruin which may follow it: Such as may seem indispensable or may obviously promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle must and will come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The words are bold and the meaning is clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>If the <rs>South</rs> will not sell the slaves, the <rs>North</rs> will free them; a servile war is lately in contemplation, and the sanguinary anticipations of the <name>Abolitionists</name> may yet be fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The South, however, is not yet cowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It has made great sacrifices: it will make greater still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The resisting efforts which have been opposed to the conquering armies of the <rs>North</rs> in the border States will be redoubled in the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Flourishing towns may disappear, and the great garden of the <rs>South</rs> may be devastated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>But at the present hour there is no flinching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>What would the <rs>Union</rs> be worth, and how long would it last, if it could be reconstructed over the embers of a hatred so intense as that which animates the <rs>Southerner</rs> in his desperate struggle against the overwhelming odds brought against him? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Every town taken and every battle lost, darkens the picture, and in the nature of things, tends to multiply difficulties and to extend the field of suffering and blood through which we have to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>In the fall of New Orleans, we can see no positive or negative good, however remote which can possibly accrue to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and it would be an idle fancy which would affect to derive consolation from the fact, that the enemy's forces are weakened in other quarters, by the forces which are required to occupy and garrison it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It is <measure n="19years" type="date">nineteen years</measure> since Timbey's revolving steel or iron batteries were invented, models made, and all the details laid before our Government; and, it is <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> since they were communicated to the <rs>French Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The present model was finished in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> last, and is of itself a beautiful and demonstrative exhibition of the manner that harbor and other defensive positions must, before long be fortified, and thus rendered impassible to any foreign foe. The vertical sides are pierced for <num value="60">sixty</num> guns of any desirable calibre, and range of shot or shell arranged in <num value="3">three</num> tiers, and presenting the guns to the object singly; that is, but <num value="1">one</num> &#x0022;port&#x0022; in line of sight at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The whole superstructure, which is to be above ground, is made to turn on its vertical axis by a concealed steam power, say <num value="300">three hundred</num> horse engine; which engine is also to force hot or cold air through the casements for the benefit of the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The guns occupy galleries of equal height &mdash; in <num value="3">three</num> tiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>When the structure is put in motion, the whole number of guns will bear on the object every <measure n="2minutes" type="date">two minutes</measure>, if it only revolves at the rate of <measure n="150feet" type="distance">one hundred and fifty feet</measure> in a minute, or <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> speed of a man at an ordinary walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The officer in command takes his position in the top of the iron castle, where, under the upper dome, there is a narrow opening through which the light enters, and permits him to see out through a telescope, or theodolite, which instrument is fixed in position on a stand and platform, which platform moves by the hand of the commander &mdash; turning a slight wheel &mdash; on its vertical exist, independent of the moving of the castle by the motion of the steam-engine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The result is, that the operator, having determined by the micrometer of the theodolite the distance of the object to be hit outside the castle, telegraphs to each gunner the angle of elevation or depression, to act the guns, and all being loaded, he sets the castle in revolution by signal to the engineer; and when each gun falls into the same vertical line that held by the theodolite bearing on <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> the object, or target, the gun is at that instant fired by an electric spark which ignites the priming of each gun in turn, as it bears on the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>In a word, there will be a continuous stream of the heaviest metal discharged from the largest guns that can be made or used anywhere, at any object within range, and at any point of the compass, without the slightest possible danger or inconvenience to the persons who are to occupy the inside of the walls and dome of this mighty engine of war. </p> </q><bibl n="Philadelphia"></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>We have the utmost confidence in the skill and ability of our General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>We are well aware that he knows what is best to do, and that he will be sure to do whatever is best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We hope he will be left free and untrammeled, to carry out his own views, and to make his own campaign in his own way.--Far be from us the unpardonable presumption of even hinting what ought to be done, in a case where is so completely understands the subject, and we know so little of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> Nevertheless, we cannot forbear observing that where the enemy is so superior to us, in the number and range of his great guns, and in the completeness of his small arms, it would be the height of folly to allow the issue to be staked alone upon the use of fire-arms &mdash; This is especially the case in this instance, since the late example of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> has proved beyond question that the bayonet, in the hands of our troops, is a weapon which the enemy cannot withstand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>We beat him wherever we came in contact with him with that weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>He was unable to withstand a single <num value="1">one</num> of our charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>This fact speaks a whole volume of encouragement to our men. Whenever the long-range guns of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Annoy them without the possibility of retaliation, a charge with the bayonet will be sure to decide the debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The <rs>English</rs> and <orgName n="French infantry" type="infantry">French infantry</orgName> always charge a battery by which they are galled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>They never think of wasting ammunition in returning the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Our troops are brave enough, and they are sufficiently well disciplined to charge with the bravest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It would seem, that where a column charging is fired upon by a column in position, it ought to be annihilated before it could reach the firing column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>But experience has proved that such is never the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>On the contrary, the casualties are in general surprisingly small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>They are not nearly so great as when the <num value="2">two</num> columns stand and deliberately fire at each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Both parties instantly commenced such a deadly fire that in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> <num value="800">800</num> men were killed or wounded on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The fire was so furious that the officers could not be heard for a few moments, but as soon as they could make themselves understood, a charge was ordered, and the enemy routed at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>What the firing could not do, even with the loss of so many men, the bayonet did instantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It cleared the way for the <rs>French</rs>, who entered the redoubt by the rear without further opposition, for the defenders evacuated it as soon as they saw that they were tested. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Let us show him that he is mistaken &mdash; that we have something else besides spades and pickaxes to depend upon &mdash; and that the bayonet still preserves its ancient supremacy upon the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> After the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, last year, the newspaper press was unanimous for following up the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It represented the importance of striking at the heart of the enemy &mdash; of getting into the midst of his communications, and destroying the means he was preparing for our subjugation, before he could perfect them &mdash; of laying upon him the burden of the war, instead of assuming it ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The newspapers were treated with contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Newspaper tactics, newspaper strategy, and newspaper plans of campaign, became terms of reproach with which every suggestion from a newspaper was met. We were told that the science (not art) of war was something so sublimely mysterious, that common sense might strive in vain to penetrate its arcane.--Success was held to be no proof of generalship, and failure no proof that anything went wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The defensive was pitched upon, as the only mode of terminating the war with credit to ourselves and success to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Among other reasons assigned was <num value="1">one</num> that deserves especial notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It was said that if we went into <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> territory, it would make them so <sic>angy</sic> they would never forgive us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The defensive has now been fairly tried and we believe there are few who do not think that the newspaper generals were in the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>We doubt not that in their secret hearts the very men who fastened the defensive system on us, wished they had listened to the exhortations of the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>They certainly could not have brought greater disasters upon us than we have already experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> could hardly have been much angrier with us, under any circumstances, than they appear to be now. We could not more certainly have lost our forts and sea defences, than the defensive made us lose them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>And there was a possibility that we might have struck a number of great blows, and impressed the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with the disagreeable nature of war under all circumstances.--We could hardly have been worsted, in short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>So we advice all whom it may concern, hereafter, to pay more attention to the united voice of the press, let the object be what it may.--The united voice of the press is the united judgment of a whole people; and no matter upon what subject it may be concentrated, it is very apt to be right, even though that subject be the inscrutable mystery of Tactics. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> Once more the press is unanimous, or nearly so, in favor of an advance into the enemy's territories, if we still have the means to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Will the voice of the press be again despised?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We shall see. It is unanimous, too, against spading and ditching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>That system of tactics has been tried and found wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Cunctation has become obsolete and is no longer endurable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>If we invade the enemy, the press is unanimous in favor of making the invasion like a General of sense would make it. It is for attacking the enemy in detail <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> wherever an opportunity offers, and not waiting for him to unite all his forces, if it can be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>It is for rapid marches, frequent battles, and no ditching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>A General of the utmost energy and decision will be required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>It wishes him, when once appointed, to be let alone, to carry out his own plan of campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Let there be no interference from this point, and if a great victory be gained, let him not be removed to make way for some slow-coach, who will stop operations, stick his men in the mud, and wait until the enemy come to shell him out. If a sufficient force, headed by such a General, and let alone by officials, can be gotten together, and will promise to make a campaign on the above plan (which is the plan of the press) then the press will guaranty success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>If there be no fault in the <rs>General</rs> &mdash; if the plan of the press be thoroughly carried out in all particulars &mdash; and if the expedition fail &mdash; then the press, as in duty bound, will acknowledge that it is quite as ignorant of military matters as the wise acres who suggested the defensive policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Until that time, no man has a right to say <num value="1">one</num> word against newspaper <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and newspaper plans of campaign. </p> </div3>

<head>Southern patriotism.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> We do not believe there is on the pages of history the record of a people whose greatness of soul presented such an impenetrable coat of mail to the shafts and &#x0022;arrows of outrageous fortune&#x0022; as the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>They fully comprehend the sources of their weakness and their power, and they will hold to a rigid accountability those unreliable instruments of their will, who, like a broken reed, pierces the hand which leans upon it.--There has been in the history of this struggle a sublime development of the most glorious and beautiful qualities of the human character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>If, amid the ruins of the once grand and perfect temple of human nature, we should seek for some few touches of the original architect, which betrayed their divine origin &mdash; same fragments of pillars and of handiwork worthy of such an edifice &mdash; we think we should find it in the generous self-sacrifice and lofty heroism displayed by the <rs>Southern</rs> people in this remarkable struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>All this, however, we were prepared to expect from the unselfish and noble cast of the <rs>Southern</rs> character; but we were not prepared to expect the ravenous spirit of self-seeking and of greed which has been so balefully conspicuous from the beginning of the struggle, and which, more than any other cause, has brought upon us the misfortunes and calamities under which we are now laboring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> We are aware that so far as sordid money speculations are concerned, the greater part of them have been carried on by a class who are among us, but not of us, and yet the native quota of this plundering host is by no means as insignificant as we could desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>We refer particularly, however, to the insane eagerness for official emolument and distinction, and the callousness manifested by those who have successfully installed themselves in comfortable places to the sufferings and privations of those below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>In such a war as this, no <num value="1">one</num> ought to have asked or thought whether he should be General, <rs type="role" n="Colonel">Colonel</rs>, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, or <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs>, and the pay of officers, except strictly official expenses, should have been the same as the men. Instead of this, we have seen men grabbing at as many offices as they could hold, both civil and military, each <num value="1">one</num> of them furnishing a princely revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>We have seen Congress, whilst the enemy was thundering at the doors, spending days and weeks in debating the amount of its own pay. Such shameless selfishness as this has a disastrous effect upon the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The contrast between the popular generosity and the official self-seeking is fearful and inexplicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If our cause comes at last to ruin, it will not be difficult to trace <num value="1">one</num> of the chief agencies of its destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> But it will not come to ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Crushed to earth, it will rise again and become stronger by the lessons of experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>We are satisfied that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can never, under any circumstances, conquer back to the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> anything but a few Southern cities, and these will only remain their property as long as they can hold them in possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>But whilst the ultimate success of our cause is certain, it must throw off and purify itself of the spirit of selfishness and greed in public men, and kill off all fools and traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>In the meantime, we have happily many military leaders whose capacity and loyalty are beyond as question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>There are no better <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> than <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName>, and others who might be mentioned, and a whole host of subordinate officers capable of serving their country with the most conspicuous talent and gallantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Our army may well have confidence in such officers &mdash; men who, by their competency, efficiency, and fidelity, redeem the disgrace brought on us by others of a different character. </p> </div3>

<head>The confiscation bill.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> We are not surprised at the wholesale character of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> confiscation bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>When it comes to plundering people of their property, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle is at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>If there is any peculiar field where his genius towers above all competition, it is in confiscating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The wolf snuffing up the odors of a flock of sheep never felt so happy and ravenous as Doodle at this blessed moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Oh, the joys of confiscation Burning and bloodshed are good in their way, but the delights of murder and robbery are nothing to those of confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Every acre that we own, every horse and mule, every house and barn, every agricultural implement, and every article of <rs n="household furniture" type="product">household furniture</rs>, are to become <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle's.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> We had supposed that the days of the <name>Goths</name> and Vandals belonged to the past, but they have been &#x0022;resurrected&#x0022; again with a vengeance in this <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>This is no more figure of speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The confiscation bill proves that it is a literal verity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>This, and only this, is the interpretation of the whole war. The hungry population of the <rs>North</rs>, always pressing fiercely upon the means of subsistence, must have an outlet, where it can grass in green pastures and by still rivers &mdash; This they have found in the sunny <rs>South</rs>, and sooner or later they would have found a pretext for invasion, if no such thing as slavery had ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The war debt affords a convenient instrumentality for carrying out their purposes, and, if they can succeed, we are to be skinned as thoroughly as ever a butcher skinned carcase for the market. </p>
