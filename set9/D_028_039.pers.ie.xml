<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>General Orders, <num value="2">no. 2</num>.--In entering upon the campaign about to open, the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs> feels assured that the soldiers who have so long and so nobly borne the hardships and dangers of the war; require no exhortation to respond to the calls of honor and duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> With the liberty transmitted by their forefathers they have inherited the spirit to defend it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The choice between war and abject submission is before them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> To such a proposal brave men, with arms in their hands, can have but <num value="1">one</num> answer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> They cannot barter manhood for peace, nor the right of self government for life or property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> But justice to them requires a sterner admonition to those who have abandoned their comrades in the hour of peril. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> A last opportunity is offered them to wipe out the disgrace and escape the punishment of their crimes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> By authority of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, a pardon is announced to such deserters and men improperly absent as shall return to the commands to which they belong within the shortest possible time, not exceeding <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> from the publication of this order, at the headquarters of the department in which they may be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Those who may be prevented by interruption of communications, may report within the time specified to the nearest enrolling officer, or other officer on duty, to be forwarded as soon as practicable; and upon presenting a certificate from such officer, showing compliance with this requirement, will receive the pardon hereby offered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Those who have deserted to the service of the enemy, or who have deserted after having been once pardoned for the same offence, and those who shall desert, or absent themselves without authority, after the publication of this order, are excluded from its benefits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Nor does the offer of pardon extend to other offences than desertion and absence without permission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> By the same authority, it is also declared that no general amnesty will again be granted, and those who refuse to accept the pardon now offered, or who shall hereafter desert or absent themselves without leave, shall suffer such punishment as the courts may impose, and no application for clemency will be entertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Taking new resolution from the fate which our enemies intend for us, let every man devote all his energies to the common defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Our resources, wisely and vigorously employed, are ample, and with a brave army, sustained by a determined and united people, success, with <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> assistance, cannot be doubtful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The advantages of the enemy will have but little value if we do not permit them to impair our resolution.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> This practice, almost as injurious in its consequences as the crime of desertion, by the <rs>Articles</rs> of War exposes the offender to a similar punishment, and subjects the officer receiving him to dismissal from the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>To arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be hold by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to these officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Those who think to retain arms for their own defence should remember that if the army cannot protect them the arms will be of little use.--While no valid title can be acquired to public arms and equipments, except from the <rs>Government</rs>, it is reported that many persons have ignorantly purchased them from private parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>All these officers are requested, and those connected with this army are directed, to receive and receipt for all arms and equipments, whatever their condition, and forward the same, with a duplicate receipt, to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and report their proceedings to these headquarters.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> While it is hoped that no <num value="1">one</num> will disregard this appeal, all officers connected with this army are required, and all others are requested, to take possession of any public arms and equipments they may find in the hands of persons unwilling to surrender them to the service of the country, and to give receipt therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>A prompt compliance with the call will greatly promote the efficiency and strength of the army, particularly of the cavalry, and render it better able to protect the homes and property of the people from outrage. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Lee,General,R.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Lee,R.,E.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname>, <roleName n="General">General</roleName></persName></signed> </closer> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> We invoke all good citizens, wherever it is in their power, to place before deserters and absentees from the army the last appeal that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> will ever make to them, to return to their duty and resume their place under the flag.--It will be seen that a full and free pardon is now offered to all who will come back within the specified time, but that thenceforth no pardons will be granted either to those who refuse the present offer or to those who are hereafter guilty of desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We are sure that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> must deeply deplore the necessity of such a determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>No man has a kinder and more benevolent heart; no official, civil or military, has a more honest and profound sympathy with the private soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He feels their suffering as his own; and they are well aware of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Indeed, his tenderness to those under his command has been regarded by some as the only defect in his military character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>For our part, we honor him for it, but when such a man feels the necessity of proclaiming that, if the present offer of Executive clemency is not regarded, there will be no more pardons hereafter, we feel assured that he means all that he says, and that he will be as inflexible in the execution of his duty as he is humane and merciful in seeking to avoid the terrible necessity. </p> 
<p>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> You are too well acquainted with the reasons which have delayed my answer to your letter of the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th ultimo</day></dateStruct> to need any explanation on the subject, and must be too well assured of my warm personal regard and official confidence to render necessary any expression of the regret I feel at being deprived of your aid and counsel at this critical juncture in our affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> I had hoped that further reflection would induce a change in your views, but as this has not been the case, I am not at liberty to question the reasons for your decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It is a matter exclusively for your private judgment whether you should be controlled by an expression of opinion on the part of the <rs>Virginia</rs> delegation in Congress that it would be advisable &#x0022;to re-organize my Cabinet by relieving all the present heads of departments.&#x0022; I have no choice but to acquiesce in your conclusion, that you cannot longer fill your present position without impaired usefulness, nor without doing violence to your feelings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> I cannot, however, recognize the propriety of your decision, because I cannot admit the existence of a power or right in the legislative department of the <rs>Government</rs>, or in any part or branch of it, to control the continuance in office of those &#x0022;principal officers in each of the executive departments,&#x0022; whose choice the <rs>Constitution</rs> has vested in the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>; whose advice in writing he is empowered &#x0022;to require,&#x0022; and whose tenure of office is exceptional, being made to depend expressly on &#x0022;the pleasure of the <rs>President</rs>.&#x0022; The relations between the <rs>President</rs> and the heads of the executive departments are from their nature of the closest and most intimate character; they imply mutual confidence and esteem, and a general concurrence of opinion on administrative policy; and it is not a constitutional function of the legislative department to interfere with these relations, nor can it be assumed that a change of the heads of departments would alter the administrative policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, without also assuming as true the injurious supposition that the <rs>President</rs> has permitted them to pursue a policy at variance with his own, and has thus failed to do his own duty as chief of the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">executive department</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> The notion that, under our form of government, an expression by the legislative of want of confidence in the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">executive department</orgName> is an appropriate exercise of constitutional power, and should cause a change in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, is quite unfounded; and it is not difficult to see that it arises from a false analogy, that most fertile source of error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, a vote of the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> expressing a want of confidence in the ministry has a controlling influence, because the <name>Parliament</name> governs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>With us it is the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> are so distinct as to be opposite, rather than parallel, to each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the ministry are the executive government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The sovereign rules, but does not govern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>In the <rs>Confederacy</rs> the heads of departments neither rule nor govern. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the sovereign is irresponsible, and &#x0022;can do no wrong,&#x0022; and the ministry alone are responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the <rs>President</rs> may do wrong, and is responsible for so doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The remedy for his wrong-doing is impeachment by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> The Senate is without power even to impeach, and can only act as judges when the <rs type="place">House</rs> impeaches. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the crown being hereditary as well as irresponsible, the control <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> of the people over the policy of the <rs>Government</rs> consists in refusing, by their Commons, the grant to the sovereign of supplies necessary for carrying on the government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> In the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the people choose the <rs>President</rs> as well as the <rs>Congress</rs>, and by giving him a term of <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, and making the tenure of <orgName>office of the Cabinet</orgName> &#x0022;his pleasure,&#x0022; have debarred themselves from the power of enforcing any change of administrative policy during that term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It is known that this lengthened term of <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, without re-eligibility, was conferred by our Constitution on the <rs>Executive</rs> for the express purpose of imparting stability to government and of withdrawing all motive for courting popular favor at the expense of duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the ministry are <hi rend="italics">members of the legislative department, originate laws, guide administration, exercise the appointing power to all offices</hi> (the sovereign's power being to practice purely nominal), <hi rend="italics">are apprised in advance of the grounds of a proposed vote of want of confidence, and have the power and means of defending themselves.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> In the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the exact reverse of all this is the case, and the heads of departments are not even admitted to the right of debate on the subjects appertaining to their departments, as contemplated by the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, even after a vote of censure, the ministry may dissolve Parliament, and appeal to the country, which has not unfrequently reversed the vote. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> The Commons are thus restrained from factious or unfounded charges by the responsibility of making them at the peril of being discountenanced by the people, and thus losing their own seats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> In the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the exact reverse of all this is again the case, and a vote of want of confidence would be free from all salutary restraint or responsibility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> It is needless to continue this exposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It is too clear for doubt that the legislative and executive departments, deriving equally their existence from the votes of the people, it would be quite as proper for the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">executive department</orgName> to express want of confidence in the legislative department as for the latter to express distrust of the former. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> In stating these views, nothing is further from my intention than to deny to enlightened public opinion, when deliberately formed after knowledge of facts, its just and legitimate influence.--Such public opinion is almost invariably correct, and can rarely be disregarded without injury to the public weal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> My purpose is simply to deny that the declaration of a State delegation, or even a vote of <num value="1">one</num> or both Houses, is entitled to be considered as the authentic expression of such opinion, or as requiring concession from a co-ordinate department of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> I have been led into this digression by the peculiar circumstances which have given rise to your resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>They are without precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>I cannot, however, refuse to relieve you from duties which the action of your State delegation has rendered distasteful to you. That you have devoted yourself with entire singleness of purpose to the public welfare; that your labors have been incessant, your services important, and your counsels very valuable to myself and to your colleagues, would be as readily attested by them as by myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The regret that our official relations now end is relieved by the reflection that you will be near me, and by the assurance that I can ever call on you with confidence for any aid that you can render in private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Our personal relations, so pleasant during our official intercourse, will not, I trust, be interrupted; and you carry with you in your retirement my warmest wishes for your health and prosperity. </p> <closer> <salute>With cordial esteem, your friend,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName>  <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Seddon,the Honorable,J.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="expanded:Seddon,James,A.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.</signed> </closer> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">1st instant</day></dateStruct>, accepting my resignation of the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>I appreciate gratefully the confidence and approval you so kindly avow in reference to myself and my official course, and cannot too strongly express the gratification they afford me. Nor is that gratification alloyed by any contrariety of opinion on my part in the general views you have felt it appropriate to express in reference to the relations and obligations subsisting, under our constitutional system, between the <rs>Executive</rs> and his ministers on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and the <name>Legislature</name>, or any part of it, on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Your exposition of those relations, and the duties resulting, is too lucid and just not to command the full concurrence of my judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>I should regret if my action gave countenance to any opposing opinions, and I owe it to myself, no less than to you, and to the maintenance of sound constitutional principles, to disavow such construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>I have never recognized, nor do I, in retiring, admit of any claim of right on the part of the <name>Legislature</name>, or any portion or delegation in it, to dictate to the <rs>Executive</rs> the selection or change of any of his officers, and, least of all, those holding the responsible and confidential relations of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> ministers, nor the power to impose an obligation on such ministers, or any of them, to retire at their wish, or on their expression of a want of confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>On the contrary, circumstances might exist which would exact from the <rs>Executive</rs> and his ministers, as a high duty, resistance to <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> such action of the <name>Legislature</name>, or its members. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> Special considerations, involving both sentiments and convictions of duty, yet in entire consistency with the constitutional views so ably presented by you, governed my course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>While reluctant, as I still am, to believe that the advice of the delegation in Congress from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> embodied the &#x0022;enlightened public opinion&#x0022; of the <rs>State</rs>, yet it necessarily had an imposing appearance of expressing the present feeling of the <rs>State</rs>, at least in relation to the member of your Cabinet who was her citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>A <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, I have ever cherished peculiar pride in my State, and have felt the obligations to honor and heed her lightest voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>I deemed myself, therefore, bound to defer to what had the plausible semblance of her will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Besides, as I have in my letter of resignation intimated, the expression of opinion from so influential a body as the delegation of my State, even though mistaken, could not fail to impair the confidence and capacity for usefulness which, in the present exigencies, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> should possess in the fullest possible measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>In this point of view my retirement was due to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and its cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>To yourself I conceived it no less due. It was professed, and I had no reason to doubt, that the action of the <rs>Virginia</rs> delegation was taken in no factious or hostile spirit towards you, but, on the contrary, was induced by friendly, not less than patriotic feelings, and the desire to impart additional strength and confidence to your administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Whatever little influence might be attached to the opinions of the delegation as to the members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> from other States, it might naturally be expected not to be without weight as a manifestation of public opinion in reference to the member from their own State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It was therefore incumbent on me to disembarrass you from all feelings of delicacy or personal regard towards myself which might hinder the freest exercise of your judgment in the selection of another <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> who could command more fully the confidence of the country and bring to its service greater influence and power of usefulness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> I owed it to my colleagues of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> that if, as might be supposed, they had been involved in an adverse opinion by the delegation from my own State from reluctance to move against the member from her alone, such cause should be promptly removed, and that, in any event, whatever propriety existed for their separate action as a delegation, in the fact that there was a member in the <rs>Cabinet</rs> from their State, should no longer be allowed to continue, to the prejudice of the entire Cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It is, perhaps, but justice to myself, in this connection, to say that assurances were given to me that the action of the delegation had not been directed against me, specially or separately, but still I could not be insensible that, being confined to <num value="1">one</num> delegation, it might be construed otherwise, and in that view be felt to operate, because of my relation to them, injuriously on others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>My resignation at once swept away all such implications, and left their opinions against others without such accessory justification or influence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> From these blended motives of sentiment and duty my course was unhesitatingly taken, and though the privilege of serving the country in times like these is to be valued, and the honoring associations I have enjoyed are not parted with without pain, my subsequent reflections have only confirmed me in the correctness of my decision. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> I have only to add renewed assurances of the honor and pleasure I feel in returning your personal as well as official esteem, and to say I shall be happy, by all the means in my power, by such modes as you suggest or otherwise, to further the accomplishment of your exalted duties, or to have the opportunity at any time of contributing to your personal prosperity and happiness. </p> <closer> <salute>Very truly, yours,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Seddon,,James,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="default:Seddon,James,A.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName>  <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Her descriptions will be sure to interest many of our lady readers.--She writes: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> &#x0022;In ladies' evening toilets it is impossible not to perceive a decided tendency toward a radical change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>This change, or reform, is as yet confined to the very <hi rend="italics">elite</hi> of fashionable society, but by a well-known and invariable law will doubtless extend in another season or <num value="2">two</num> to all classes that pretend to &#x0027;dress, &#x0027; and not merely to be clothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>At Compiegne this winter <num value="1">one</num> might have fancied <num value="1">one</num>'s self at the court of the <rs>Empress Josephine</rs>, so close was the imitation to the fashion of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Crinolines were discarded, the skirts being narrow, almost tight; the waists very short, cut in the shape of a heart in front, and supported by broad waistbands with fancy clasps; the materials worn were dotted with gold stars or bees; the hair, much raised behind, was artistically disposed in a mass of tiny ringlets upon the forehead, and encircled by a diadem of massive gold or of precious stones.--Rich necklaces, extremely long ear-rings, and gloves, coming far over the wrist, completed the illusion of a return to the taste of Malmaison.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Index"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> She adds, somewhat wickedly: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> &#x0022;Few styles of toilet are more trying to female loveliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>If a woman is truly beautiful it singularly enhances the effect of her natural graces, of the elegance and ease of her every movement. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> On the other hand, what a risk of revelations which the cunning art of the dressmaker has no longer the same discretion to prevent!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>For this reason it is to be expected that the new fashion will be slow in gaining universal favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> &#x0022;Another contemplated change is to revive white muslin for evening parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Female society would thus divide itself into <num value="2">two</num> classes: the <hi rend="italics">riches elegantes,</hi> who will wear satin of embroidered <hi rend="italics">gros de Naples,</hi> or velvet braided with fur, toilets which, for a dinner party, are considered of the last elegance; and the <hi rend="italics">simplettes,</hi> who will please in modest white muslin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Economy is given as the reason for this return to an almost discarded fashion; but we all know how severely exacting is this most &#x0027;simple&#x0027; of toilets. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The skirt is worn tucked up over short fancy petticoats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The short, tight-fitting <hi rend="italics">basque,</hi> held by a wide waistband, is of the same material as the skirt, generally a pretty English-made grey, or some darker shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The petticoat is cash-mere, of a lively color, either <rs type="color">blue</rs>, <rs type="color">red</rs> or lilac, enlivened by a small flounce, and ornamented with some trimmings or braiding, according to taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>An <name>English</name> hat, Polish bottines, stockings of the same color as the petticoat, and straw-colored dog-skin gloves, complete a walking costume as picturesque as it is convenient.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="adds"></bibl></cit> </div3>
