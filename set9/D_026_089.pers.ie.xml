<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>In fact there is no feature of the <rs>Southern</rs> spring more uniform then the blue coat vegetation, and at a certain period <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and other stalwart husbandmen, have to go out and cut down, and thresh and gather in to the <name>Libby</name> and other storehouses just as regularly and inevitably as our farmers gather in the fruits of the earth. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> It is hardly respectful, however, to the fruits of the earth to indulge such comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Nor do we mean to say that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in any respect resemble the productions of our soil except that they always appear in the spring and disappear in the harvest time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>They may be classed more properly with those destructive insects which inflict such injury on agriculture, and often ruin the grain crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>They are caterpillars, grubs, <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">hessian</rs> flies, maggots, and wheat midges combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>In <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> they may be likened to joint worms, being in the larva state during the winter, assuming the pup condition in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and boring their way into complete daylight and activity with the warm weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>In the cotton States they play the part of blister flies, leaf beetles, boll worms, and cotton lice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>This last insect more accurately describes the nature and habitue of the enemy than any other known to entomology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>In color it is in some instances black, but oftener resembles a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> greenback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The end of its whole existence is to rob the <rs>Southern</rs> planter of his great staple, which is also the entire end and aim of Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>But it has various obstacles which interfere with its predatory purposes, and among them is a kind of miscegenation process, which is sure to bring it to grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Another insect, called the ichneumon, lays an egg in the body of the louse, which, hatching into a grub, devours the inside of the still living insect, until it eventually dies, clinging to the leaf even in death, and the ichneumon makes its appearance from the old skin of the louse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>It is but just to the cotton louse to admit that, unlike the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, this kind of amalgamation is not voluntary on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Let us be thankful that the human pests of our agriculture have their enemies as well as the insects, and that they have welcomed to their embrace, in the beastliness of miscegenation, an ichneumon, which will eat them up alive, and hatch a progeny that will continue to devour and destroy their race. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
