<head>Anti-slavery in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> Because the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> has ventured to suggest that slavery is not condemned by the <name>Scriptures</name> the vials of abolitionism in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> have been uncorked upon its devoted head, and the <rs>Ezeter Hall</rs> organs predict that the announcement of such a godless proposition by the leading journal of the <name>Kingdom</name> will produce a universal reaction in that country against the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>We have no apprehension that any such result will follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Even if the positions of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> were unscriptural, the <rs>Southern</rs> cause could not be held responsible, by intelligent <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, for the arguments of the <hi rend="italics">Times.</hi> But at any dispassionate tribunal we should be perfectly willing to rest the whole Southern cause upon the propositions announced by the <hi rend="italics">Times </hi> It is indeed, the mildest form of stating the <name>Scriptural</name> argument; for, not only does the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> not condemn, but it explicitly unactions slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The proofs of this have been presented to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> public in such a multitude of books, pamphlets, and speeches, that the merest child in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> could easily confound the ablest polemic of <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName> upon the <name>Scriptural</name> view of the slavery question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> That the public sentiment of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should be shocked by the assertion that slavery is not condemned by Scripture, is a signal illustration of the power of fanaticism in blinding the mind to the clearest teachings of religious truth, and in substituting its own <hi rend="italics">ignis fatuus</hi> light for the noonday insure of Divine Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It is the constant <unclear>bo</unclear> of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> that the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> alone, is the religion of their country; but whenever the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> comes in collision with the peculiar prejudices and dormer it is as completely ignored as the <unclear></unclear> mythologies or the language of the <name>Koran</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>What renders still more astonishing the sensation that the proposition of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> creates, is the fact that, not a century ago, every divine in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and every commentator upon Holy <persName n="Witt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Witt,nomatch:0"><surname>Witt</surname></persName> taught precisely the same doctrine announced by the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> and actually illustrating it by the same example, among others of the fugitive slave returned by St. Faul to his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>For <measure n="1800years" type="date">eighteen hundred years</measure> the universal <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> taught the doctrine, and not only this, but as a Church, as well as individually, owned slaves; and yet, at this late day the discovery is made by <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName> that slavery is a sin, and that to say it is not is a &#x0022;godless&#x0022; declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>If that be so, then it has taken the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> <measure n="1800years" type="date">eighteen hundred years</measure> to find out what the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> forbids, and the discovery has at last been made only by those whose interest it was to assume such a position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> In this connection, we observe that <persName n="Rosecrans,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, (brother of <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>,) has lately delivered a lecture in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> upon some old religious order for the ransom of slaves, which he is said to designate as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> anti-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">slavery society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>We take it for granted he refers to a <rs n="Roman Catholic" type="religion">Roman Catholic</rs> association which once existed for the ransom of <name>Christian</name> slaves from the <name>Turks</name>, and which <hi rend="italics">ransomed</hi> them not only by paying for them, but sometimes by the members of the society actually taking the places of the captives in order to effect their liberation &mdash; Is that the kind of emancipation contemplated by the <name>Gorilla</name> and his <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>We should be pleased to learn if <persName n="Rosecrans,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> instructed his <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> hearers to go and do likewise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Did he invoke his hearers to offer the full market value of the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves, and if that would not effect the object, to offer to become slaves themselves in place of the negroes? </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
