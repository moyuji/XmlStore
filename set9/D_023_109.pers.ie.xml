<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> In consequence of the non-arrival of the <rs>Central</rs> train up to a late hour last night, we are without even the usual reports derived from passengers by that train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is a fact no longer necessary to be disguised, that our army has changed its position, and that it has taken up a new line of defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> A rumor prevailed late last evening that the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>'s office</orgName> was in receipt of intelligence that a battle had been commenced between the armies of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Whether the report is reliable we are unable to state, but think it not altogether improbable, from movements which were previously reported to be in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <num value="4">four</num> companies engaged were under command of <persName n="Burgwyn,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burgwyn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Burgwyn</surname></persName>, and hold in check a largely superior force of the enemy during the day, and until the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 17">17th</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 57">57th regiments</orgName> came up, when battle was offered, but declined by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Our loss is reported at <measure n="2" type="killed">two killed</measure> and <measure n="31" type="wounded">thirty-one wounded</measure>, most of them only slightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The enemy's loss is known to have been much greater, <num value="1">one</num> entire <orgName n="Cavalry company" type="company">cavalry company</orgName> being out up and destroyed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> We have published some of the letters to the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> of <persName n="Hurlbut,,William,Henry,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Hurlbut,William,Henry,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Hurlbut</surname></persName>, who escaped from this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>His last letter recounts the mode of his departure, which was aided and participated in by a native of <placeName reg="Troy, Rensselaer, New York" key="tgn,7014660">Troy, N. Y.</placeName>, who had been detailed from the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> for special service in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and so <q>&#x0022;won upon the regard of his officers&#x0022;</q> that he got an honorable discharge from the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Having made up his mind to leave, <persName n="Hurlbut,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Hurlbut,William,Henry,,"><surname>Hurlbut</surname></persName> sent for his friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> His position made it easy for him to obtain all the information which we needed, and representing that it was his intention to visit <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> for the purpose of buying goods, he succeeded, after the exercise of a little tact and the administration of strong liquors in proper quantities, in extracting from <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Maryland</rs> managers of the <q>&#x0022;under ground line&#x0022;</q> a systematic account of the points to be made in passing from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to the <rs>Potomac</rs>, with the names of certain persons at each of those points from whom the necessary facilities could be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This information my new ally brought to me on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="08-13">August 13.</date> The next question was to secure a passport out of the city, the <orgName n="Picket Guards" type="guards">picket guards</orgName> having been recently removed nearer the city lines and enjoined to keener vigilance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> It was, of course, out of the question for me to obtain a passport in my own person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It might, indeed, and probably would have been granted to me, as I had just received a general passport to travel Southwards in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, but in receiving it I should have been required to subscribe an obligation of <q>&#x0022;suit and service&#x0022;</q> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, which I wished to avoid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>My companion, who considered himself to have been treated by the <rs>Confederates</rs> as pirates treat the captive sailors to whom they offer the option of a berth in the forecastle or a dance from the yard-arm, was less punctilious upon this head, and going directly to the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>'s office</orgName>, obtained, without much difficulty, a pass permitting him to travel in <placeName reg="Hanover county, Virginia" key="tgn,1002451">Hanover county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A stroke of the pen extended this permission to his <q> &#x0022;brother,&#x0022;</q> and all was now ready, save the means of transportation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> I then sent my servant to find for me a buggy and horse suitable for country riding, as I intended to visit the battle fields, and might be absent perhaps <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>. At <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> on <date value="08-15">Friday morning, August 15th,</date> this establishment &mdash; perhaps the rustiest, most ramshackle and mud-destained vehicle in which <num value="2">two</num> New Yorkers ever condescended to ride &mdash; drew up before my door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>From my windows we perceived that its advent had excited some degree of attention among a knot of Baltimorean detectives, who lived in a house nearly opposite, and were in the habit of making the summer night hideous with perpetual repetitions of <q>&#x0022;My Maryland,&#x0022;</q> sung in a lamentable manner to the pathetic accompaniment of a diseased accordion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We hastened, therefore, our departure, sallied boldly out, and examining the reins and harness with as much gravity and attention as if we had been on the point of testing the condition of <placeName reg="Flora Temple">Flora Temple</placeName> or <persName n="Suffolk,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Suffolk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Suffolk</surname></persName>, trotted quietly away up <address><street n="Marshall street">Marshall street</street></address>, in what we believed to be the direction of the <rs type="place">Brook turnpike</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The day was favorable &mdash; that is, it was an ill favored day, such as is not uncommon toward the middle and end of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>--a day of clouded skies, and chilly showers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> About <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> beyond the city limits, having previously passed the line of fortified redoubts guarded by a few loungers with lances, we came upon the <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket-guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket-guard</orgName> was a tall, good-natured fellow, in a butternut suit, who sauntered slowly down towards us from his seat beneath a tree on a slope near the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>His only weapon was a large sword, which could hardly have interfered with the prosecution of our journey, had he been dissatisfied with our passport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But this was not the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He returned it to us with the remark, that as the <q> &#x0022;enemy wasn't in <placeName reg="Hanover county, Virginia" key="tgn,1002451">Hanover county</placeName>, we might go ahead; for you know,&#x0022;</q> he added, in a confidential manner, <q>&#x0022;when a country's invaded, we can't let people go riding about in it&#x0022;</q> Casually missing our way in a small wood which we found occupied by a cavalry camp, we came upon a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and superfluous picket on striking <address><street n="Brook turnpike">Brook turnpike</street></address>. But it was now raining very hard, and the <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket-guard</orgName>, a <q>&#x0022;city soldier&#x0022;</q> in a neat uniform, had no disposition to inspect us over closely, at the expense of an inevitable ducking. --So, <q>&#x0022;past we glide&#x0022;</q> once more, and find ourselves upon the direct high-road to <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover Junction</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>As we neared that point, distant some <placeName><distance reg="20miles">20 miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, we came upon a moving column of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> advancing to join the <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName>, and plowing its way painfully, with heavily loaded wagons and jaded horses, over roads that were half canals with mud and swamp water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The National army had occupied this country in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>, and the traces of its presence were everywhere visible in bits of carefully-laid plank and corduroy, of which the <rs>Confederates</rs> now gladly availed themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Of devastation, save in the blazing of trees and an occasional lapse in the line of worm fences, we saw no signs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>A young <persName n="Lieutenant,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lieutenant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Mississippian</roleName> <surname>Lieutenant</surname></persName>, extremely well mounted, joined us about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> from the <rs type="place">Junction</rs>, and taking us for residents of the county, asked our pilotage to his point of destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>As we had made up our minds to follow the telegraph lines we readily offered to show him the way, and carried him safely in. The <rs type="place">Junction</rs> was swarming with troops and country people, and it is not improbable that the company of our <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs> may have saved us from some disagreeable inquiries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> At <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover Junction</placeName> we were to find a farmer who would ferry us over the <placeName key="tgn,1127875" n="1.000 416" reg="north anna, virginia, united states">North Anna river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A small boy puts us upon the road to this farmer's house, and the farmer himself not only put us across the river in a deep batteau, but upon our requesting him to take charge of our horse and buggy <q>&#x0022;until we should return from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> volunteered an introduction of another farmer, who would see us safely over the ford of the <rs>Mattaponi</rs> and set us on our way to the river <rs>Rappahannock</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> This <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> farmer, in consideration of a sum to him in hand paid, furnished us with a comfortable night's lodging, an excellent supper and breakfast, a good horse and wagon, and an intelligent negro guide.

<head>The press and the <rs>Government</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals declare that <q>&#x0022;a military despotion which suffers, or is not able to check, such outspoken freedom on the part of public writers is in a fair way to succumb.&#x0022; </q> The allusion is to the frank and untrammeled manner in which the <rs>Southern</rs> press comments on public affairs.--The statement is its own refutation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/><q>&#x0022;A military despotism&#x0022;</q> and a press of <q>&#x0022;outspoken freedom&#x0022;</q> can no more exist together than fire and water &mdash; It is a proof of the strength instead of the weakness of the <rs>Southern Government</rs> that it permits the press to discuss public affairs with the most <q> &#x0022;outspoken freedom.&#x0022;</q> If it were a military despotism, and <num value="1">one</num> which doubted its own solidity and permanence, it would do precisely what <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is doing in the <rs>North</rs>, --silence every press that dared to say its soul was its own, and send its editors to a dungeon or bastille. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> Nothing can be more preposterous than the assertion of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> that the <rs>Southern</rs> came is declining in popular favor because some Southern newspapers criticise the acts of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> cannot understand that the cause and the <rs>Government</rs> are <num value="2">two</num> distinct things, and that were the <rs>Government</rs> ever so unpopular &mdash; which it is not &mdash; or were there no Government at all, the cause would be as dear as ever to Southern hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The Southern Government, in the judgment of the whole civilized world, and even according to the admissions of its enemies, has accomplished wonders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It will bear comparison at any rate with the <rs>Northern Government</rs>, which, with <num value="5">five</num> times its resources of men and means, it has driven back and defeated for more than a bear and <num value="0.5">a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It is impossible to claim for it infallibility; there have been errors and abuses doubtless, which the press has denounced boldly, proving, at all events, that the <rs>Government</rs> does not interfere with the press, and therefore, that it is not a military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But whatever the merits of the <rs>Government</rs>, the people are fighting not for them, but for themselves, and unless they can prove traitors to their own lives, fortunes, and honor, would never desert their cause even if their Government were weaker and more contemptible than its worst enemies pretend. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> It is natural however, that men who are slaves themselves, and slaves to the meanest and most ignoble of tyrants, should look upon freedom in any form as dangerous to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>There is scarcely a press in the <rs>North</rs> which dares to dispute the infallibility of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, although in their secret hearts they believe him to be thoroughly imbecile and corrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Is this a proof of the strength of their Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Is it a proof of anything but the strength of a military despotism, which is strong because those who submit to it are only fit to be slaves? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>That fine piece of strategy will not soon be forgotten by mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>A General who does not care to encumber himself with baggage, but cheerfully sacrifices wife and children for his own good, can be safely trusted in any position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The Southern sharpshooters would never be able to find him, and whoever might be hurt, it would not be <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>He is too generous to rival the military renown of his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and too humane to expose the <rs>North</rs> to the inconsiderable anguish of a possible bereavement of their idolized Chief.--We wish he could overcome these scruples, and give free scope to the martial instincts of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>If he could be persuaded to show himself for only <measure n="30seconds" type="date">thirty seconds</measure> in front of a single Confederate marksman, he would make a name in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>We learn from reliable authority that there is no foundation for this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Our informant states that he has under his command about a <num value="120">hundred and twenty</num> men, a number sufficient for his purposes, and all that he wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>With this force he is striking terror to the enemy in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and doing an amount of mischief which some commanders of large armies have not been able to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>If any of his men fall into the enemy's hands, which is rarely the case, they are treated with the most <q>&#x0022;distinguished consideration.&#x0022;</q> The reason is that, at an early period of his career, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> hung <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of his guerrillas whom they had taken prisoners, whereupon <persName n="Quantrell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Quantrell,nomatch:0"><surname>Quantrell</surname></persName>, who is a gentleman of sense as well as true humanity, hung <num value="5">five</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for <num value="1">one</num> guerrilla, a proceeding which had the instant effect of civilizing the <rs>Federal</rs> and teaching them to observe the ordinary rules of war. <persName n="Tracy,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Tracy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Tracy</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most gallant and efficient of the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, has adopted the retaliatory system in the same proportion of <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, and with equally happy effects. </p> </div3>
