<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Moreover, the reduction of the war taxon <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, as the result of the happy termination of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> affair, was announced in the <rs type="place">Chambers</rs> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and finality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>It was generally understood that the <name>Prussians</name> were about ready to give the assault on the <rs>Danish</rs> works at <placeName key="tgn,1027775" n="1.000 10" reg="Dybbol,Sonderjylland,Danmark,Europe">Duppel</placeName>, and that there was little doubt of their success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Already, too, the probability of an agreement in the <rs>London Conference</rs> on the subject of an armistice was generally admitted; but, in definitive, no <num value="1">one</num> was prepared for such an avalanche of peace certainties as feil upon us yesterday. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> What is to be the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>On every side we hear loud exultations at the prospect of <rs n="General Peace" type="misc">general peace</rs>, and people are prediction a speedy reduction of the armies and navies of the great States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>And whether these happy results are to be attained or not, it is certain that an immense impetus has been given to commerce and to commercial enterprises in general, and that we are entering upon a season of unexampled prosperity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> The rejoicing over the happy termination of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> affair are destined to receive a slight cooling off from the resolution voted by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and which arrived at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> last evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>This resolution has not been published yet in the <rs>French</rs> papers, and we do not yet know, therefore, how it is to be appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>But the <rs>Government</rs> seems to attach very great importance to it, for not only was the telegraphic announcement of it suppressed last evening, but the telegraphic dispatch entire, brought by the <rs>Scotia</rs>, was delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> made the resolution say that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people would not &#x0022;tolerate&#x0022; the new Government in <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName>, and it was probably this version of it which induced the <rs>Government</rs> to suppress that part of the <rs>Scotia</rs>'s dispatch until farther evidence of authenticity should arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>In my next letter I shall be able to give you an idea of the impression this important resolution of the <orgName n="American Congress" type="congress">American Congress</orgName> has produced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> But to aggravate matters, as between <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the treaty which has just been concluded between the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName> places things in a different situation from what they were at the time <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> wrote the dispatch in which he gave <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> hopes that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would recognize the new order of things in <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName>; for at that time there is reason to believe that the <rs>French Government</rs> promised the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that they were going to retire from <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName> almost immediately after the installation of the <rs>Archduke Maximilian</rs> &mdash; a promise which naturally led the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> to say that, as defenders of the doctrine of popular sovereignty, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would be obliged to accept whatever Government the people of <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName> accepted and freely maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But now the <rs>French Government</rs> has violated this promise; for, as will be seen by the treaty between the <num value="2">two</num> empires, the <rs>French</rs> flag is going to stand guard over the new throne for a period of <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, which is too long a period to respond to the words an &#x0022;almost immediate evacuation,&#x0022; and which does not allow a free expression of the sentiments of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> Another circumstance connected with this treaty aggravates the case still more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It would have been easy for the <rs>French Government</rs> to have loaned its officers and men to <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName>, and to have placed them under the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> flag, for they would have served the new Empire just as well as if under the <rs>French</rs> flag and under <name>French</name> direction, and then it could not be said that it was a French <orgName n="Army of Occupation" type="army">army of occupation</orgName>, it could not be said that it was in any sense a French Government, and above all <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> would not have been bound to resent the insults offered to these <num value="8000">8,000</num> men, nor bound to fight for the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> throne. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> But it seems that in the counsels of the <rs>Emperor</rs> there were <num value="2">two</num> parties, a war and a peace party, so to speak, the war party insisting that the way to prevent the interference of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> affairs was to leave the <rs>French</rs> flag there as a scarecrow as long as possible; while the peace party, better acquainted with the real situation of things in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, advocated the plan of a total withdrawal of the <rs>French</rs> flag as soon as the new throne could be rendered safe against <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName> itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> The war party, as you will see by the treaty, succeeded, and the <rs>French</rs> flag waving over a small army of <num value="8000">8,000</num> men, is to remain in the country us an intimidation to the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>; for, to prove that this is the object of that provision of the treaty, I have only to say that there is not a man in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> who does not believe that <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName> could easily compose an army of his own of foreign and native elements quite sufficient to protect him against the <rs>National</rs> party in <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName>, and that if he had not believed the country was pacified, or rather converted to that extent, he would never have undertaken the voyage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> This leaving of the <rs>French</rs> flag in the country is therefore a penance to us; it is a warning by which <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> says to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>: <q>&#x0022;We are still in <placeName reg="Mexico, Oswego, New York" key="tgn,2070527">Mexico</placeName>, and if you attack the new order of things before the expiration of <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> you will have a war on your hands with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> The resolution of the <orgName n="American Congress" type="congress">American Congress</orgName>, therefore, could not have fallen in a more propitious moment; for although it is destined to render more delicate the relations between the <num value="2">two</num> countries, it will at the same time enlighten the situation and allow each party to see where the other stands, and this is always an advantage. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> The ruthless invader again essays his periodical effort to capture this city &mdash; this &#x0022;hateful city,&#x0022; as he styles it. Our people have become so accustomed to these marches upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and the lesser raids of the enemy, that they are no longer excited by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The spirit-stirring drum and all the emblems of war create no excitement now in our streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The citizen leaves his home, his office, or his shop, in a quiet and orderly manner, as if he were going on a matter of private and not at all exciting business; and the women of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> look upon the departing columns of citizen soldiers &mdash; their fathers, husbands, brothers, friends &mdash; not only resignedly, but cheerfully &mdash; proud indeed of the gallantry of those upon whom they lean, in repairing to the point of danger to defend their city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>A people schooled into a sense of danger and exigency, as are the people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, are naturally ready to meet it. But this people are animated by something more than the mere familiarity with the menaces of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>They have a higher education to duty and resolution. --This they have shown throughout this war in their readiness to meet sacrifices of all kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They have united with their devotion to the cause and their resolution to make any sacrifice for the public defence an active humanity and hospitality that display virtues that will entitle them to some of the brightest pages in the history of their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> We do not believe the enemy will ever reach the city defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>If he should, however, they will be defended in a manner that will deprive the foe of all hope of ever reaching this place, which he regards as the vital point in the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion, and which he hates with the deadly hatred of the bloodhound and the wolf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We well know its fate, if it ever falls into his hands, and that alone is enough &mdash; independent of the high motives which nerve the arms of our soldiers &mdash; to make its defence invincible and impregnable. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> From the beginning of this war every trick and artifice that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ingenuity could invent, has been employed to deceive the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, and induce them to enlist in the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="Army of Invasion" type="army">army of invasion</orgName> to overrun and desolate the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Agents have been busy in all parts of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, stimulating emigration to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by promises of all kinds that were calculated to entice them from their home &mdash; a home, indeed, where they are not under a government or laws of their own choice or consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It is strange that a people complaining of this injustice, should be prevailed upon to come here to aid in imposing upon us of the <rs>South</rs> a government we abhor, and a political association with a people we detest!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Yet <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Ingenuity and cunning contrived to cover up this inconsistency by sophistry and demagogues; and the promises were too tempting to be resisted by the impulsive sons of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> The <rs type="role" reg="chief-Agent">chief agent</rs> of accomplishing their delusion, is the promises which the hypocritical and false hearted <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been making ever since the war began, that they would, immediately after crushing the rebellion in the <rs>South</rs>, join the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> in a war upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for the independence of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Societies have been organized at the <rs>North</rs> upon this &#x0022;platform&#x0022;--the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> always have their &#x0022;platforms,&#x0022; which mean liberal promises they have no idea of fulfilling; dishonest professions, where with to deceive honest people and impose upon mankind!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>These societies have been industriously engaged in the work of deluding the poor <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>; and how they have succeeded the ranks of their armies give sad proofs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> are found in every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> regiment, and their blood has flowed freely on every battle field of this war. Following the delusive hopes of help for themselves after the conquest of the <rs>South</rs>; confiding in the deceitful sympathies of the faithless <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, they have borne the brunt of battles, held the positions of danger, and fallen where the slaughter was greatest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>All, all to find themselves disappointed, deceived and betrayed! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are not less successful with the <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, but they are inveigled with a different kind of bait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>In the majority of the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> emigrants we have strangely mixed up with a great deal of practical souse, good appetite, powerful digestion, and talent for thrift &mdash; transcendental Red Republicanism, which is everything monstrous and anarchical in society and polities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> reach them by bounties; also, down the throat, and by way of their fanaticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>They stimulate their acquisitiveness by large bounties, and promises of thrift from the plunder and pillage of Southern mansions, and inflame their fanaticism by painting the horrors of slavery, and representing the <rs>South</rs> as a nation of aristocrats, endeavoring to destroy the liberties of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The Federal armies show how by these arts the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have filled up their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Well may the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> say that they have replenished their thinned ranks with <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, and negroes, and that they could have filled them in no other way! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/> With reference to the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, some recent proceedings in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> shewed how the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were persevering in their atrocious fraud upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>A grand celebration was held there on the <date value="03-28">28th March,</date> which was styled the &#x0022;inauguration exercises of the great National Fair, for the benefit of the <rs>Fanian Brotherhood</rs>,&#x0022; (<rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>.) The speeches on the occasion were full of glorification of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, and of pledges for her independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It is enough to say that the inauguration address was delivered by <persName n="Wentworth,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="default:Wentworth,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Wentworth</surname></persName>, of infamous notoriety, to satisfy all that <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName> has little to hope from this <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>To blend with sighs and lamentations for the liberties of his own country, bloody resolutions against the liberties of another, and that of a people who are it peace with his, is <num value="1">one</num> of the remarkable Illustrations of the bad effects of living among <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--the most depraved and faithless people on earth.
