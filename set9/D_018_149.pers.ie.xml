<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The debate in the <orgName n="South Carolina Convention" type="convention">South Carolina Convention</orgName> about &#x0022;the hereafter,&#x0022; is important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, before the adoption of the <name>Ordinance</name> of Secession, <persName n="Dunkin,Chancellor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Dunkin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chancellor">Chancellor</roleName> <surname>Dunkin</surname></persName>, who was on the committee to prepare it, made the following speech: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> I do not know that any particular amendment is of very much consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I suppose that the committee will have authority to take into consideration what has been termed postal arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>[A voice--&#x0022;That's so.&#x0022;] It is very difficult to define and distinguish; but when you come to consider what we have to do, it will be no great stretch to say that a Committee on Commercial Relations might take into consideration our postal arrangements as a part of commercial transactions; and I did suppose, when my friend submitted his resolution for appointing the committee, that it would have full authority, and with due deference to the gentleman, whom I greatly respect, I would desire that there might be a question upon this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I do not believe the <rs>Convention</rs> entertains a doubt about the committee, that they may, if they think proper, take into consideration postal arrangements. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has done me honor by placing me on the <rs>Committee</rs> to prepare an Ordinance for the withdrawal of this State from what has been called the &#x0022;<orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.&#x0022; I do not think I act in violation of confidence as a member of that committee to say that upon the matter confided to them they are united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>[Smothered applause.] That if any delay takes place it will be simply for the purpose of preparing an Ordinance in a manner consistent with its effect, and the dignity of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Sir, I am sure that Ordinance will be submitted to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We have been working this morning, and again will work this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We do not intend to be hasty, but we propose to lose no time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We are anxiously engaged in it, and I say, without violation of confidence, we are engaged only upon the matter of form, and upon that we shall not be long in agreeing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I will, in the remarks I intend offering, assume that this State will be out of the <rs>Union</rs> in a very few days, if not in as many hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Then, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, we have something to look to for many purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The Union has worked well &mdash; the machinery is convenient and advantageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In small matters, very convenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Sir, having a determination to go out of the <rs>Union</rs>, we should endeavor to do so with as little harm to the ordinary transactions of the community as practicable and consistent with the position we have assumed and the character which we propose to maintain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Sir, the machinery has worked well, and you cannot stop it suddenly unless you get some break in it in some way. Sir, I cannot illustrate what I desire to say in a better manner than by referring to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> matter to be considered &mdash; the commercial relations, or the marine relations, if you please to call them so &mdash; the forts, harbors and custom-houses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> This is the most important subject, and the great purpose of the <rs>Committee</rs>, and I cannot illustrate or elaborate, but merely suggest <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in reference to the <rs type="place">Custom-House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The conduct of the gentleman who now occupies the <name>Collectorship</name> of the <name>Port</name>, and who has not illustrated to me his idea, has been most commendable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Sir, all I know I read in the newspapers, I know nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I saw the <rs>Collector</rs> a few times directly after the announcement of the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The feelings of that gentleman would then have promptly caused him to instantly have thrown up his commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He did not desire for <num value="1">one</num> minute to remain an officer of the <rs>National Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But, sir, what would have happened if an immediate acceptance had taken place in the reception of his resignation at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had he have forwarded his commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Sir, it is well known to every man in the country that if <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> had received it, and appointed another to fill the thrown up commission, no Southern man would have accepted it &mdash; no man of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> would have been allowed to do it.--[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Sir, <persName n="Colcock,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Colcock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Colcock</surname></persName> saw, and he is a practical man, that if he had sent in his commission and it, had been accepted, as I presume it would, what would have been the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I ask any man who knows anything of the commercial relations of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, what would have been the consequence!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>All the power of the <rs>British</rs> navy would not have more effectually stopped the port of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is well known that if a vessel passes the bar of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> without the regular papers, signed by the <rs>Collector</rs> of the <name>Port</name>, that vessel is liable to be taken up in <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> as a vagrant or pirate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>No vessel would venture that peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The Collector knew this and he did not forward his commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He gave notice that he would resign &mdash; that he would hold his commission subject to the directions of the <rs>Convention</rs> of the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> when here assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He knew that a sudden stoppage would have been accompanied by the most mischievous consequences.--He is prepared now, and he holds his commission under the direction and at the will of the <rs>Convention</rs>, or of this body to which he expects to owe allegiance, and to whom he allows allegiance alone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Let us pass, then, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, to the postal arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><persName><foreName>Mirabeau</foreName></persName>, many years ago, said that the fiercest insurrections were those which arose from the stomachs of a people without bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They won't hear, they won't reason, and the voice of patriotism is dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Sir, next to bread, in our artificial state of society, is light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I do not mean the glorious light of the <name>Heavens</name> &mdash; I mean that information and intelligence is next to bread.--People must have information &mdash; they must have light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If, sir, you suddenly withdraw this light &mdash; if for <num value="8">eight</num> and <measure n="40hours" type="date">forty hours</measure> a casual interruption in postal arrangements occurs, you stop the means of communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Why, sir, the perilous consequences which would result from it will be easily appreciated by every thinking mind in every corner of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It should, therefore, not be done suddenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We should have a little time to effect common arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is to be done by a Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Don't let me be misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I assume that we will to-morrow take the attitude of a sovereign State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I will assume that the national men at the head of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, when the matter is presented to them, will see the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>We assume that our rights must be recognized.--Without that they will soon be prepared to hear that we are out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>By slowly acting they will then be prepared to treat with us in relation to commerce, upon postal arrangements, and upon any and all other matters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Let me say, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I don't use this argument in reliance upon their good feeling toward us, but from their interests &mdash; interests as important to them as to us. For such action time should be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>If in the instance of a co-partnership time is proposed to close it up, and make the necessary arrangements, it is but reasonable that the time be given to effect the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>You cannot act until you are out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The object should therefore be to make temporary arrangements, and that very soon, so as to keep up commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We should place the postal arrangements, which I consider a part of the great commercial relations of the country, in such a position as to keep them up until we hear whether the <rs>Government</rs> is prepared to say yea or any. If yes, there will be no difficulty &mdash; if nay, then for a resort to the experiment of managing things for ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I have said that I got my information about the <rs>Collector</rs> from the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>As to the <name>Postmasters</name> of the <rs>State</rs>, I think I may say the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>For a number of them, I know I can say they are ready, and they are only desirous of knowing from this Convention what is proper for them to do for the welfare and the advancement of this great cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>But for the <rs>Postmaster</rs> of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> I have a right to speak a little more authentically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I say, sir, that at this very moment he is prepared to put his commission in the hands of the <rs>Governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs> to be forwarded to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post-Office Department</orgName>, whenever in the opinion of the <rs>Government</rs>, through this Convention expressed, it shall be deemed expedient for the welfare of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, to which alone, after its withdrawal, he will look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I do him injustice, however, and come short of all I should say. He has lived to the time appointed for man, and rather beyond it, and I say that, in view of all the difficulties and troubles he may have encountered in that long period of time, and the aid which his salary affords him in his old age, he is prepared to put his commission this night in the hands of the <rs>Governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> Now, sir, since we know what the <rs>Collector</rs> will do, and what the <name>Postmasters</name> throughout the <rs>State</rs> are prepared to do, I will state that I have a resolution which I intend to offer to this Committee, not merely for them, but to find out what temporary or permanent arrangements it is expedient to adopt in reference to the withdrawal of this State from the <rs>Union</rs>, for commercial and postal arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>I suppose that the <rs>Committee</rs> will only report after it has conferred with the <rs>Governor</rs>, so that it is better not to disturb the ordinary relations, at least not until it is ascertained what is proposed to be done with the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Some gentlemen in the <rs>Committee</rs> suggest an allowance of <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> for a conference &mdash; some suggest <num value="1">one</num> month, and some suggest a longer time &mdash; say <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, or after the assembling of the <num value="2">two</num> Conventions of our sister States, which meet on the <date value="01-07">7th of January</date> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> and <num value="1">one</num> on the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> of the same month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It was suggested that a temporary arrangement could go into operation on the <date value="01-20">20th of January,</date> so that time be given to the <rs>General Government</rs> to know our views and be ready to answer yea or nay whether they are disposed to treat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>But in the meantime the ordinary operations of our citizens are to go on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> <num value="1">One</num> matter more as to the revenues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The Postmaster of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> would most likely keep an account until the transaction was settled after <date value="01-17">January 17th.</date> My friend from <placeName reg="Saint Michael, Cambria, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2092746">St. Michael</placeName> has well proposed that the money received by the <rs>Postmaster</rs> should be considered in account, and settled with the <rs>General Government</rs> the day of the ratification of the <name>Ordinance</name>, as adopted by this Convention &mdash; that a month hence all matters can be arranged between us as between <num value="2">two</num> independent nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In the meantime, the accounts should go on, so that no sudden disruption shall take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Sir, I merely suggest this as spoken by others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> I learn that <persName n="Cobb,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Cobb,Howell,,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Cobb</surname></persName> has said that the revenue of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> from the <rs type="place">Custom-House</rs> would not near pay the expense of the <rs type="place">Custom-House</rs> for the last quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I also learn from the best authority that the <name>Post</name>-Offices of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> cost the <rs>Government</rs> from <num value="30000">thirty</num> to <measure n="40000dollars" type="currency">forty thousand dollars</measure> per quarter, and that the receipts have been less than <measure n="50000dollars" type="currency">fifty thousand dollars</measure> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Therefore, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, there need be no great apprehension on this score.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But the accounts should, nevertheless, be kept in the meantime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The usual business transactions should be allowed to proceed until it is ascertained what are the views and how the matter is regarded by the <name>Administration</name>, which I have no doubt are entirely friendly to us, and will do everything that can be done in order to prevent any inconvenience. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>But when we are about to consummate this great act without the good will and wishes of many of the <name>States</name> of this Confederacy, it is important that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> should know if the rights claimed in behalf of this Government were to be exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Would it be well to inquire whether she shall defer her rights to be exercised within the limits of her own State?--<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> affirms it to be his right, his constitutional duty, and high obligation, to protect what he calls the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within the limits of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, after the secession of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> from the limits of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>And it is true, sir, that he says he has no constitutional power to coerce the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> after she shall secede, while at the same time he denies her the exercise of her legitimate right of secession, which she claims; and I apprehend there will be, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, an attempt to coerce the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> in the form of protecting the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within the limits of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>I am disposed, therefore, at the very threshold of the movement, to contest the accuracy of the logic and weigh well the conclusion which the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has arrived at in his consideration of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>There never has been a day &mdash; no, nor an hour &mdash; in which anybody could claim the right of the property within the limits of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, whether the claim be made by an individual or a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Is it not as sacred under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>--and as sacred as when that right is claimed by <num value="1">one</num> of our own citizens?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>After the act of secession it will receive only that protection which it has hitherto received &mdash; I mean that protection which has been derived from the laws of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>. </p> </q><bibl n="Judge Magrath"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, look at it. There is property which, while we were in the <rs>Union</rs>, belonged to the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>As an independent State, has it been protected by the arms of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>When was it, sir, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> considered it necessary, within the limits of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, to consider this property needful of that material protection which it seems disposed to assert for it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Is it because the act of secession makes the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> occupy in the eyes of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the position of robbers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>So potentially is it asserted that the rights of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are only to be maintained in our limits by material force?--No!

It must be remembered that when <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> secedes from this Union, her sovereign rights arise and are to be considered in connection with this assertion of the right of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>I desire, however, as the discussion has progressed thus far, to say a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I am, as members are already perhaps aware, very recently from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>I went there with my colleagues for the purpose of informing myself as thoroughly and as carefully as possible, of all matters which I considered as bearing upon the welfare and prosperity of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> My colleagues and myself considered it desirable that we should confer with the members from the other Southern States, that we might have full information upon all that concerns the interests and domestic affairs of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>We went there not as spies, but as vigilant sentinels, and to procure all information which we could conceive of as valuable for our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The remarks of my honored friend appear to me calculated to give a very wrong impression on the minds of the people of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I have not the remotest idea that the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will send any reinforcements to the forts in our harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>I would say now frankly, for I desire no concealment, and I do not think there should be at this time anything of the kind among the members of this great body, but with perfect frankness I will state here that I and some of my colleagues, in a conversation with the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and subsequently in a written communication addressed to him at his request, we did say this, after speaking of the great excitement about the forts and preparations and rumors, &#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, it is our solemn conviction, if you attempt to send a solitary soldier down to those forts, the instant the intelligence reaches our people &mdash; and we shall take care that it does reach them &mdash; the forts will certainly be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We would urge them to do it, and would go home to help in the work, because that would be a matter of self- defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It would be suicidal folly to allow <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> or the others to be manned.&#x0022; We further said, it is our conviction that the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">S. Carolina</placeName> would not touch those forts or do anything to molest its garrison prior to the meeting of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>We were perfectly sure of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>We also hoped and believed that nothing would be done after that until we had a formal adjustment with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, or until those forts were demanded by the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>That was the substance of our communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>And I say again, that there is not an intention to reinforce the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>What do we now see at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>We see the <name>Premier</name> &mdash; the right hand man of the <name>Administration</name>, a near and dear personal friend of the <rs>President</rs> &mdash; retiring from the <rs>Cabinet</rs> on that precise issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has resisted, and allowed a Cabinet officer to withdraw, rather than to yield to the proposition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> Now, is it natural after such an act that the <rs>President</rs> should vacillate and concede to other influences that which he so strongly and promptly refused to a personal friend in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>I cannot believe it. I cannot think he would be so weak, so vacillating, so uncertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>I, therefore, feel, as I said, that there is not the slightest earthly reason to expect that the <name>Administration</name> will reinforce the garrison, and if he should do it, it is utterly impossible that he could do it without our getting ample and timely notice, and anticipate the arrival of the troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> Now, look at it as practical, common-sense men. Do any of you desire any more?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Does any honorable gentleman on this floor wish to provoke a collision with the <rs>General Government</rs>, and to precipitate that collision with other States involved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Do we wish to present to the gaze of men in sight of the civilized world, a State noted for courage as the spectacle of cowardice and weakness, instead of retiring peaceably and with dignity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>We owe it to ourselves before the nations of the world, the strength of our position before the tribunal of the country, the strength of our position before Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that we do not strike before we are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assailed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> Now, what is the position of those forts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>A handful of men in <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, numbering <num value="65">sixty- five</num>, musicians and all told, <num value="70">seventy</num>; actually so small that they are, as their <rs type="role2">Commander</rs> said, actually worn out from physical labor; yet the <rs>President</rs> has not reinforced them, though urged to do so. Have we any apprehensions that these <num value="65">sixty-five</num> men will injure the peace and security of the city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Have you the least suspicion that these men will turn their guns and fire upon the people? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> We are told that these works are strongly fortified and entrenched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>If I was in the same position as the officer of that fort, I would do as he has done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>He is there with few troops, and is obliged to make these preparations for his own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>His preparations are for the protection of the lives of that handful of men. Where is the reason; then, that we should be excited, or that it should touch the nerves of the least sensitive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>As to the works at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, so much the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Let the <rs>General Government</rs> spend as much money as it chooses, and employ as many laborers as are necessary, and put it in a good condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>I say, so much the better &mdash; it must eventually be ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We have believed, and often expressed the belief, that, by a general and united demand of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, every right which they possess and every guarantee which they require would be conceded by the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<head>Fallacies.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> In all the <rs>Northern</rs> and <rs>English</rs> newspapers which treat of affairs in the <rs>South</rs>, we find a disposition to exaggerate the difficulties arising from the necessity of keeping in subjection the slave population of this quarter of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>It is, of course, viewed in different lights, according to the disposition of the writer; but by all, even by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, we are represented as reposing upon a mine of gunpowder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>To our friends in the <rs>North</rs> and in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> we would say, give yourselves no apprehension upon that head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>To our enemies we would venture to suggest that they are reckoning without their host in expecting aid from such <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> We will venture to say, that the system of slavery in the <rs>Southern States</rs> of this Union, has presented fewer cases of riot, insubordination, and insurrection, from its foundation to the present day, and has been the parent of less bloodshed, than any other system of labor that ever existed the same length of time.--We believe that more lives were lost in the single insurrection of <placeName reg="Southampton, Hampshire, England" key="tgn,7011385">Southampton</placeName>, (lives of masters, we mean,) than in all the other slave risings that were ever attempted put together, and the lives lost in that case did not amount to <num value="60">sixty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>It is impossible to conceive anything more hopeless than the success of a slave rebellion, in any part of the <rs>South</rs>, and the slaves know this as well as their masters.--Even the proclamation of freedom, made by a royal Governor, backed by a fleet and army, to all slaves who would rise in the cause of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.,</hi> failed to produce a single case even of mutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>A single riot in a manufacturing town in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has often occasioned more bloodshed than all the slave insurrections that ever took place in the <rs>Southern States</rs> of this Union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> Our enemies represent us as living in a state of constant terror from this cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Nothing was ever farther from the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Timid persons there are, undoubtedly among the slaveholders, who are afraid of everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>But they are rare exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The great body of the slaveholders pass their time in as much tranquility as any other class of persons whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>They do not fear the negroes, because they treat them well; because they know that the negroes are too well aware of the folly of attempting what must end in their own inevitable destruction, and because, with very few exceptions, they are perfectly contented with their lot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> Another fallacy indulged in by the class of Northern men who draw their ideas of the <rs>South</rs> from <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Helper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Helper,nomatch:0"><surname>Helper</surname></persName>'s</hi> book, is, that the white men of the <rs>South</rs> who own no negroes would gladly see the slaves emancipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Now, the non-slaveholders, strange as it may seem to the abolitionists, are the very men, of all others, who are most jealous of Northern interference with the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>They hate abolitionism and abolitionists far more than the great slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>There are several reasons for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>In the first place, every man of them looks forward to the day when he may become a slaveholder himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Secondly, every <num value="1">one</num> of them is connected in some way or other with persons who own slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Thirdly, they have been bred up among slaves, and are generally conservative in their views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Fourthly, they know that if the negroes were emancipated this would be no country for the white man, and that while the rich could get away, they would be compelled to live among them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> Much stress is laid by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Helper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Helper,nomatch:0"><surname>Helper</surname></persName></hi> upon the fact that there are only <num value="350000">350,000</num> slaveholders, old and young, male and female.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>He forgets that every <num value="1">one</num> of these has numerous connections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He overlooks the <num value="350000">350,000</num> overseers, who derive their maintenance from slavery, and who, never having been accustomed to manual labor, would be like so many fish out of water were slavery abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>He forgets that these are all men in the prime of existence, men of bone and muscle &mdash; men of spirit and energy &mdash; an immense army of themselves, <num value="350000">350,000</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Give to each of these men a wife and <num value="3">three</num> children, and you will find at once nearly <num value="2000000">two millions</num> interested in slavery, and dependent upon it, from this source alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Helper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Helper,nomatch:0"><surname>Helper</surname></persName></hi> overlooked all this, and the followers of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Helper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Helper,nomatch:0"><surname>Helper</surname></persName></hi> continually overlook it when they calculate upon finding the non-slaveholders favorable to their schemes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> sports another fallacy with great persistency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>It is trying to prove that the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">State of Massachusetts</placeName> is worth more than all the cotton States, and says that <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> alone produces more than <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> more than a dozen South Carolinas rolled into <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>The stranger, who was a large, stout-looking man, heavily bearded, paused before the door that led into the bar-room, and peeped inquisitively in; seeing a small group sitting around the table, he walked very leisurely toward them, introducing himself in a frank, easy style. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/> The stranger commenced to smoke, eyeing the company with a nonchalance and familiarity that took them completely by surprise. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/> &#x0022;Vot yer doing here for?&#x0022; growled a dark-visaged, ugly-looking scoundrel, whose pox-marked face was half obscured by a dirty cap. He rose as he spoke, and drew out a sharp knife. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>No <num value="1">one</num> entertained a greater admiration of the <name>Tomtit</name> than that gentleman: he regarded him with the same deference a dog would show to his master, and was contented as long as he could testify his servile affection; he quickly returned with the lantern and key, and to his great surprise found the burglar chief absorbed in the contemplation of the miniature of a young girl, seemingly some <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> of age, and of surpassing loveliness, and heard him mutter, &#x0022;He certainly has good cause to hate me, but I would have spared him had he kept away from &#x0027;the <rs type="place">Nest</rs>.&#x0027; Now, however, he has rushed upon his doom!&#x0022; Then, becoming aware of Beg's presence, the <name>Tomtit</name> hastily thrust the picture in his bosom, and turning to the inn-keeper, whispered: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/> &#x0022;Let me out by the back-door, Beg.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/> &#x0022;All right,&#x0022; was the quiet response. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/> &#x0022;Not a word to the boys, mind; if they miss me, tell 'em I've gone to bed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/> The <rs>Tomtit</rs>, with this parting caution, made his exit from the door, which <persName n="Beg,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00510" reg="mostcommon:Beg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beg</surname></persName> held open, and walked rapidly off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/> The faithful custodian of the <rs type="place">Burglars' Nest</rs> stood for a few minutes listening, till the retreating footsteps of the burglar chief had died away in the distance; then he carefully closed and relocked the door, and returned to the bar, there to muse over the surprising and startling disclosures which the <name>Tomtit</name> had made to him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/> It was <num value="1">one</num> of those remarkable circumstances that sometimes happen in real life, that <persName n="Duffy,Mister,Detective,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00511" reg="default:Duffy,Detective,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Detective</foreName> <surname>Duffy</surname></persName> should have unconsciously blundred into the very place he had been searching for vainly the past <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. As he sat quietly eating his supper, he little dreamt that a few yards off stood a figure which, the mere sight of, would have moved him to an absolute frenzy; and well it might &mdash; for there was a story connected with that figure, a tale so heart- rending, so terrible, so revolting &mdash; of faith broken, of hospitality abused, of wrongs perpetrated, of an idolized daughter consigned to wretchedness &mdash; that it could not have been passed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>It had left its impress on the care-worn features of that old man, discernible in every lineament; his grey eyes seemed to flash with the same spirit,--of deep, absorbing revenge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/> And now those <num value="2">two</num> men were about to meet &mdash; the <name>Detective</name> known to the <name>Burglar</name>, the <name>Burglar</name> unknown to the <name>Detective</name> &mdash; to engage in a desperate game, the issue of which was to be death to <num value="1">one</num> or both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Intelligence and honesty were to be pitted against cunning and crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>What was to be the result of this fearful struggle and thirst for vengeance, we shall be able to see in our next chapter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/> The above is all of this story that will be published in our columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>The continuation of it from where it leaves off here can be found only in the <hi rend="smallcaps">New York Ledger, </hi> the great family paper, which is for sale at all the stores throughout the city and country, where papers are sold.
