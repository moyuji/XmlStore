<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> A statement appears in the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>, of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st inst.</day></dateStruct>, purporting to give an account of the facts attending the advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops upon <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, which <unclear> bour</unclear> in grave errors, some of which <unclear>de</unclear> a speedy and authentic correction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>I have therefore determined to place the facts <unclear></unclear> disposed, and leave my name as <unclear></unclear> for this narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The article in the <unclear></unclear> affirms, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that the <q>&#x0022;civil authorities&#x0022;</q> of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> were unwilling that <unclear></unclear> Confederate troops should make resistance <unclear></unclear> the advance of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Secondly, <unclear></unclear> the said authorities prepared terms of <unclear>surrender&#x0022;</unclear> and sent them under a flag of <unclear></unclear> by a committee, of whom <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Clark,,Pelag,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Clark,Pelag,,,"><foreName>Pelag</foreName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, Northern man by birth, was chairman.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Now, each of these statements iserroneouns, <unclear></unclear> will appear from the following narrative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The report of the advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> <unclear></unclear> reached <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>; as late as <time value="12am">midnight</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, <unclear></unclear> Field, who was in command of the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops, assured citizens that the <unclear></unclear> not believe, from the reports brought in <unclear></unclear> his pickets, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force was sufficient to threaten an attack which involved <unclear></unclear> occupation of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The citizens and the civil authorities&#x0022; reated, therefore, <unclear>hope</unclear> on the relief that <persName n="Field,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Field,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Field</surname></persName> a troops <unclear></unclear> and save the town from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <unclear></unclear> This hope was sadly cursed, for <unclear></unclear> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> it was discovered by the citizens that the bridges across the river were in names, and that the <rs>Confederate</rs> troop were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acting from <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName> and making their way through <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> into the country back of it. I have no <unclear></unclear> to criticizes our General or his troops, <unclear></unclear> it is due to the citizens and <q>&#x0022;civil authorities&#x0022;</q> to say, that they were solely distressed when they found that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were not <unclear></unclear> and beaten back <unclear></unclear> was this <unclear></unclear> lessened when they found that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force consisted of a single brigaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>For <unclear></unclear> it was not until <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> that an accession of force was added to the <unclear></unclear> brigade, before which our troops retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><unclear></unclear> may appear that our officers did not know that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force was so small, or that they were erroneously informed as to its strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> By <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had planted their cannon so as to command the town, and a regiment of their cavalry appeared near the river, which was <persName n="Torrance,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Torrance,nomatch:0"><surname>Torrance</surname></persName> at several points, not much over knee deep <persName n="Field,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Field,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Field</surname></persName>'s entire force had evacuated the town, and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> lay at the feet of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <orgName n="Common Council" type="council">common Council</orgName> was convened by the <rs>Mayor</rs>, and assembled in the presence of a few citizens who were invited to and their deliberations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This body determined, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to send no message to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General until a communication was received from him; secondly, that so soon as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officer sent a communication, that a response should be made, which response I now copy and send you for publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Whether this response is worthy of the fair fame and patriotic spirit of the <q>&#x0022;Old Burg,&#x0022;</q> I leave to Southern criticism to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A committee, consisting of the <rs>Mayor</rs>, <num value="2">two</num> Councilmen, and <num value="3">three</num> citizens, all to the manor born, good men and true, were delegated to deliver this response. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> About <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> a white flag was waved from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines across the river, and the signal was answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A Federal officer came across the river, and handed to the committee (who had repaired to the river to await his arrival) a written request from <persName n="Auger,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Auger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</roleName> <surname>Auger</surname></persName> that he might have an interview with the civil authorities of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>An arrangement was <unclear></unclear> made by which the committee were invited to see <persName n="Auger,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Auger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Auger</surname></persName> at his headquarters, near <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName>, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. The committee went <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> and had an interview with this General, and delivered the response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I deem at proper to add, for the information of your readers, that <persName n="Auger,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Auger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Auger</surname></persName> gave no satisfaction to the committee as to whether the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army would pay for army supplies taken from <unclear></unclear> and also admitted that slaves coming into the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines would be sheltered and <unclear></unclear> against reclamation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Justice to the people and authorities of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> requires that this much should be published, in order to correct the <unclear></unclear> and baseless gossip circulating as to the mode of our occupation by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> As a general thing it is low and flat, boggy, heavy, and covered with a thick undergrowth, with here and there a succession of forests and fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>In the immediate vicinity of the battle- ground the surface is more undulating, and the various ridges afford natural entrenchments, from behind which the enemy was enabled to pour in a most destructive fire, and make a determined stand. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> As you are already informed by telegraph, the <rs>Confederates</rs> on this occasion acted wholly upon the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Early in the week <rs>Beauregard</rs> and <rs>Johnston</rs> had information of the contemplated advance of the enemy as soon as a union of the forces under <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="nearbymention:Buell,Gen,,,"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> and his front division, which was commanded in detail by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wallace,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="nearbymention:Wallace,J.,Gordon,,"><surname>Wallace</surname></persName>, <persName n="McClernand,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:McClernand,nomatch:0"><surname>McClernand</surname></persName>, <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Prentiss,nomatch:0"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="mostcommon:Smith,nomatch:0"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, could be effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>To prevent this wholesale demonstration, it was determined to press the issue without delay. --Orders were published to our army to prepare <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations, and put itself in light marching order; and on Saturday the preparations on our side were complete, and most of the brigades were in position within <placeName><distance reg="2.5miles">two and a half miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>I forgot to mention, by the way, that this is the name of a small town, distant from the river between <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>, and was occupied by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The point nearest to this on the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, is <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg Landing</placeName>, where they held their reserves, stores, guns, and ammunitions, under cover of their gunboats.--These were only <num value="3">three</num> in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>I have heard it stated that the plan of the battle is commonly due to the genius of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, but I have no doubt that it was equally the result of the strategic ability and experience of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, <persName n="Johnston,,Albert,Sidney,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="default:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The idea was to form <num value="3">three</num> parallel lines &mdash; the front, centre, and rear &mdash; each line having its centre and <num value="2">two</num> flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The rear constituted the reserve, and the artillery was distributed between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> lines.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> our troops lay upon their arms almost within sight of the enemy, eager, hopeful and determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The attack commenced <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at day break, our advance moving warmly forward to their bloody work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The line of the <rs>Federals</rs>, commencing at <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, extended thence to the right, a distance of about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>. Their camps were just to the rear, arranged, so to speak, in a stratum <num value="3">three</num> deep, and to the eye presented <num value="1">one</num> of the most beautiful spectacles that could touch a soldier's heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> From daylight until a little after <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> the fighting was principally between the pickets and skirmishers, but at the latter hour, a portion of our main body appearing in sight, fire opened with artillery, and for an hour or more <num value="1">one</num> heard nothing but the incessant uprear of the heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Our men, though unaccustomed to the iron hall, received the once coolly, awaiting the orders to rise from their recumbent position and advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>In the time these came, and thenceforward through the day, brave and disciplined as were the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, nothing seemed capable of resisting the desperate valor of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The enemy fell like chaff before the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Broken in ranks, they rallied behind trees and in the underbrush, only to be again repulsed and driven back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> It is impossible to follow the several evolutions of the <num value="2">two</num> armies &mdash; the pressing forward here, the retreating there, the attempts to <unclear></unclear> flank each other, and the minor details of the right, in which we were everywhere victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>This cannot be expected so soon after the battle, and, indeed, must be left to the regard of official reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>But there are yet a few points apparent to the eye of a correspondent which may convey some idea of the progress of the fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> At <time value="8:30">half past 8</time> in the morning a grand charge was ordered upon the enemy's camp, <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName> directing the movement.--<num value="3">Three</num> regiments composing a part of the <orgName>brigade of <persName n="Gladden,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Gladden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gladden</surname></persName></orgName>, and consisting of Louisianian, Mississippians, and Alabamians, were assigned the undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>They did their work like heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The enemy fought desperately, and with the advantage of immense odds in both men and guns; but they could not stand the trial, and after vainly endeavoring to hold their ground, retreated in confusion, leaving in our possession <num value="4">four</num> batteries arms ammunition, and <hi rend="italics">material</hi> of war. Of these batteries the <orgName type="regiment" key="1LARegular">First Louisiana regulars</orgName> took <num value="1">one</num>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL21">Twenty first Alabama</orgName> took <num value="2">two</num>, and the combined brigade the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> <unclear>-ow</unclear> followed a series of daring, desperate and successful charges, the various regiments and brigades rolling rapidly forward to the sound of enthusiastic cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In all of these both general and field officers displayed a bravely that amounted to sheer recklessness, frequently leading the men into the very teeth of the opposing fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It was these inspiring examples of personal valor which made our troops invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> himself, finding a regiment wavering under the rain of death that was decimating its ranks, dashed to the front, seized the battle flag, and waving it over his head, shouted, <q> &#x0022;Follow your General!&#x0022;</q> In an instant every man's heart appeared to undergo a change, which made him firm as a rock, and, with a wild yell, the command rushed forward and drove the enemy from his position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> At <time value="2:30">half-past 2</time>, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Folk,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He also was leading a charge upon the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> camp of the enemy.--<persName n="Harris,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Harris,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of his aids, had left him a few moments before to convey an order, and as he was making his report to him on his return, he discovered that he had been twice wounded, once in the body by a sling ball, and in the leg with the fragment of a shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Still the noble General maintained his position on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/><q>&#x0022;Are you badly hurt?&#x0022;</q> was the inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/><q>&#x0022;Yes, Governor, I think this as a mortal wound,&#x0022;</q> at the same time pointing to his leg. <persName n="Harris,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Harris,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName> immediately dismounted assisted <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Folk,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> from his horse, and there upon the ground, amid the roar of artillery and the cheers of his victorious army, the great commander quietly breathed his last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> Prudently the information was kept from the army, and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> assured the command-in- chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>So the fight went on until <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, when the enemy were in full retreat towards the river and our forces were closing upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/><persName n="Prentiss,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Prentiss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> had been captured, with some <num value="3500">three thousand five hundred</num> men, flag after flag was sent to the rear, and the ground was strewn with arms and munitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>By dark the <rs>Federals</rs> were under caver of their gunboats, and we could do no more than halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>All that the enemy owned except what was in their hands, was in our possession artillery small arms, baggage leads, transportation wagons, &#x0026;c. We accordingly retired to their camps, and here rested for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>To give you a description of the scenes in these camps would be impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> prolonged revel, but without drink, among the luxuries of Northern fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Everything that heart could wish was in abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>There were apples, cakes, meats, preserves, flour, clothing, butter, cheese, hams, money, trinkets, letters,--in a word, all the private and confidential enjoyments which false and expense could afford the soldier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> Yet we were notice in other ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It was believed that the attack would be resumed on the ensuing day, and our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> prepared for the event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Troops were assigned their positions, and everything made ready for the expected demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Our wounded, too, required attention, and hundreds were carried from the field to the hospitals in the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> Our losses, great as they are, cannot be as heavy as those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Our killed outright may possibly amount to <num value="400">four hundred</num>, which, I think, is a liberal estimate.--<num value="200">Two hundred</num> more will die from their wounds, the balance of the casualties is not less than <num value="3000">three thousand</num>. <num value="1">One</num> can judge, however, only from the terrible execution in the various regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> battalions <num value="300">three hundred</num> out of <num value="400">four hundred</num> were wounded; in other corps half the men were injured, and in all an unusually large proportion suffered from the destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It is a remarkable fact, and <num value="1">one</num> that has generally attracted attention, that <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of the wounds are in the head or extremities, and the large majority comparatively slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Every other wounded soldier you meet has either his arm in a sling, or is limping upon <num value="1">one</num> foot, while scores are moving about the camp grazed in the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> young lad of <num value="16">sixteen</num>, who had been struck by glancing shots upon the head <num value="4">four</num> times, and had his clothes perforated in a dozen places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>I may add here, <hi rend="italics">on passant,</hi> that <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> had several shots through his dress, and lost <num value="3">three</num> valuable horses that were shot under him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> Hair-breadth escapes were numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/><num value="1">One</num> officer while giving an order to his men received a ball in the cheek, which passed through to the other side without touching tongue on tooth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Another had his tongue shot out; another was struck in the forehead, and the ball passed completely over the top of his head a sort of <hi rend="italics">ricochet</hi> under the skin. --But it is impossible to detail the numerous incidents now. They may form the material for other letters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> Many of the <rs>Kentucky</rs> and <rs>Tennessee</rs> regiments fought more like furies than men.--Comrades fell all around them, but nothing could shake the desperate determination, which seemed to possess them to conquer or die. Nor were the <name>Mississippians</name>, Alabamians, Louisianian, or Arkansans, behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Every man did his duty nobly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The orders </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> were few, the firing was at will, and <num value="1000">thousands</num> no doubt fell before the unerring aim of the rifles, muskets and shot guns of our men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> My letter last night gave you a hurried and skeleton account of the battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>I believe I intimated that <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> anticipated a demonstration on the ensuing morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Our scouts had brought intelligence that <num value="7000">7,000</num> Federals were at <placeName reg="Crump's Landing">Crump's Landing</placeName>, <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> below, and that the river was lined with transports, from which the enemy had disembarked during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>It was known, also, or rather believed, that another <orgName>division of <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="nearbymention:Buell,Gen,,,"><surname>Buell</surname></persName></orgName>'s <orgName n="army">army</orgName>, probably accompanied by <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="nearbymention:Buell,Gen,,,"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> in person, was approaching on the previous day, and had doubtless arrived at the scene. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> Vigorous preparations were therefore made to resist the assault, which was deemed almost certain at an early hour on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.--Nor were these ill timed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Those of our troops who had not been marching during the night were somewhat refreshed by their few hours'sleep, although a drenching rain had poured in torrents, and daylight in the morning found our army in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The fight commenced in the usual way. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> our pickets were driven in, then the skirmishers met, and in due time an advance was made upon our centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>At the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire it was evident that we had a new, fresh, and more formidable foe to encounter than that of the day before--<num value="1">one</num> which it would require all of our energies to repel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The battle soon raged fast and furious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The Federals brought battery after battery to the field, and we in turn played upon them with our own artillery, making havoc in their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Their men stood up well, and fought as if conscious of the fate which would await them if defeated.--They had, besides, a repulse to retrieve, and, under the inspiration of these sentiments, it was not without obstinately contesting every inch of ground that they gave way. Western men were pitted against those of their own blood and habits &mdash; men as fierce and determined as themselves, whom nothing but mere force of numbers could shake &mdash; and the contest was as an encounter between lions and tigers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It was emphatically <q>&#x0022;give and take.&#x0022;</q> Now we would repulse them; then they would repulse us, and thus, advancing and retreating, the battle was vigorously maintained until near <time value="2.5oclock">2&#x00BD; o'clock</time> in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Neither army had gained a foot of advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>We still held the ground on which the battle of the day commenced &mdash; namely, <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> the other side of their own camps; but it became evident at <time value="12pm">noon</time> that we could make no headway against the immense reinforcements that were constantly thrown forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>If we whipped <num value="1">one</num> regiment, its place was certain to be felted by <num value="2">two</num> others, and frequently we had to meet them <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>This was the case with the <orgName type="regiment" key="KY3">3d Kentucky</orgName> and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the <rs>Arkansas</rs> regiments at different times during the day; but our men quelled not, and, though they were decimated and cut to pieces by the murderous fire, they maintained their position like negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>No battle in the world has ever been fought with more desperation, or a greater display of moral and physical heroism, than was manifested on this occasion by the <rs>Southern</rs> troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/> Discovering the condition of affairs, <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> made his preparations to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The wounded were sent back; ammunition trains fell to the rear; cavalry was set to work to destroy the property in the camps of the enemy; batteries were concentrated on the front to cover the retreat, and thus, in good order, the army fell back to the <rs>Federal</rs> camp, and thence, at night fall, towards <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/> Simultaneously with the cessation of our firing that on the enemy also stopped, and their troops knees moved back, without the slightest attempt at pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>They had gained nothing; we had lost nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>It was emphatically a drawn battle, and the <rs>Federal</rs> commander is doubtless well pleased that it was so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/> But for <num value="1">one</num> circumstance, however, I believe yet that the day might have been ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of men were more intent upon securing plunder than in defending it. <num value="1000">Thousands</num> went off with their wounded friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Thus regiments became demoralized, companies separated, and frequently the men would find themselves fighting among strangers from another State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Had the same discipline been observed as in the <rs>Federal</rs> army, there is not a doubt that, notwithstanding the immense odds against us, we should have whipped the enemy and driven him into another <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> rout across the <rs>Tennessee</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> Under the circumstances we could do no better than to retreat to reorganize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>As long as the <rs>Federals</rs> could remain intact and secure under their gunboats, it was useless to risk the chances of defeat ourselves, and the result is that we are just as strong to-day, except in the numerical deduction on account of casualties, as on the memorable <rs>Sunday</rs>.--Our troops are ready for another encounter, and, if possible, will fight harder than before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/> While on this point, let me throw it out as a suggestion to some of the governmental thinkers at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, that a reward of money should be offered to every man who, while sticking to his post throughout an engagement, shall bring away with him, whenever practicable, in addition to his own musket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/> Federal gun. Hundreds were left upon the died in this instance which might have been saved to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, but are now probably in the hands of the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The captured artillery, as I have been informed, was successfully brought away, but of smaller arms the ground was strewn with them.--Transportation is not always at hand in an emergency of this kind, and if every man would, for the time being, bear a double burden, the result in the aggregate could not but be valuable to the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/> Our loss was probably greater in men on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, in officers on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>We have defeated and disorganized <num value="1">one</num> of the finest equipped, and what has been spoken of by the <rs>Northern</rs> press as an invincible division of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, numbering not less than <num value="35">thirty-five</num> or <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/> There is little or nothing to be written from this point concerning the late battle, of which you are not already aware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The distance from the battle field &mdash; some <measure n="23miles" type="distance">twenty-three miles</measure>--the fact that the army is scattered over several miles of country, and the tardiness with which details come in &mdash; I mean such interesting personal narratives concerning the movements of different regiments as give zest to a description, prevents the record of that complete history which it would otherwise be my pleasure to give. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> We occupy materially the same ground as on the day after the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>A portion of the battle- field is in possession of the enemy; a portion we still hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>The Federals are busy in reorganizing, and we, too, are rapidly strengthening our position, preparatory to another fight, which is likely to ensue within a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Reconnoitering parties in force occasionally come towards our lines, but the presence of <persName n="Morgan,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="default:Morgan,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> and <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> acts as a check, and nothing is either gained or lost. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> Our wounded &mdash; at least as many as can be safely moved &mdash; have been sent away, and <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> presents much the same aspect as before the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>I remarked in a preceding letter that most of our wounds were in the extremities, and many of our killed were shot in the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>This is accounted for by the fact that being a woody country, our troops frequently took shelter behind trees, <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> style, and thus protected the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Probably large numbers of limbs will yet have to be sacrificed to the surgeon's knife, because the necessary operation was not performed upon the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/> From <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="200">two hundred</num> of our wounded were left on the battle-ground, on account of the danger attending their removal, and were captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>A large number of wounded Federals being likewise in our hands, a correspondence on the subject has passed between <persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and it has been agreed that as soon as they recover they shall be exchanged man for man. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>A Nashville paper, on the contrary, states that the <rs>Federals</rs> have met with a great defeat, their loss in killed, wounded and missing being not less than <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The last is somewhere near the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Our loss in prisoners during the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> will probably not exceed <num value="400">four hundred</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/> Among the trophies exhibited here are several shields taken from the bodies of men and officers, in which they were enveloped from neck to hips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of these was an indentation made by a Minnie bullet <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of an inch deep, showing that the invention is a really effectual defence against shots striking the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The shield is so arranged that its weight is upon the shoulders, being adjusted there by iron bands, or suspenders, and is made of steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>The officer from whom the <num value="1">one</num> in question was taken was killed by a ball in the head. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Fully <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the men are dressed in Federal hats and overcoats; some of our officers carry <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> swords, and, altogether, we have gathered a very respectable equipment of arms, garments, and luxuries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/> In my last letter, I believed indicated that the entire <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> camp was burned, after being occupied by our Army <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. This is an error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Only a portion of it, unfortunately, was destroyed, and the remainder fell into the hands of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on Tuesday after the fight, our army having fallen back to a new line of operations. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>All our forces had been removed to the main land from the island, and here they were surrounded by the enemy and beamed in beyond the hope of escapes, except in individual cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>The surrender took place on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> notification of danger was the presence of a gunboat, which, in a daring manner, had run the gauntlet of the batteries during a storm on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. Then transports and troops were thrown through a canal that had been cut on the <rs>Missouri</rs> side, and merged into the <rs>Mississippi</rs> below the <rs type="place">Island</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Then tell our batteries, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, and finally the stronghold itself. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>Its position is a strong <num value="1">one</num>, and with a sufficiency of troops may be considered impregnable, but after the experience of the past it is folly to count upon anything as certain until it is proved so. We are living, therefore, upon that. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> The present appearance of <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName> reminds <num value="1">one</num> very friendly of the cities of refuge spoken of in the <rs>Old Testament Scriptures</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>From <unclear></unclear> of the frontier and seacoast of this State refugees are flocking to this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Already the hotels and private boarding-houses are crowded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/> Not having anticipated such an accession to their population, the resident citizens had not laid in such a supply of provisions as would be sufficient in order that all may have enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Thus eatables sell very high, and the prices have an upward tendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>But the country around is rich and fertile, and tobacco, which thus far has answered all purposes with the farmers, will give place to corn pork, peas, potatoes, and other articles more easily digested than the weed. </p> </div3>

<head>Brutality.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/> The moral brutality displayed in this war (says the <orgName n="New Orleans Delta" type="newspaper">New Orleans <hi rend="italics">Delta</hi></orgName>) by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> is in keeping with the physical brutality which the war has served to conspicuously develop in the same people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>It is impossible to civilize and refine a genuine specimen of the race by any amount of culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>You cannot convert <num value="1">one</num> of them into a chivalrous for man by giving him a sword, a uniform and spare, any more than you can change the nature of an ass by covering him with a <rs n="lion skin" type="product">lion's skin</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>You can no more transform <num value="1">one</num> of them into a Christian gentleman by teaching him theology and dressing him in the <unclear>cler oth, </unclear> than you can make a white man out of a negro by painting him white. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> A favorite form in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have displayed their moral brutality since the war began, has consisted in an impertinent, vulgar and <unclear> eeling</unclear> practice of lecturing the <rs>Confederate</rs> prisoners on the wickedness of <q>&#x0022;rebellion.&#x0022;</q> A hypocritical tone of pity generally <unclear> vates</unclear> the outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Crocodile tears are want to besmear the unfortunate men who recompiled to listen to didactic lessons on the duty of loyalty from men whom they loathes and despise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Next to the passion for grabbing commodities to which he has no fight, is the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee's</rs> burning desire to impart opinions which are not wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>He is pre-eminent alike <unclear></unclear> and for propagandism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Having <unclear> ed</unclear> you to poverty by the <num value="1">one</num>, he yearns <unclear> i </unclear> you to mental servility by the <unclear> </unclear> This marked his conduct towards the <rs>South</rs> before the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>He pilfered from his pockets with <num value="1">one</num> hand, and did his best <unclear> al</unclear> away our mental independence with <unclear></unclear> other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The war has changed his methods, but not his principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>He has substituted military robbery for financial and commercial robbery, and instead of the <name>Abolition</name> it capture upon which he formerly relied, he <unclear> s</unclear> to delivering lectures to helpless <unclear>pris </unclear> and to administering oaths to <unclear>intim</unclear> citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/> While <persName n="Wise,,O.,Jennings,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="default:Wise,O.,Jennings,,"><foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>Jennings</foreName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> was lying mortally wounded, a prisoner on <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, he was approached by a beastly Federal <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> who, instead of using his professional <unclear> </unclear> to soothe the agony of the dying man, embraced the occasion to sent the exultation of his brutal soul over the scene of Confederate disaster by predicting the speedy restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>His brutality was irreplaceable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The instincts of a Hottentot would have taught him more charity and gentleness in such a situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>But this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vulture must plunge his foul beak to the eyes in the mortal anguish of the fallen hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>He must, if possible, torture the mind of the dying <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, quivering on the verge of the last mystery, with cruel doubts of the success of the cause in which he considered it a happiness and glory to fall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> A like brutal display occurred in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> on the occasion of a sermon delivered to the <rs>Fort Donelson</rs> prisoners by a Federal chaplain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Such things are doubtless of daily occurrence, but this has accidental prominence from the fact that it was reported and extensively published shortly after the arrival of the prisoners in Federal territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The holy man observed that he did not appear before them to taunt them with their humiliating situation; he would overlook the folly and criminality which led to their misfortunes, he was there to testify the wondrous stretch of Gospel mercy which did not exclude even such wretches as they from its pale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The canting brute!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>We have given the substance, according to recollection, of the insulting exordium of his sermon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>It gives <unclear></unclear> a faint idea of the slimy, <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs>-like malignity which steeped the words actually employed by the hideous <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> effigy of a man of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> </div3>
