<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> The facts that <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,Jessie,Benton,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName> is at, if not west of, <placeName reg="Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri" key="tgn,7013811">Jefferson City</placeName>, the capital of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, which is but <placeName><distance reg="120miles">120 miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName></placeName>, now the rebel focus in that State--that the rebels mean to take <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri" key="tgn,7013811">Jefferson City</placeName>, preparatory to an attack on <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> &mdash; that <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> F., on the other hand, is strongly suspected of designs against <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> and its present possessors &mdash; all point to an early and serious collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The cautious, diplomatic, doubtless wise strategy of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> is not adapted to the <rs>West</rs>, where those who go to war are strongly suspected of a disposition to hurt somebody, and to look for the enemy with a decided intent to pitch in. We strongly hope not to hear of any fight there for some days yet, since the <rs>Union</rs> forces are widely scattered on almost every side of the rebels, and there is imminent danger that the latter may strike the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow <name>East</name> or <name>West</name> in overwhelming force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>We have no faith in the strategy which would <hi rend="italics">surround</hi> an army of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> with <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> independent <hi rend="italics">corps,</hi> separated by <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> march, and so liable to be attacked and beaten in succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Yet, presuming the rebel leaders to understand their business, it is hardly possible to avoid such attacks before effecting a concentration; while to protect <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> on the west, <placeName reg="Saint Joseph, Buchanan, Missouri" key="tgn,7014443">St. Joseph</placeName> and the line of the <orgName n="North Missouri Railroad" type="railroad">North Missouri Railroad</orgName> on the north, and <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jefferson City, Cole, Missouri" key="tgn,7013811">Jefferson City</placeName> on the east, might seem to preclude the necessary concentration at all. We judge, however, that the control of the <placeName reg="Missouri River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014086">Missouri river</placeName> and the railroad aforesaid are advantages to the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> which cannot fail to be improved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,Jessie,Benton,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName> is, with regard to military operations of magnitude, and untried commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>His fitness to lead <num value="1000">thousands</num> is now to be established or disproved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Success is the world's test of merit; and, should he now be beaten by the rebels, he will be judged a pretender and a charlatan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>He may have less than half so many men as he confronts &mdash; his may be the greenest recruits, while the enemy are comparative veterans, flushed with repeated triumphs &mdash; he may be crippled for want of arms and munitions, while the allies of <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName> before him may have stolen themselves rich in everything needed &mdash; no matter: he must triumph, or be whistled down the wind as unequal to his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>We presume he comprehends this hard necessity, and is prepared to wrestle with Fortune on such conditions as she sees fit to prescribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>He may be beaten &mdash; he may even prove incompetent to lead an army &mdash; but we sadly mistake the man if any bullets shall touch his back unless in the way of exit from his body. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> His raw troops may be scattered by an equal force, though we do not believe they will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Should the rebels await his attack at or near <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, they will of course avail themselves of every natural advantage of position, and will improve these by field-works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>They have never yet fought equal numbers on a fair field, and we do not think they ever will when there is any alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>And should he fail and fall, simply because he is compelled, like <persName n="Lyon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyon</surname></persName>, to fight an over-whelming force, we are sure his countrymen will not refuse him the tribute of a manly tear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> How many men he will be able to muster in front of <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, we do not know, but believe the number cannot fall short of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num>, and hope it will be swelled to <num value="40000">forty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>If he can but have arms and munitions, we shall hope for the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>We know, however, that he has at no moment been able to arm or equip the volunteers pressing to his standard &mdash; that he left, at <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, when he started up the river last <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, whole regiments for which he had no weapons, while a regiment of cavalry lately drew up before him with but a single saddle, and never a belt or scabbard &mdash; and that field-guns ordered by him, and deemed essential to his service, have lain for weeks, and still lie in this city, simply because some underling of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> does not see fit to accept and forward them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> Speaking of purchases reminds me of a recent visit to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, and the way I saw some soldiers swindled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>While waiting for the smith to tack a loose shoe upon my horse, fancy led me into <num value="1">one</num> of the bazaars that adorn the lively town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>It was a dark, filthy-looking room, and so low that <num value="1">one</num> involuntarily stooped to keep from bruising his head upon the blackened beams above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>An odor, hardly as agreeable as Patchouly, caused by a combination of old clothes, new boots, ginger cakes, and tobacco, pervaded the atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>A few soldiers were leaning over the counter, behind which the honest shopkeeper kept an eye upon the main chance by carefully gauging his prices according to the bulk of a customer's <q>&#x0022;pile.&#x0022;</q> On the shelves around were ranged the wares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Imagine <num value="1">one</num> of those shops in the outskirts of a city where you buy a shoe-string and half a nutmeg for <num value="1">one</num> cent, a pawnbroker's shop, a <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jewish</rs> <q>&#x0022;old clo's&#x0022;</q> store, and a cross-road grocery, all united in <num value="1">one</num>, and you have some idea of the place I am speaking of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Buttons, pins, needles, tobacco, paper and envelopes, and beside them russet shoes, bright yellow shirts, bright red cravats, <rs n="seal skin" type="product">seal-skin</rs> caps, and blue bandannas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The prices were variable, but all <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five hundred per cent.</num> above an immense profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Tobacco, <measure n="15cents" type="currency">15 cents</measure> per paper; and so on through a long list of worthless goods that had the dust of half a century upon them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> As I write, <num value="1">one</num> company of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, under <persName n="Garnett,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Garnett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Garnett</surname></persName>, is returning from target practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The appearance of any of this fine corps in our streets always attracts universal attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>In the distance the music of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">1st Virginia</orgName> band can be heard at the head of the regiment, which is on its way to brigade drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Their new uniforms were received to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> At this point, having ran entirely out of <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> facts, I am forced to say that <q>&#x0022;this is all.&#x0022;</q> Not to stop too suddenly, we will imagine the farce over; the green curtain descending, and as it unrolls the author steps before it; he advances towards the footlights; inserting <num value="1">one</num> hand in his rear pocket, the other between <num value="2">two</num> buttons of his vest, he bows with all the blandness of the amiable <persName n="Pickwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Pickwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pickwick</surname></persName>; he thanks the audience for their kind attention, and with innumerable bows retires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>But here the illusion ends; for fancy tells him there are no clapping of delicate hands, no shower of bouquets, no rows of sparkling eyes, to encourage him on to future effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>For the moment, like the mountebank, he dons the <q>&#x0022;cap and bells&#x0022;</q> and attracts attention; the next, both himself and his labor are forgotten.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/> We are glad to be enabled to state that the terms of a treaty between the <rs>Queen</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">the Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, and the <rs>Queen</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, are in the course of arrangement for an immediate intervention, by the combined forces of the <num value="3">three</num> Sovereigns, in the affairs of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>The old standing claims of the <rs>British</rs>, the <rs>French</rs>, and the <rs>Spanish</rs> people against the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Republic, have at last brought the long suffering of these <num value="3">three</num> Powers to an end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/> The manner in which the <num value="3">three</num> allied Powers intend to carry out their object is at once the most inexpensive and the most effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>They leave no intention whatever of wasting powder and shot by waging a territorial war upon <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>To land a military force and advance upon the capital is altogether out of their contemplation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>It would be impossible to deal with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> as an organized and established Government, with a recognized center of authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>The intention of the allies, on the contrary, is to send a combined naval force into the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>This force will blockade, and will, we apprehend, temporarily occupy the principal ports of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, such as <placeName reg="Veracruz, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005599">Vera Cruz</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName>, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>By these means the allies will, no doubt, bring the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government to an immediate acquiescence in their terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>But whether they bring them to terms, or whether they do not, will probably make very little difference in the attainment of their object; for what they will do by treaty, if they do bring the refractory Government to terms, they will do by force if they do not bring it to terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The plan on which they have agreed for the satisfaction of the outstanding claims is this: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/> The Allied Powers will sequestrate the custom revenue of the ports in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>They will change their Consuls, or some other authorities, jointly to collect these revenues at the different ports; and these Consuls, acting together, will form a sort of international commission, constituted for the purpose, at each port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>No ship will be able either to enter or clear at the ports of <placeName reg="Veracruz, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005599">Vera Cruz</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName>, &#x0026;c., without the authority of these Consuls, who will exact &mdash; and not only exact, but themselves receive &mdash; the custom dues on such entrances and clearances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>They will we presume, observe the existing customs duties recognized by <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> laws, and will throw the proceeds into a common treasury of their own at each port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>They then intend to retain a given proportion of these proceeds for their respective nations, and to pay over a portion to the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>We believe that the <name>Allies</name> will retain about <num value="0.5">fifty per cent</num>, of these, and will pay over <num value="0.5">fifty per cent</num>, to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>This is a liberal arrangement towards <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and it is <num value="1">one</num> which will reserve to that Government such a customs revenue as will enable it still to discharge the expenses of its own civil administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>But it is also an effectual arrangement for the <rs>Allied Powers</rs>, the customs revenue of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> being very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Their respective Consuls, after paying over to the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government its share of the proceeds, quarter by quarter, will divide the balance, or other half, rateably between the <num value="3">three</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>This arrangement will be permanent, or will endure at least until all claims shall have been discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>A ship of war or <num value="2">two</num> in the roadsteads of each of these ports will meanwhile secure the maintenance of the authority of the allied Consuls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> Much of this arrangement, of course, presumes the capitulation of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>But it, contrary to all probability, that Government should attempt to hold out, this (which would otherwise have been done by arrangement with the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> authorities) will be done by means of a blockade.--As soon as the arrangement can be made with the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government, there will no longer be need of an effective blockade, for the authority of the <name>Consuls</name> would spring from a treaty with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> herself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/> It is probable that the repayment of British and other claims under this just, though vigorous, measure will be rapid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>We observe that in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> the value of the exports of <placeName reg="Veracruz, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005599">Vera Cruz</placeName> alone was <num value="133000">133,000</num>,000f., or &#x00A3;<num value="6320000">6,320,000</num>.--We do not imagine that it will be necessary for ourselves to send any additional force into that quarter of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>We have already on the <rs n="West Indian" type="location">West Indian</rs> and <orgName n="American station" type="station"><persName n="North,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="mostcommon:North,nomatch:0"><surname>North</surname></persName> American station</orgName> <num value="26">twenty-six</num> vessels of war, mounting <num value="500">five hundred</num> guns, and carrying <num value="6000">six thousand</num> men. We believe, moreover, that the force which will appear in the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> will be such as to extort immediate compliance, and we shall hardly be too sanguine if we look forward to seeing the system of revenue collection which we have already explained brought into full and regular operation before the close of the present year. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/> The <name>French</name> army lay encamped only about a day's march from <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>It was <date value="10-23">on the 23d of October.</date> The sentinels were doubled and the most strict orders given, for the <name>Prussian</name> and <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> spies were plenty and troublesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>At <time value="12am">midnight</time>, <persName n="Sancoin,,Pierre,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="default:Sancoin,Pierre,,,"><foreName>Pierre</foreName> <surname>Sancoin</surname></persName> was stationed at <num value="1">one</num> of the outposts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>He was a stout, bold, shrewd man, and a good soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>The colonel of the regiment was with the sergeant on this'bout, having requested to be called at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, that he might visit the outposts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/> <q>&#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> he said, after the man had been posted, <q>&#x0022;you must keep your eyes open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Don't let even a stray horse go in or out without a pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Do you understand?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/> <q>&#x0022;Ay, mon, colonel, I shall be prompt.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/> <q>&#x0022;The dogs are around us,&#x0022;</q> continued the officer, <q>&#x0022;and you cannot be too careful.--Don't trust men, nor brutes, without good proof.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/> <q>&#x0022;Never fear, sir,&#x0022;</q> was <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName>'s answer, as he brought his firelock to his shoulder and moved back a pace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> After this they moved on to the next post, and <persName n="Sancoin,,Pierre,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00393" reg="default:Sancoin,Pierre,,,"><foreName>Pierre</foreName> <surname>Sancoin</surname></persName> was left alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/><placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName>'s post was <num value="1">one</num> of the most important in the camp, or rather around it, and he had been placed there for that reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>The ground over which he had to walk was a long knoll, bounded at <num value="1">one</num> end by a huge rock, and at the other sloping away into a narrow ravine, in which was a copse of willows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Beyond this copse the ground was low and boggy, so that a man could not pass it. The rock was to the westward, and <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName>'s walk was to its outer side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/> The night was quite dark, huge masses of clouds floating overhead, and shutting out the stars; and a sort of fog seemed to be rising almost from the marsh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>The winds moaned through the corpse in the ravine, and the air was damp and chilly; with a slow, steady tread, the soldier paced his ground, ever and anon stopping to listen, as the willows in the ravine rattled their leaves, or some night bird flew out with its quick flapping. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>An hour had passed away, and the sentinel had seen nothing to excite his suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>He had stopped for a moment close by the rock, when he was startled by a quick, wild screech from the woods; and in a moment more a large bird flew over his head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/> <q>&#x0022;Pablieu!&#x0022;</q> he uttered, after the night bird had flown over; <q>&#x0022;could mortal man have stopped that fellow from passing.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> He satisfied himself that he had done nothing in suffering the bird to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>He had walked the length of his way <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, when he was sure he saw a dark object just crossing the line toward the corpse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/> <q>&#x0022;Hold!&#x0022;</q> he cried, bringing the musket quick to his shoulder: <q>&#x0022;Hold or <num value="1">1</num> fire!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>And, with his piece at aim, he advanced towards the spot where the object had stopped; as he came to within a few yards of it, it started again toward the camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/> <q>&#x0022;Diable!&#x0022;</q> cried <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName>; <q>&#x0022;move any further and I fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>What, Pardieu?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/><foreign lang="fre"><persName n="Prince,,Le,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00394" reg="default:Prince,Le,,,"><foreName>Le</foreName> <surname>Prince</surname></persName>.</foreign> Ho!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>ho! why, <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/> The animal turned and made a motion as though he would leap up on to the sentinel's bosom, but he motioned him off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/> <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Bravo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00395" reg="mostcommon:Bravo,nomatch:0"><surname>Bravo</surname></persName>, <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>!&#x0022;</q> <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> cried, reaching forth his hand and patting the head of the shagg beast, which had now sat upon his haunches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/><placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> recognized the intruder now as a great dog, of the breed of <placeName reg="Saint Bernard, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2081723">St. Bernard</placeName>, which had been owned in the regiment for over a year, and which had now been missing for over week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>He had disappeared <num value="1">one</num> night from the pickets, and all search for him had been unavailing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/> <q>&#x0022;<foreign lang="fre">Parblieu!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>mon grand <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>!</foreign>&#x0022;</q> <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> uttered, as though the dog could understand every word, <q>&#x0022;the men will be glad to see you. Where have you been for so long?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/> The dog made no answer to this, save a low whine, and familiar nodding of the head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> <q>&#x0022;Now, <foreign lang="fre">mon ami,</foreign> you just keep your sitting there till the guard comes, and then we will go to the camp together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Mind that, will you?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>And with these words, uttered with solemn emphasis and due meaning, <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> started on his route again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>He had got half way to the rock, when the idea of looking around struck him, and he did so. <foreign lang="fre"><persName n="Prince,,Le,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00396" reg="default:Prince,Le,,,"><foreName>Le</foreName> <surname>Prince</surname></persName></foreign> was moving toward the camp again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/> <q>&#x0022;Ha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/><rs type="role2">Prince</rs>, that won't do. Stop, stop, or I'll shoot!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Diable! the colonel was positive in his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>I was to let nothing pass my post without the countersign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>A dog is something: you can't go, <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>, so now lie down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Down! Down! I say!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/> With this the dog lay flat down on his belly, and stretched out his fore paws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/><placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> patted him upon the head again, and, having duly urged upon him the necessity of remaining where he was, he resumed his march once more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> During the next <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> the animal lay perfectly quiet, and ever and anon the sentinel, by way of being sociable, would speak to him. But at length the dog made another attempt to go to the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/><placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> had nearly reached the rock, when he heard the movement, and, on turning, could just see his uneasy companion making off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/> <q>&#x0022;Diable!&#x0022;</q> the honest fellow uttered; <q>&#x0022;I must obey orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>The colonel's word was plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Here, Pablieu!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Come here!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Here, <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/><foreign lang="fre">Mon <persName n="Dieu,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00397" reg="mostcommon:Dieu,nomatch:0"><surname>Dieu</surname></persName>!</foreign> You must die if you don't.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/> With a few quick bounds the soldier had got near enough to the dog to fire, and as the latter stopped he stopped. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/> <q>&#x0022;<foreign lang="fre">Mon cher ami,</foreign> you must stay with me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>Come back!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>I must shoot if you don't. Parblieu!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>what a thing to start a whole camp for, to shoot a dog.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/> But, by coaxing and threatening, the sentinel got the dog back to his post, and there he made him lie down once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>And thus matters rested till the tramp of the coming guard was heard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/> <q>&#x0022;Ah, now, <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>, he'll be relieved,&#x0022;</q> the soldier said, stopping near the dog. <q>&#x0022;You shall go and see your old friends.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/> The tramp of the coming guards drew near, and <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName> was preparing to hail them when the dog took a new start, and in a new direction, this time starting towards the copse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/> <q>&#x0022;Here, here, <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Parblieu, don't you run off again.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> But the dog took no other notice of the call than to quicken his speed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/> <q>&#x0022;Back!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>back! here!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/> <q>&#x0022;Grand <persName n="Dieu,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00398" reg="mostcommon:Dieu,nomatch:0"><surname>Dieu</surname></persName>!&#x0022;</q> This last expression was forced from Fierre's lips, by seeing the dog leap to his hind legs and run thus!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>In an instant the truth burst upon him. Quick as thought he clapped his gun to his shoulder and took aim. He could just distinguish the outlines now, and then he fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>There was a sharp cry, and <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName> had to turn, for the guards were approaching. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/> <foreign lang="fre"> <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Qui,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00399" reg="mostcommon:Qui,nomatch:0"><surname>Qui</surname></persName> est la?&#x0022;</q> </foreign> (<q>&#x0022;Who is there?&#x0022;</q>) He cried. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/> <q>&#x0022;Relief guard,&#x0022;</q> was the answer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>And having obtained the countersign, he informed the officer of what had happened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/> <q>&#x0022;A dog?&#x0022;</q> cried the officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/><q>&#x0022;<rs type="role2">Prince</rs>, did you say?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/> <q>&#x0022;He looked like <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>, but, Diable, you should have seen him run off on his legs!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> <q>&#x0022;Eh?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>hind legs!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/> <q>&#x0022;Yes.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/> <q>&#x0022;Then come; show us where he was.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/> With this the officer of the mounted guard pulled his lantern from his breast, and having removed the shade, he started on. <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> led the way to the copse, and there the dog was found in the last struggles of death.--The officer stooped down and turned him over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/> <q>&#x0022;<foreign lang="fre">Grand <persName n="Dieu,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00400" reg="mostcommon:Dieu,nomatch:0"><surname>Dieu</surname></persName>!</foreign>&#x0022;</q> he cried; <q>&#x0022;what legs for a dog, oh!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>And no wonder he said so. The hind legs of the dog were booted, and had every appearance of the pedal extremities of the genius man. But all doubts were removed very quickly, for as the officer turned, the words <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> take me!&#x0022;</q> in the <name>Prussian</name> tongue, followed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/> <q>&#x0022;Diable!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>here's an adventure!&#x0022;</q> uttered the officer, and he made <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName> hold the lantern while he ripped open enough of the dog's skin to find the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>But they concluded not to stop there to investigate; so they formed a litter by crossing their muskets, and, having lifted the strange animal upon it, they proceeded on their way. When they reached the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> camp <unclear/> they found half the soldiers up, waiting to find out why the gun was fired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/> Lights were brought, and the body placed upon the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>The dog's skin was removed and within was found a Prussian drummer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>He was a small fellow, though apparently some <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of age, but he was dead &mdash; <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName>'s ball having touched his heart, or somewhere very near it. His pockets were overhauled, and in <num value="1">one</num> of them was found a cipher but no <num value="1">one</num> of them could make anything out of it. The colonel took it, and directed that the body he placed out of sight for burial on the morrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/> But this was not the end. About <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, just before daylight, another gun was fired on the same post where <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName> had been; and this time a man was shot who was trying to make his escape from camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>He was shot through the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>When the body was brought into camp, it was found to be that of a Bavarian trooper, who had been suspected of treachery, though no proof had ever been found against him. On his person was found the key to the cipher which had been taken from the person of the drummer; and now that the colonel had them both, he could translate the mystic scroll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>It proved to be a direction to the <name>Bavarian</name> to lay his plans for keeping as near <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s person as possible, after he should enter <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, and then wait for further orders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/> The mystery was explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>The <rs>Bavarian</rs> had contrived to call the great dog away from the regiment, and deliver him up to the enemy, and his skin was to be made the cover for a spy to enter the camp, and the spy would have got in, too, but for the sportive order of the colonel, and the willfully faithful obedience of <persName n="Sancoin,,Pierre,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00401" reg="default:Sancoin,Pierre,,,"><foreName>Pierre</foreName> <surname>Sancoin</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/> On the next day <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName> was promoted to the rank of sergeant, and the <rs>Emperor</rs> said to him, as he bestowed the boon: <q>&#x0022;If you only make as faithful an officer as you have proved yourself faithful as a sentinel, I ask no more.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
