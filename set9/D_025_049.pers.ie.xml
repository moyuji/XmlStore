<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> this morning the communication alluded to above was returned to these headquarters, bearing your recognized official signature, and it can now be noticed as your deliberate official act. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> Among nations not barbarous, the usages of war prescribe that when a city is about to be attacked timely notice shall be given by the attacking commander, in order that non-combatants may have an opportunity for withdrawing beyond its limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> Since you have felt warranted in inaugurating this method of reducing batteries in your immediate front which were found otherwise impregnable, and a mode of warfare which I confidently declare to be atrocious and unworthy of any soldier, I now solemnly warn you that if you fire again on this city from your <placeName reg="Morris Island batteries">Morris Island batteries</placeName>, without granting a somewhat more reasonable time to remove non-combatants, I shall feel impelled to employ such stringent means of retaliation as may be available, during the continuance of this attack. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>He advocated its adoption by the <name>Council</name> on the ground that the building objected to by the petitioners was a very large wooden stable, and its completion and occupancy would greatly endanger the safety of property surrounding it. He read the <orgName type="regiment" key="35Section">35th section</orgName> of the <rs>Charter</rs> of the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to show that <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the property-holders in any <num value="1">one</num> square in the city had the right to protest against the erection of any house built of wood which, in their opinion, might depreciate the value of their property, and appealed to the members present to grant the prohibition asked for by the petitioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The petition, he contended, had been properly gotten up, and the subject was <num value="1">one</num> in which the welfare of a respectable portion of the city was concerned. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>He contended that, even if the stable objected to had just been commenced, the petition could not prevent its completion, as <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the property-holders had <hi rend="italics">not</hi> signed it. <persName n="Taylor,Mister,James,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="default:Taylor,James,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName n="James">Jas.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> being simply an agent for the owners of a large portion of the property said to be endangered, had no right, under the charter, to sign such an instrument of the kind presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The reading of said charter expressly defines that none but the owner shall protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The building was now nearly finished, and therefore it was not in the power of any objectors to interfere with it, as the law only referred to those which had not been commenced, and could not affect <num value="1">one</num> which had already been put up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Instead of the building which was objected to being a small <num value="1">one</num>, it had a front of at least <measure n="30feet" type="distance">30 feet</measure>, and a depth of <measure n="50feet" type="distance">50 feet</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He contended that the argument used by <persName n="Nance,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Nance,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Nance</surname></persName>, that because the building complained of was nearly finished it was not in the province of the <name>Council</name> to have it removed, was inadmissible &mdash; a house was not a house till it was finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He (<persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="nearbymention:Scott,William,,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>) thought the ordinance defective, inasmuch as it only provided for protests from persons residing on the same square where objectionable building were about being put up, whereas often times property across the street was in more danger than that on the same side of the street in case of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It was singular the city had never pursued more stringent measures to suppress these grievous nuisances. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>He recollected some years since, when fires were so frequent in this city that the <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">Fire Department</orgName> positively refused to insure a great many houses which were located in the neighborhood of stables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The further completion of the building complained of in the petition should, in his opinion, be interdicted by the <name>Council</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>A large number of the houses in the square on which the stable of <persName n="Boisseau,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Boisseau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Boisseau</surname></persName> was being erected was of wooden structure, and of the most combustible character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The property was located on the square embracing <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> and <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> and <address><street n="Franklin street">Franklin</street></address> and <address><street n="Grace street">Grace streets</street></address>, where in all directions were many stables, and old, inflammable shanties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He still maintained that complaint should have been made before the erection of the building was commenced.

<p> <hi rend="smallcaps">The Demonstrations</hi> of opposition to the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> in the <rs>Northern States</rs> are of a character appropriate to that country, and do not promise much success to those who are engaged in the agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>There are too many parties to it, and they are too much divided in their counsels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The only point they are united upon is that of &#x0022;crushing the rebellion,&#x0022; and in uniting upon that they throw all the power in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The common people instinctively ask, &#x0022;If you all agree with the <rs>Government</rs> that the rebellion must be crushed, why do you oppose the <rs>Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Why not give it men and money to do what it is so earnestly striving to do?&#x0022; The answer is most difficult, and can hardly satisfy the masses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> We doubt not that a large portion of those in the opposition are playing their cards cunningly &mdash; that they are really anxious to stop the war; but knowing that an unconditional opposition to it would be so unpopular that they could not successfully maintain it, they make the suppression of the rebellion <num value="1">one</num> of the planks in their platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>This kind of political fraud is characteristic of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It belongs to the genius of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They had stamped it upon the national platforms of the great parties for years before the breaking up of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>It had corrupted Southern statesmen and was insinuating its bad influences through the land like a plague But the cunning gamblers are playing their game against powerful odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>They are &#x0022;fighting the tiger.&#x0022; <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is behind the table, and has all the advantages of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>He has the treasury and the army, the purse and the sword, and they nothing but cunning words and hypocritical pretences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>His cartridges and balls, his chains and prisons, are powerful arguments against their war of words, and to offset their intrigue and management he has the entire patronage and contracts of the <rs>Government</rs>, so immensely swollen by the war, sufficient to bribe the controlling men of the entire nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The odds are incalculably heavy against the opposition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> There is a part of the people and prominent men of the <rs>North</rs> who have declared unconditionally for the termination of the war. But they are few who have been bold enough to do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The <placeName reg="Woods, Hamilton, New York" key="tgn,2781720">Woods, in New York</placeName>, and <persName n="Rynders,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Rynders,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Rynders</surname></persName>, were the leaders of those in New York who took this ground, and it was observable that at the meeting which took this stand none of the more prominent statesmen made their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They fought shy, and preferred to indulge in generalities about the restoration of peace by terminating the rebellion in some way. They would have preferred trick and cheating, with some bribery, doubtless; but it was left to be inferred that either these arts and appliances or force must be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Even <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName>, whom we do not impugn along with the common run of Northern politicians, has not been consistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>In Congress he refused to vote a dollar for the war, but still he has declared himself for a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> either by negotiation or <hi rend="italics">war.</hi> If he could not succeed by peaceable means he has said that he would employ arms, and would himself enter the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>While we doubt whether he would, if he controlled matters, make a very <hi rend="italics">vigorous war,</hi> nevertheless the moral weight of his position is against what all of them call the &#x0022;rebellion,&#x0022; and therefore in favor of war and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who is carrying it on! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> Looking over the field of Northern politics then, we see not how headway is likely to be made against the <rs>Washington</rs> despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Important elections are soon to take place which will throw much light upon the tone and temper of Northern popular feeling, especially in the <rs>Northwest</rs>, and how they have been influenced by the inconsistent and confused opposition raised against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>We question very much whether he fears it at all. His bold measures for putting an end to &#x0022;free speech and free press,&#x0022; not having been resisted, he no doubt feels that he is firmly seated in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>He will hardly have to call out his janizaries to stifle the voice of the people at the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The timidity of the leaders of the opposition, their vehement declarations about the putting down the rebellion show the popular sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>They know the servile masses of the <rs>North</rs> and are trying to propitiate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They will be defeated if there is any truth in the signs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>That the serried ranks of black Republicanism, backed by the army and power and patronage of the <rs>Government</rs>, will prevail against their divided legions, we think more than probable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> There is no good reason in an opinion to calculate upon any speedy divisions among the <rs>Northern</rs> people of an extent sufficient to be very beneficial to us.--For the natural effects of the disturbing causes which must disrupt society and separate the populations of the <rs>North</rs>, time is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Even with time, they must be assisted by our own courage and constancy.
