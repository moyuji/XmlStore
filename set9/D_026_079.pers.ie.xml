<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Closing the wound with a large compress and bandage, opinion and stimulants were freely administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Reaction took place, and in a fortnight sufficient adhesions were established to permit exposure of the cavity of the wound and to recognize and remove the metal face of the watch from some <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> at the bottom of the wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>For several weeks fragments of the watch continued to present themselves and were extracted; some from upon the diaphragm, others below the clavicle.--The lung collapsing, was not torn to pieces, though wounded in several points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Both the heart, covered by the pericardium, and the north were exposed to view and to touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Suppuration was enormous; hemorrhages frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The collapsed lung became bound down by adhesions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The whole side of the thorax sank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Sustained by every article of nutritious food calculated to supply an inordinate appetite, the patient's recovery was slow, until the wound, progressively reduced, could only admit a catheter.

<head>Duration of the war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> We like the grim humor of those soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who have enlisted &#x0022;for this war and <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the next.&#x0022; The spirit that expresses itself thus is the spirit which should animate every citizen as well as every soldier of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It recognizes the war as by possibility <num value="1">one</num> of the permanent institutions of society, and as such accepts it with unflinching nerves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>To the question, &#x0022;How long will the war last?&#x0022; it has but <num value="1">one</num> answer to give, and that is, &#x0022;It will last till we are free.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> We have no other answer that can be given to the question &mdash; none, at any rate, that free men should deign to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The soldiers of our army have no other reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>They no longer manifest that natural restlessness in a condition of war which is engendered by a lifetime of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>War has become with them a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They have been forced by the wild beasts of the <rs>North</rs> to live the insecure and combatant life which men lead who live among wild beasts, until, like other hunters, the excitement and peril have become necessary to their happiness, and they are all might <persName><foreName>Nimrod</foreName></persName>, eager for the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> imagine that their perseverance in seeking to deprive as of home and existence is greater than our determination to kill them as often and as long as they come in our way, we have only to refer them to the resolve of our army to <unclear></unclear> enlist for this war and <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the next.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> It is more than a joke, this &#x0022;<measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the next.&#x0022; It shows not only a contentment with the war, but a determination to prolong it forever rather than yield to the robbers and murderers by whom we are assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It indicates a preference of war, with all its hardships and horrors, to peace with the house burning and assassinating nation which so long before this war has been lying like a <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs> coiled up in our chimney corner, only waiting an opportunity to strike his poisoned fangs into our heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Our only apprehension is that war will at last become to be the happiness of our soldiers, so that when the war is ended they will be taking <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> more out of somebody by way of keeping their hand in. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> Let the people learn a lesson from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Let them cease to disturb themselves upon the problem, &#x0022;How long the war will last?&#x0022; The agitation of such a question gives hope and encouragement to the flagging energies of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>It leads them to cherish the delusion that we will soon become so tired of the existing state of things as to be ready to accept peace on any terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Let us, therefore, show no unworthy anxiety on such a point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Let us learn to contemplate the possibility that the war will last till we and our children have passed from the scene of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>A state of perpetual war is as much to be preferred to the peace of submission to Yankeedom as the life of brave mariners on the storm to the ocean to the condition of frogs and tadpole in the midst of a miasanatie pool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Series to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and herding with <num value="1">one</num> own liberty slaves &mdash; that is the only peace to which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> destines us. &#x0022;How long will the war last?&#x0022; Let is last forever, if forever is necessary to keep us from such a fate as that. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> We have often wondered it, it were possible for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> depravity to sink to any lower depth than it had already exhibited in the present war. But if we were ever in credulous of such a possibility, we did great injustice to the boundless capacities of fanaticism for self- degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> The New York correspondent of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> reveals to the civilized would the tale of horror. &#x0022;It has been discovered,&#x0022; he says, &#x0022;by the advanced spirits of the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName> that the negro is in many important respects the superior of the whites, and that if the latter do not forget their pride of race and blood and color, and <unclear></unclear> with the purer and richer blood of the blacks, they will die out of <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>, and wither away in unproline skinniness, meriting by their obstinacy and tally the late of the red man, whom they have either exterminated or driven into the wilderness.--These are not mere assertions of the intelligent correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Times.</hi> Be mentions <persName n="Tilton,Reverend,Theodore,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="default:Tilton,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Tilton</surname></persName>, the condition of <persName n="Beecher,,H.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="default:Beecher,H.,W.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName> in the editorship of the <hi rend="italics">Independent,</hi> who a few years ago declared, in an assemblage principally composed of women, that it was good for while wanted to marry black men, and that the &#x0022;passional&#x0022; and &#x0022;emotional&#x0022; nature of the blacks was needed to improve the white raced &mdash; <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> has often hinted the same thing, and the doctrine once broached has found believers and <unclear></unclear>. A trant has recently been published and extensively calculated, from which the correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Tones</hi> gives copious extracts, maintaining the same hideous ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The writer declares that all that is necessary to make the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> (<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>) race the &#x0022;finest race on earth is to engraft upon our stock the negro element which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has placed by our side upon this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Of all the rich treasures of blood vouchsafed to us that of the negro is the most precious, because it is the most unlike any other that enters into the composition of our natural life.&#x0022; Then follows a succession of obscenities too indecent for publication, winding up with a conclusion black enough for his own lost soul. &#x0022;It will be a sad misfortune,&#x0022; he says, &#x0022;if this war should end without a black General in command of a white or mixed body of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We want an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Toussain L'Overture (the <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> chief) to give the black his proper position on this continent, <hi rend="italics">and the day is coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The South will fight to the last;</hi> but it is the <hi rend="italics">eternal fitness of things that they should finally be subdued by the black soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>After that, the lands of the <rs>South</rs> must be divided among the negroes, who are its only loyal population.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> Such are the sentiments, continues the correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> which elicit the approval of crowded audiences of educated <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, (<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>,) of whom a large preponderance were white women!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Have not these people nearly filled up the measure of their crimes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Was there over anything in the <rs>French Revolution</rs> as loathsome as these abominations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They seem to have been given up to the devils of uncleanness and cruelty to work their complete will upon.--If the prolongation of the war has no other benefit, it will at least reveal to mankind and to our own people what kind of creatures we were so long in league with, and demonstrate that perpetual war is a small evil in comparison with submission to such demons in human form. </p> </div3>
