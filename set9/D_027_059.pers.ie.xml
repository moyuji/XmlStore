<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> &#x0022;In the first place, <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> were offered in New York to &#x0027;anybody bringing in a recruit.&#x0027; The object of this was to interest somebody in doing the indispensable work of canvassing, of hunting up those who were likely to join the army, and in persuading them to join.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>This work has to be done by somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, it is done by officers and non-commissioned officers, specially detailed for this service, and directed (see the late circular of the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>) to frequent fairs, markets, and all other places resorted to by idle or adventurous or needy men; and in spite of their exertions, it is found no easy matter to keep the <rs>British</rs> army, small as it is, up to the required strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Suppose it were suddenly raised to <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men, and that gaps of tremendous size were being daily made in it by the casualties and disease of a bloody war, do you suppose the regular recruiting service would be the only agency to which the <rs>Government</rs> would resort to keep its ranks full?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Do you imagine that it would be saved the necessity of canvassing altogether by the spontaneous rush into the service, as private soldiers, of the &#x0027;genteel&#x0027; people, who are now filled with such horror because the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> make no scruple about employing mercenaries! </p> </q><bibl n="The New York correspondent"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> &#x0022;The brokers here, however, not only pocket the &#x0027;hand money&#x0027; for bringing the recruit, but they, in general, manage to share the bounty also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>That they should be able to do so is a striking illustration of the simplicity of the mass of those whom they enlist; but they do so to such an extent that more than <num value="1">one</num> of them in this city have made large fortunes by the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>They hunt up the recruits all over the country explain to them what may be had <unclear></unclear> them <unclear></unclear> to bring them to the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs>'s office</orgName>, show them the proper office to apply to, and, in fact, make use of the <num value="1000">thousand</num> advantages which a shrewd, city-bred knave generally possesses over country bumpkins, and especially &#x0022;raw <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs>,&#x0022; to enable them to get hold of a large share of the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I have heard of cases in which, out of <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>, the broker pocketed <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>; and I think there were few men enlisted through the instrumentality of the brokers in this city in which the recruit managed to retain over <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> or <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">$400</measure>. You will see from this that when men are called for by the <num value="200000">200,000</num> or <num value="300000">300,000</num> the profits of the business must be enormous.
