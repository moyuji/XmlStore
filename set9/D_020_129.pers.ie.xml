<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi> I wish to draw public attention to the situation of the <num value="22" type="ordinal">Twenty-Second</num> (late <persName n="Tompkins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Tompkins,nomatch:0"><surname>Tompkins</surname></persName>'s) Regiment <orgName type="mil" key="VAVolunteer">Virginia Volunteers</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This force is composed of the troops that were raised in the <rs type="place">Kanawha Valley</rs> at the commencement of hostilities, who have been in active service ever since, and now, after a campaign of unsurpassed hardship, suffering, and gallantry, were recently stationed with the command of <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> on <placeName reg="Cotton Mountain, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2258473">Cotton Mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>From that bleak summit they looked down on the encampment of the invaders who have seized on their country, and still hold the fairest region of the <name>Confederation</name> in bondage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Let us remember that the men of this regiment are <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, who have gained victories, endured privations, and braved the worst difficulties of a soldier's life for the common cause; and yet are as much strangers now on the soil of the <rs>State</rs> as the poor exiles of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> It is generally known that the <rs type="place">Valley of the Kanawha</rs> is cut off in a manner from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> by reason of geographical position, and lies distant from it by the whole breadth of all its mountain ranges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On this account the trade of all its business interests were formerly with the people of the <rs type="place">Ohio Valley</rs>, now turned to deadly enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This trade was once carried on through the <placeName reg="Ohio River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014265">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 2" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha rivers</placeName>, but when the war broke out the navigation of these streams gave easy access to their invaders, while the <rs>State</rs> could lend but little assistance to the brave and unfortunate <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> of the <rs type="place">Kanawha Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Yet, soon as hostilities began, they were among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to fly to arms, and expose themselves to the vengeance of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It was late in the month of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> before the authorities at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> sent <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> to their assistance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The results of his <sic>expedion</sic> are well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName> made head against the enemy till <persName n="Garnett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Garnett,nomatch:0"><surname>Garnett</surname></persName>'s defeat at <placeName reg="Rich Mountain, Randolph, West Virginia" key="tgn,2616904">Rich Mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But this disaster to our arms left <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> undefended, and set free the innumerable hordes of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to turn their arms against <orgName n="command"><persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, to intercept his communication with the <rs>East</rs>, and, by surrounding, to capture or destroy him. <persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName> was recalled at once, and by making good his retreat saved his command, to which the <rs>Kanawha</rs> troops were attached. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> It has been about <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> since these things happened, though the country has passed through so many trials, it seems to us as many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But the events of that time can never be forgotten by the <rs>Kanawha</rs>.--They had just triumphed over their enemies at Scarey <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Constituting the advance of <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s forces, about <num value="600">six hundred</num> <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName> men had met <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> troops, defeated, and utterly routed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>A large number of the invaders had been killed, wounded, and made prisoners; and more superior officers taken, I believe, than anywhere except at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>; and not even <hi rend="italics">that,</hi> when all things are considered, was a more intrepid defence, or more decided victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>True, this was <num value="1">one</num> of the minor combats of the war, but nowhere has there been a more gallant fight than that on the <name>Scarey</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Just then, news of the <rs type="place">Rich Mountain</rs> disaster reached <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>At a few hours' notice, its brave defenders were summoned to commence a retreat, and forced to leave home, family, and all they had, to the enemy, who have held possession of their country ever since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> It will also be remembered that, soon as the <rs>Government</rs> could rally from the discouragement of <persName n="Garnett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Garnett,nomatch:0"><surname>Garnett</surname></persName>'s defeat, <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> was sent to the relief of the <rs type="place">Kanawha counties</rs>; and the troops of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, placed under his command, marched back to meet their invaders again; but new disappointments awaited them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They fought again at <placeName key="tgn,2117925" n="1.000 4" reg="cross lanes, kanawha, west virginia">Cross Lanes</placeName> and <placeName reg="Carnifax Ferry">Carnifax Ferry</placeName> on the <name>Ganley</name>; shared in the triumphs of those well-contested fields, but again gathered nothing but barren laurels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> They have now advanced <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time against their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We have heard something of the autumnal storms on <placeName key="tgn,2653751" n="1.000 2" reg="sewell mountain, fayette, west virginia">Sewell Mountain</placeName>, the privations and sufferings of the troops there, the crossing by <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName>'s men of the <placeName reg="New River, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,1125392">New river</placeName> and their terrible march over the mountains of <placeName reg="Fayette, Howard, Missouri" key="tgn,2058748">Fayette</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The last news is that at least half the command are in the hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But I ask particular consideration for the <rs>Kanawha</rs> regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Its present condition is better known to others than myself; but we may imagine their state of destitution and suffering, when we remember that they have been constantly marching and fighting for <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> past; that they are cut off from friends and kindred; that driven from their homes, they know not the cares of sister, or wife, or mother, and that even now, it is said, the property they left for support of their families, lies under decrees of confiscation to the <rs>Pierpont Government</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The Department does all it can, no doubt; but it is very difficult for succor from that quarter, to meet privations such as theirs.--The aid our generous people have lavished on their brave defenders, has heretofore been bestowed on objects nearer home and better known; and not even the acknowledgment due their courage and constancy has yet reached the remote and obscure quarters of the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> P. S.--As my knowledge of the <rs type="place">Kanawha Valley</rs> troops, and of the counties bordering on it, was acquired early in the summer, it may be that some of them belong to other regiments than the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Wherever they are, they merit more than I have said of them. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> It is our duty, therefore, to devote all our energies to a vigorous prosecution of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> For this struggle, so suddenly commenced, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had for some time been making such preparations as her means enabled her to make; and although she was not so well prepared as was desirable, still she was better prepared than most of her Southern sisters.-- better perhaps than any <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>For some time anterior to the secession she had been engaged in the purchase of arms of different kinds, ammunition, and other necessary articles, and in mounting artillery, in anticipation of the event which subsequently occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> A large portion of the ammunition which has been used in the war, was captured at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, and the heavy guns supplied to our Southern sister States for coast, river and land defence, were captured with the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>How small a circumstance controls the greatest events!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>What embarrassments would have attended our operations in this important struggle, if these pieces had not been in our possession and ready for transportation to the field. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>As far back as the <date value="01-08">8th of January</date> last; I consulted with a gentleman whose position enabled him to know the strength of that Fortress, and whose experience in military matters enabled him to form an opinion as to the number of men that would be required to capture it. He represented it to be <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest fortifications in the world, and expressed his doubts whether it could be taken, unless assailed by water as well as by land, and simultaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>He stated emphatically and distinctly, that with the force then in the fortress, it would be useless to attempt its capture without a large force thoroughly equipped and well appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>At no time previous to the secession of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had we a military organization sufficient to justify an attempt to take it; and events since that occurrence demonstrate very clearly that with our military organization since, and now existing, it has not been deemed prudent to make the attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> Prior to the secession of the <rs>State</rs>, indeed from the commencement of my gubernatorial term, I used all proper means within my reach, aided and supported by the <orgName n="Military Commission" type="commission">military commission</orgName>, to prepare the <rs>State</rs> for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> communication which I had the honor to present to the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>, I used this language: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> <q>&#x0022;Whether the <rs>Union</rs> shall survive or perish, it is, nevertheless, your duty to place the <rs>State</rs> in such a condition that she will be prepared at all times, and upon the shortest notice, to protect her honor, defend her rights, and maintain her institutions against all assaults of her enemies With this view, I recommend a careful revision of the militia laws; and in this connection I suggest that munitions of war be procured and provision made for the organization of an efficient military staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>It would be well also to specify in the law the number of aids to which the <rs>Governor</rs> is entitled, and designate their rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>I cordially approve the bill herewith sent for the organization of a brigade of minute men, prepared by a gentleman remarkable for his intelligence, military knowledge and experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>And finally I commend the <orgName n="Virginia Military Institute" type="institute">Virginia Military Institute</orgName> to your favorable consideration, and urge that liberal appropriations be made for enlarging the buildings, and extending the sphere of its usefulness. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> In answer to this recommendation, the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> appropriated <measure n="180000dollars" type="currency">one hundred and eighty thousand dollars</measure>, <hi rend="italics">in bonds,</hi> to be expended in the purchase of arms, equipments, and munitions of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>At the time we made the purchase of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> muskets from the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, we desired to purchase <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> additional, but the authorities declined to sell them to us, although <num value="5">five</num> times the number were then in the arsenal at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> The appropriations for the purchase of arms were made, as before stated, <hi rend="italics">in bonds,</hi> all of which, under the law of the <rs>State</rs>, had to be negotiated <hi rend="italics">at par,</hi> before a dollar could be realized for purchases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>This was a source of serious embarrassment, and nothing but the untiring zeal and indomitable energy of the <orgName n="Military Commission" type="commission">military commission</orgName> enabled us to overcome the difficulties, and to make many purchases which proved of immense value in the struggle in which we have been and are now engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>It demonstrates her performance of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>She has been true to herself, to her ancient fame, and to her sisters of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> With full knowledge when she passed her ordinance of Secession, that her own soil was to be the battle field between the contending parties, that she in taking her position placed herself between the enemy and her Southern sisters, and would receive the blows that might otherwise fall upon them, she yet boldly occupied the position, stepped forward and received the shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>How gallantly her sons have maintained that position, history will attest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Her patriotism, her devotion to the common cause, will be fully recognized and admitted by all. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>When the war commenced, we were compelled to put our artillery companies in the field as fast as they could be raised and armed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The necessity which required the adoption of this course at the origin of this war, has continued to exist, and I have felt it to be a duty to transfer the companies to Confederate control as soon as they were mustered into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>It is not probable, therefore, that additional artillery regiments will be organized at this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> By agreement with the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> paid off her volunteers in the field to the <date value="06-30">30th day of June.</date> The <rs type="role" reg="Paymaster-General">Paymaster General</rs>'s report shows, that he has paid <num value="78">seventy eight</num> companies of cavalry, <num value="52">fifty-two</num> companies of artillery, <num value="402">four hundred and two</num> companies of infantry, <num value="1">one</num> company of cadets, and <num value="7">seven</num> companies of militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> The alacrity and promptitude with which our volunteers and militia have responded to the call of the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> Some legislation is necessary for filling the places of our volunteer forces now in the field when their present term of service shall expire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/> I refer with mortification and regret to the unpatriotic spirit which has been exhibited by a portion of our people in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and to the disloyal and revolutionary acts to which they have resorted to dismember this Common wealth, and to organize a new State within its limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Their conduct is without justification or excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The professions and pledges of the leading public men of that section, often repeated before, at the time, and subsequent to the passage of the <name>Ordinance</name> of Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>induced the belief that they would abide by the expressed will of a majority, as it might be exhibited at the polis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>That will, fairly expressed, was overwhelmingly in favor of the ordinance; and every obligation of patriotism, every consideration of duty and of lovely, the ties of kindred and association, should have induced them to abide by and acquiesce in this popular expression of sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>While claiming the common name of <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, they have sought to place their brethren, under the subjection of a tyrant and despot, who, in utter disregard of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and laws passed in pursuance thereof, has invaded the territory of their native State, by a hired soldiery, composed of the reckless and the abandoned, the dissolute and depraved, gathered from the purlieus of the cities and villages of the <rs>North</rs>, and the floating scum of western population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The personnel of their army is a living libel on mankind &mdash; Abandoning their own brethren, they have given aid and support to these mercenaries, and have justified them in shedding the blood of <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> upon their own soil.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> A day of retribution will assuredly come, and with it its certain attendants of shame and sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The enemies of our rights and our peace will be driven from that fertile and valuable portion of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> back to their homes in the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>West</rs>; and those who have counseled and abetted them will be made to feel that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, has power to execute her laws, and visit punishment upon the guilty violators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>They enjoy, as they should the sympathy of their loyal brethren; and I trust the time draws night when the measures which have been set on foot by the <rs>President</rs> will relieve the country from the tread of the invader, and restore them to their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The military movements for the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> and Northwest are in charge of an officer (a native of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>) of tried courage and experience, whose skill, ability and merit have sustained the severest tests in this and in the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>We must restore these men to their homes; we must repossess this country, and bring it again under subjection to the laws of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The Common wealth must not be dismembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/></l><l>And the whistling whistling ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/></l><l>And the never, never still; </l><l>Of the little leaflets failing, </l><l>With the sweetest saddest sound-- </l><l>And the soldier &mdash; oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>the soldier-- </l><l>In his blanket on the ground!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/></l> </lg> <lg type="stanza"> <l>Thus I lingered in my dreaming, </l><l>In my dreaming far away, </l><l>Till the spirit's picture painting </l><l>Seemed at visit at the day; </l><l>And the moonlight faded shortly </l><l>From the window opened wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/></l><l>And the faithful, faithful pointer </l><l>Nestled closer by my side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/></l> </lg> <lg type="stanza"> <l>And I knew that neath the starlight, </l><l>Tho' the chilly frost a may fall, </l><l>That the soldier will be dreaming, </l><l>Dreaming often of us all. </l><l>So I gave my spirit's painting </l><l>Just the breathing of a sound-- </l><l>For the dreaming, dreaming soldier, </l><l>In his slumber on the ground!
