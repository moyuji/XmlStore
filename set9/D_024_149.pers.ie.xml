<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> It is impossible to over-estimate the value of this capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><placeName reg="Milliken's Bend, Madison, Louisiana" key="tgn,2515323">Milliken's Bend</placeName> completely commands the channel of the river when the water is low, as it is at present, and the party in possession of it can, in such a stage of water, absolutely stop the passage of all and every kind of craft bound either up or down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>As all the provisions for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> come from above, it will at once be seen that this conquest must prove fatal to the enterprise against <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Soldiers must eat if they be expected to fight, and if they can get nothing to eat they must fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>As far as we can see, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> cannot sustain his army without the free use of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> We have heard many and great fears expressed for the fate of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>; some have even gone so far as to say that it must fall without the interposition of a miracle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We never believed it, simply because we were well acquainted with the strength of the position, and did not imagine that it ever could be carried, provided only it were defended by a resolute governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Such a man has been found in <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>, who we believe has at last, satisfied the most skeptical of his loyalty and bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>From the river <rs>Vicksburg</rs> has had nothing to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>She is built on a high hill, and the guns of the fleet have to be aimed at such an angle that the shells pass over her, or explode in the air. There is no object of more thorough contempt to the <name>Vicksburgers</name> than the mendacious braggart <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>, who has been firing at her for a month and has not yet killed a man. On the land side again the country is peculiarly susceptible of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is broken into a wild succession of formidable hills, sometimes terminating in deep valleys, sometimes sinking sheer down into abrupt precipices, ending in bayous deep enough to swallow a considerable town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Resolutely defended, indeed it may be regarded as impregnable, and in that circumstance, and the courage of our troops, we have constantly put our faith. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Things, at last, appear to be on the point of taking a favorable change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><placeName reg="Milliken's Bend, Madison, Louisiana" key="tgn,2515323">Milliken's Bend</placeName> being in our possession, an end is put to all recruiting from above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The waters are rapidly falling, and in a week or <num value="2">two</num> will be at the lowest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The tails are slowly, but, it appears to us, surely being drawn around <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Already sickness to an alarming extent is said to prevail in his army, who are forced to drink the water of the Big Black, redolent with pestilence and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We do not wish to excite hopes that may never be realized; but for our own part &mdash; without asking anybody to share in the confidence which we feel &mdash; we are firmly persuaded that the time is not far distant when that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army will either be taken entire, or be compelled to make a disastrous retreat from the position it now occupies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Apparently, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> has been slow; but he has had to organize an army in the face of the enemy, to supply it with the munitions of war, and to encounter other unheard of difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He has surmounted them all, and now that the water is down we may expect to hear from him in a way that shall silence his detractors forever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The advantage which will accrue to our cause from the repulse of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and the salvation of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, are prodigious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We shall have made the enemy fail in the operations of a whole campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We shall have preserved a point which they consider of more importance than any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We shall have secured the trans Mississippi States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We shall be in a condition to roll back the war upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States, in co-operation with <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>These are a few, and but a few, of the least important results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Perhaps the whole Northwest, finding themselves as far off from securing the navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> as ever, may become tired of the war, and either force a peace or secede from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> It is gratifying in the extreme to learn, from the dispatches of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to the <rs>President</rs>, alluded to in another column, that our cavalry under <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> still maintains its ancient reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>For several days, so reads the report, they have met the enemy daily, and on all occasions have been victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>This is so much the more gratifying than we had been led to believe from the reports of passengers on the cars, that the sceptre was departing from us. There certainly would be nothing more mortifying to the <rs>Southern</rs> man than to see that arm of the service in which his countrymen have always been supposed to excel, represented by a race of combatants who were not able even to cope with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Nevertheless that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are straining every nerve to make discipline supply the place for natural aptitude for the cavalry service is too clear to admit of dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The time has been, and that not very long ago, when they would not have dared to project and execute such an excursion as that undertaken and successfully accomplished by <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> &mdash; when, indeed, they could not have found the men, unless they had gone to the <rs>West</rs> for them, to carry it out. There are few riders in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States, or the <rs>Middle States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They all believe in Northern trotters and carriages of some description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Yet seeing the enormous advantage of having a large body of cavalry always on hand to conduct the war on the brutal plan which they seem to have determined upon, with characteristic industry they set to work and improvised <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Their horsemen are by no means equal to ours, but they are better equipped, and ride better horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They are, therefore, so much the nearer on an equality with us, and though they cannot contend with us, man for man, in the field, they are able to work us infinite mischief.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> We observe that <num value="2">two</num> of the morning papers yesterday agreed with us in the propriety, or rather necessity of retaliating on the enemy for the wanton outrages he has inflicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>To pursue any other course of policy is to invite a renewal of the outrages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> never can be made to believe that forbearance is not fear, or that humanity, and not policy, is the rule of action of any human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He does nothing himself but from interested motives, and he measures everybody <unclear></unclear> own <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>If we do not retaliate upon him he will be sure to think it is because we are afraid to do it, and that will invite him to additional atrocities.
