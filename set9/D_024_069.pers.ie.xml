<head>The true Path to independence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> It is not alone by chivalrous and gallant deeds that the independence of our country is to be secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>If it were we should have no double of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>There never has existed yet a people who surpassed the <rs>South</rs> in its hero's and self sacrificing devotion to country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But it must be admitted that we are too fond of ease and pleasure, and it has been even doubted whether we should not now be in a better condition if the glorious victory of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> had never been achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>That wonderful <unclear></unclear> tempted us to lie on our laurels, and it was only when routed from our perilous repose by the sharp sting of adversity that we recovered our equanimity and put forth the full <num value="1">one</num> glass which the <unclear></unclear> of the contest and the persevering and implacable character of the enemy demanded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> If we will consider in what the strength of the enemy lies we shall derive some instructive lessons for ourselves, for it is lawful to learn from an enemy That strength does not consist in his numbers alone nor even principally, great as those numbers are; nor, still less in any superiority of fighting qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>We do not question the courage of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, or any other race of men, but we do not believe that they have the military aptitude of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and we know that they have not as lofty and inspiring motives in this contest as our own. --But there are qualities by which they have always been distinguished &mdash; system caution, labor, thorough attention to details, and dogged perseverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>They are made more vindictive and persistent by defeat; and their revenge seems to sharpen their families and clear their understanding, whilst they make the most of their victories, and turn them at once to practical account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Mechanical labor <sic>in in</sic> abundance among them, and they are employing all its appliances in the present war. It is undeniable that we need more system and practicality in all the departments of our Government, and in every field of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We must make a business of war, and conduct it with the same thoroughness and attention to detail that a successful business man exhibits in the conduct of his business affairs. </p>

She is at this moment suffering from the absence of manufacturing industry &mdash; a misfortune, and not altogether a fault &mdash; for, though fond of ease and leisure, she has been deprived by the policy of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> of those inducements and advantages for manufacturing and commercial enterprise which have been extended to the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>But under these disadvantages she no longer labors.--With the establishment of her independence she will no longer be forced to pay tribute to Northern taskmasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Her noble harbors will be available for her own commerce, and her unrivalled advantages in estimate, and water power for manufacturing purposes, will then be at her own disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It depends upon her use of these advantages whether the glories achieved by her arms will be of practical value and her independence be established in fact as well as in name. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> The attempt to impose the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> on the citizens of the <rs>South</rs> who may fall under their military power is <num value="1">one</num> of the most cruel of those instrumentalities of despotism which are now brought to bear upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>But, fortunately, it cannot be forced upon a community who are true to themselves and to the great cause in which they are engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>A contemporary has justly observed, &#x0022;If our citizens in every community will hang together in solid body, and every man refuse, under whatever extremity, to take the hated oath, they will find in this course their best security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>But it some yield under the influence of threats or persecutions &mdash; If a single man in a neighborhood shows himself false in the hour of trial &mdash; it will excite hope and stimulate efforts that will prove of much annoyance to the rest.--Additional appliances will be brought to bear to force others to do what <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> have done.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> Our contemporary remarks that the citizen who to save his own property, or to secure any privilege, takes the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, is a traitor not only to his own State and country generally, but is a traitor to his own neighbors. &#x0022;They have a right to hold him as their personal foe; for he separates himself from them, and stimulates against them the malice of their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>We have heard of come who without bad design, but under a terrible mistake of judgments decided to take the oath of allegiance to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>They are now of all men the most miserable and they show it in their sad countenances and hanging heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They have lost their self respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>They have lost the esteem of their neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>And we are happy to add that in almost every instance they have failed to get the price for which they sold themselves.&#x0022; Our contemporary urges that this Government should adopt the same policy to wards citizens who swear allegiance to the enemy as was pursued by <persName n="Jefferson,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> in similar circumstances, in <dateStruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></dateStruct>, towards those who come forward, in compliance with <name>British</name> requisitions and gave their parole.

<head>&#x0022;No Cards.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/> Such is the comprehensive announcement that meets the eye at the end of the newspaper items which ladies find so interesting, under the head of &#x0022;Married&#x0022;. The phrase &#x0022;no cards&#x0022; may be interpreted as follows, according to the <orgName n="New York Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">N. Y. <hi rend="italics">Journal of Commerce</hi></orgName>: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/> Owing to the hard times and the high price of stationery, the happy couple herein named have concluded to dispense with the custom of sending cards to their innumerable friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>They trust that the virtue of economy will be duly appreciated, when coal is <measure n="9dollars" type="currency">nine dollars</measure> per <num value="10">ten</num>, and the other expenses of housekeeping are in proportion, and all going up. The happy couple hope that this explanation will prove satisfactory; but, should it cause the loss of anybody's friendship, they will try to survive the affliction.&#x0022; Something to this effect, we say, was the original idea of that inventive and intrepid young couple who dared to break over a venerable conventionalism, and put &#x0022;no cards&#x0022; at the end of their advertised felicity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/> It is imitated by others &mdash; not for all these grave reasons, perhaps, but because it has become a recognized and approved (if not yet universally adopted) fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Not often is it that economy dictates the fashions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>That it has done so, in this case, is a proof of that beautiful magnanimity with which the unmarried portion of the fair sex adapt themselves to those trying circumstances in our national history, and take from the dilatory lover his last weak excuse of &#x0022;too poor; guess I'll wait till the war is over.&#x0022; When the war is over the ladies may conclude to recede from this liberty proposition, and insist on their time honored privilege of scattering showers of pasteboard over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Now is the time to make up matrimonial arrangements cheap; for the same self-sacrificing spirit that consents to &#x0022;no cards&#x0022; may possibly agree to other economical modifications of the grand budget of wedding expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>But that is a delicate point, upon which we are not now authorized to make a statement, and we must refer anxious inquiries to the only sources where they can be correctly informed, viz: the ladies &mdash; in whose opinion of the case they are <unclear></unclear> interested. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/> This partially discarded custom of sending cards was a very pretty custom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>It was pleasant to receive occasionally those double envelopes and that excess of pasteboard, tied with the emblematical silken cord, which marked an epoch in the lives and experiences of <num value="1">one</num>'s friends, and showed that <num value="1">one</num> was not forgetten in the rush of agreeable anticipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Just at this time, too, photography was beginning to find a capital use for some of that superfluous pasteboard, by copying the heads of the expectant pair upon it, and conveying to the distant friends of either party the desired information of what the other party looked like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>With the pad of the war and the return of some measure of our national prosperity, and a full in the price of stationery, the announcement of &#x0022;no cards&#x0022; may pass out of fashion, and photography give a new charm to the hymenial pasteboard of the future. </p> </q><bibl n="N.
