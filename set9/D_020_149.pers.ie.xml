<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>A code of laws, founded upon precedents of wrong, would certainly cut a very pretty figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>In common life, we would all be justified in committing theft and murder, wherever the person who was robbed or murdered, had himself been guilty of those <num value="2">two</num> crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>This is precisely the code which the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> and other savages have established, and by which they are guided in their dealings with the whites. --It is the old law of retaliation &mdash; a law abhorrent to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and fatal to civilization, which is recognized by no <name>Christian</name> nation, unless in cases where no other remedy can be had. In the history of any powerful nation that ever existed, cases may be found of violence not justified upon any principle known to <name>Christian</name> society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>To go no farther, the pages of <name>French</name> and <name>English</name> history are full of such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But nobody ever dreamed of laying them down as precedents upon which to found general maxims of law. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <persName n="Bonaparts,Consul,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparts,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Consul">Consul</roleName> <surname>Bonaparts</surname></persName> invaded the territory of <placeName key="tgn,1038098" n="1.000 3" reg="baden-wurttemberg">Baden</placeName>, which was a neutral territory, seized a political refugee by force, and had him shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Is it to be inferred therefrom that it is lawful so seize refugees upon neutral territory, and is the party so seizing allowed to justify and plead this case as a precedent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> sent a squadron to <placeName key="tgn,7003474" n="1.000 2" reg="kobenhavn,kobenhavn,danmark,europe">Copenhagen</placeName>, a neutral port, took the whole <placeName key="tgn,1000066" n="1.000 10" reg="Danmark,Europe">Danish</placeName> fleet, and bombarded the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>This was clearly a great wrong; but it furnishes a precedent if it be determined to construct a code of international law upon cases of that description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>She fired into the <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Chesapeake</rs>, a neutral vessel, made her strike her colors, boarded her, took a number of seamen from her whom she claimed to be <name>English</name> subjects, and hung several of them as deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Here was a wrong &mdash; acknowledged, we think, to be a wrong by the <rs>British Government</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Are we to form a law out of such a precedent as this, and solemnly decide that any ship of war may stop any other ship of war at sea, search her for deserters or subjects, and hang such men as are found on board coming under that category? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> <num value="2">Two</num> powerful nations engaged in war, are almost sure, amidst the excitement of a struggle for life and death, to forget that any other nation has any rights whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Such was notoriously the case during the wars which the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>English</rs> waged upon each other, during the last years of the last, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> years of the present century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>They acted precisely as though there were no other powers in existence except themselves, and they never hesitated, when the neutrality of any nation stood between them and the execution of any project which they had in view for the annoyance of each other, to violate it on the instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>They did it, however, always at their own particular risk, and in every instance paid dearly for it in the end. Thus <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> did not hesitate to march a corps of his army through the <rs type="place">Prussian territory</rs> of Bareuth, when it lay between him and the grand army, he was concentrating around him, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> did not hesitate to violate the neutrality of the <name>Porte</name> when she suspected him of a design to take part against her. Both these acts were clearly unjustifiable, or justifiable only on that plea of the tyrant, necessity, which pushed home, may be made to sanctify any and every enormity that blackens the page of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Upon these exceptional cases, or cases like them, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> wish to found their new code of international law.--They will be apt to learn, we think, that public law is not founded upon violent acts done under peculiar circumstances, but upon column decisions recognized by all the civilized world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> From all we can gather, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has acted with decision in the present emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>She feels that she has been insulted, and she will listen to no argument until the insult be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> atoned for. In the case of an individual, when he feels that an insult has been offered him, it is not usual for him, we believe, to enter into a discussion of the act conveying the insult, as to whether it really be an insult or no. It is sufficient for him that he feels it to be such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>It must be disavowed, before he can take a single step, in the direction of conciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>So, we take it, the case stands with nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>In the present instance the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> disavow the intention to insult, and prove its sincerity in such disavowal, by restoring <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> to the position they occupied when they were seized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The <rs>Welshman</rs> does neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>He is perfectly calm, but still presents the leek, and tells Pistol he must swallow it. Upon further refusal, he precedes to beat him without mercy.
