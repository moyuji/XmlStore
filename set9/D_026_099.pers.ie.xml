<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The object of the expedition was for the purpose of taking away the tobacco purchased in this city by agents of the <rs>French Government</rs> previous to the war, the arrival of which at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> had been delayed from some cause unknown to us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> It is sometimes said that if a man is to have a master it matters little who the master is, and that independence is nothing without liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/> Whether the man was ever born that is to be the master of any other man in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName> is scarcely a practical question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Speaking in a general way we should surmise that the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> entertain no such apprehensions of any mortal now born, or to be born hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>If any individual not yet launched upon the tide of time intends to be born for any such purpose, we advise him to reconsider his determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>The times and the genius of the people are not propitious to such enterprises. &#x0022;C&#x00E6;sar had his <persName n="Brutus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00338" reg="mostcommon:Brutus,nomatch:0"><surname>Brutus</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> the <genName n="1">First</genName></persName> his <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>,&#x0022; and any gentleman that undertakes to make slaves of Southern white men may profit by their example. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> The very preposterousness of such a notion exposes the serious refuter of it to the painful consequences of a writ <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">de lunatico inquirendo.</hi> </foreign> The only master who, booted and spurred, proposes to ride and lash and destroy us, is <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>She is now called upon to believe that somebody else is aspiring to be her master, and that a revolution counter to that to which she was just invited may be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Verily, as <persName n="Weller,Mister,Samuel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00341" reg="default:Weller,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName n="Samuel">Sam.</foreName> <surname>Weller</surname></persName> hath it. &#x0022;Vot a thing it is to be so sought arter.&#x0022;--But, <num value="1">one</num> at a time, gentlemen, <num value="1">one</num> at a time!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is a very robustious and long winded Commonwealth, not altogether deficient and drooping in the hour of battle, but even she, double jointed and belligerent giantess that she is, cannot carry on at the same time a revolution and counter-revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>She has been called the <rs type="role" reg="IsChild">mother of</rs> States, but whilst she can bear with fortitude the ordinary pains of ordinary parturition, she may at least desire, if <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Esau</foreName></persName> are to be born at the same time, that they will endeavor, in their nascent condition, to keep the peace, and will follow each other in due order upon the stage of public events. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> In a period of such war as that in which we are engaged, we cannot expect to enjoy all the rights, any more than all the comforts and all the security of peaceful life.--We cheerfully give up our property and our lives to be saved from that which is worse than poverty and death, and there is nothing in <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> so divine that it should not for a time go the way of all things human in this controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>It is less tyrannical to suspend the writ than to suspend the <hi rend="italics">corpus,</hi> and in a choice of masters that circumstance might be permitted without derogation to a freeman's liberty to enter into the selection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> &#x0022;If a man is to have a master, it matters little who the master is.&#x0022; We should like to know what liberty soldiers, fighting the battles of their country, enjoy, compared with citizens?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>We should like to know if the army, comprising the blood and muscle, the brain and should, of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, has not given up its liberty for a time to its military leaders and commanders, rather than to be slaves for all time to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> despotism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>If they can submit to such discipline as that of camps, why may not civilians endure for a time a milder discipline for the same patriotic purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Who believes that any restriction upon personal liberty is to last longer than the war?--Who believes that the <rs>Confederate President</rs> desires any higher glory than to conduct this great struggle to a successful conclusion, and to retire at the end of his term to private life, with the gratitude of his country and the benedictions of mankind? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/> But whilst we loathe and execrate the idea of having a master as much as any mortal man, and regard the existence of any rival with <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00342" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for that position as the very error o' the moon, we deny that it matters little, if a country is to have a master, who the master is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>But, again we say, no son of her begetting desires to be her master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>If we are wrong, if it be true, as averred, that a would be tyrant within her own borders is seeking the imperial purple, and that there is no choice between him and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00346" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, why keep our armies another day in the field?
