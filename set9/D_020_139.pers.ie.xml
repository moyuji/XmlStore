<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">The <rs>Slidell</rs> and <rs>Mason</rs> case.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> --A series of able articles has been published in the <orgName n="Richmond Whig" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi></orgName> upon this subject, which still seems to attract a large share of public attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The writer very completely disposes of the supposed right of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government in the premises, showing that none of the cases cited from the law books reach the point under discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>That point, after all, must be settled in the mind of every man by his own common sense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Why does the law of nations decide that contraband of war cannot be carried to a country at war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Is it not because a nation, professing to be neutral, has no right to assist the enemy of a nation at war, while she is herself enjoying all the privileges, immunities, and advantages of peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>And unless the property made the subject of seizure be going to the country at war, how can it benefit, or be supposed to benefit, such belligerent country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Suppose a columbiad, or a rifled cannon, or a lot of <orgName n="rifles"><persName n="Sharpe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sharpe,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharpe</surname></persName>'s rifles</orgName>, or powder, or anything else of a contraband character, should be found at sea, on a neutral vessel on its way to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, a country neutral in this war, could it be lawfully seized, even though it should prove to have been shipped from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Unquestionably it could not, for the simple reason that it is not coming <hi rend="italics">to</hi> the country of war, and therefore cannot be designed for its benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>And yet these articles are clearly contraband of war. The law means nothing more than to prevent a country at war from receiving aid from a country at peace, to the detriment of the other belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Even though the guns and ammunition were designed for the <rs>British</rs> navy or army, and though the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> might suspect a disposition on the part of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to favor the <q> &#x0022;Rebels,&#x0022;</q> we conceive it could not be lawfully done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> But suppose the ships in question to have sailed from a neutral port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Does any man dispute the right of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to take cannon, or powder, or any other implement or munition of war, on board of her ships, and carry them to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>And if she has the right to take on board and to carry to <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> these articles, why has she not the right to take on board and carry ambassadors or commissioners, allowing them even, to be contraband of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But they are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> contraband, and the expression of <persName n="Scott,Sir,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Scott,William,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, (<q>&#x0022;you may arrest your enemy's ambassador on his passage,&#x0022;</q>) which was torn from its context to support this proposition, is found, when restored to its connection, to establish no such doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Nor does the case of the <rs>Marshal Belleisle</rs>, which has been so often cited, establish any such principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>That officer, appointed by <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="15">XV</genName></persName> ambassador to a neutral court, was seized in <placeName reg="Hannover, Niedersachsen, Deutschland" key="tgn,1002450">Hanover</placeName>, a part of the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>'s dominions, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> being then at war with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>To have made the cases parallel, our commissioners should have been arrested in some of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Nobody contends that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would not have had a right to arrest them on his own ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> It is, however, as we have often said before, useless to argue this point, and we only do it in obedience to the general taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Most assuredly, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> will not be influenced in the slightest degree, by any view of the subject taken by anybody on this side of the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Her rulers have never wanted law to justify anything they might wish to do, or to leave undone, whenever the act or the omission might be favorable to the interests of her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In the present case, there are strong reasons why she should pocket the affront.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Her subjects hold stocks in Yankeedom, to the value of <num value="500">five hundred</num>, <num value="1000000">million</num>, and, probably, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s subjects owe her <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>These debts and securities would instantly be confiscated in the event of a war, and should she even be so far successful as to plant the lion upon the <rs>Capitol</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, after having captured every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> seaport, and sunk every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ship &mdash; after having dictated peace and placed her foot on the neck of all Yankeedom &mdash; she would hardly ever be able to realize the amount from a people so utterly impoverished.--The commercial distress that would follow the destruction of so much <name>English</name> wealth, in the meantime, would reduce <num value="1000">thousands</num> to beggary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Besides, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has now the largest commercial marine in the world, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, since this war broke out, have had scarcely any foreign trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The contest, in this view of the case, would be very unequal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <rs>English</rs> would have all to loose, and nothing to gain, by a war on such terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>These considerations may possibly induce her to overlook the affront offered to her sovereignty, or at most to rest satisfied with an explanation, or something very far short of what she has a just right to claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The <rs>Florida</rs> fought at great disadvantage in <num value="1">one</num> respect, owing to her steering apparatus being out of order, but showed a decided superiority in the effectiveness of her armament.
