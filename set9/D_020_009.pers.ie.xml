<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName> <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num></hi> could not have announced the absolutism of established powers in more latitudinous and unqualified terms than the <rs>Northern President</rs> has done in his denial of the right of secession to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The whole gist of his argument in the <name>Message</name> consists in the proposition that the right of secession would destroy all government; and that, in crushing secession, the <rs>Government</rs> is preserving its own existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>This was, in brief, the language of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, and all the armaments which that mistaken power sent out to crush the rebellion of the <name>Colonies</name>, were sent for the maintenance of that very proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>All that the <name>Colonies</name> demanded in the <name>Revolution</name>, after <date value="1776-07-04">July 4th, 1776,</date> was the right of separate and independent government; and that is all the <rs>South</rs> demands at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The colonists declared, in opposition to the pretensions of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName>,</hi> that the right of secession was inherent in man for sufficient cause; and that is what the <rs>South</rs> maintains at this time, in opposition to the sophistries of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> The proposition of <hi rend="smallcaps">North</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName></hi> holds good only this far, that the right of Secession does not exist for insufficient causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>It is only the abuse of the power that is unlawful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>If <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName></hi> had confined his denial to the abuse of the right of Secession, what he has said against it would have been true, and the fallacy of his argument consists in ignoring the distinction between the abuse of the right and the right itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The fathers of the country felt it incumbent upon them to declare to the world the causes which impelled them to the separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>In that declaration was implied the admission that unless the causes were adequate their disturbance of the existing order of things was to be condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>So have the <rs>South</rs> felt that their act of Secession was only to be justified if impelled by sufficient cause; and they have taken repeated occasion to announce and explain these causes to the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> The great moral issue between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the <name>Colonies</name> was, whether the conduct of the mother country to its dependencies had been such as to justify the divorce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The fathers declared that it had been such, and they rested their justification upon this issue of fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>They did not claim an arbitrary right, on more volition and without provocation, to break up and rend to pieces established governments and long existing political associations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> In like manner, the great moral issue between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> is, whether the conduct of the <rs>Abolition States</rs> towards the slaveholding ones has been such as to justify a divorce &mdash; whether the positive wrong and incompatibility of temper have been such as to render separation advisable and necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The South has never asserted the right to break up the <rs>Union</rs> from more caprice and without justifying cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>They assert the right of Secession <hi rend="italics">for cause,</hi> just as the fathers did in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, and just as the <name>Revolution</name> itself established it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>This is a most valuable, a most sacred right &mdash; a right which, we hope and believe, is to liberate the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing Government may choose to exercise it.--any portion of such people that <hi rend="italics">can, may revolutionize,</hi> and make their <hi rend="italics">own</hi> of so much of the territory as they inhabit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>More than this, <hi rend="italics">a majority of any portion</hi> of such people may revolutionize, put down a <hi rend="italics">minority,</hi> intermingled with, or near about them, who may oppose their movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Such minority was precisely the case of the <name>Tories</name> of our own Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It is a quality of revolutions not to go by <hi rend="italics">old</hi> lines or <hi rend="italics">old</hi> laws, but to break up both and make new ones.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Congressional Globe,"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> It is quite delightful and refreshing to observe the parrot-like facility with which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press takes of the <q>&#x0022;Southern Rebels.&#x0022;</q> There is something so novel and exhilarating to people who never owned a servant, to whom no <num value="1">one</num> was ever low enough to acknowledge allegiance, who cannot in general compel even a horse to admit their supremacy, in the idea of anybody on the face of the earth <hi rend="italics">rebelling</hi> against <hi rend="italics">them,</hi> that they ought to be profoundly grateful to the whole <rs>South</rs> for affording them an opportunity to entertain themselves with such an exquisite illusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> It is true, that we are unable to discover the applicability of the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The South never rebelled against the <rs>Constitution</rs>, nor do we understand how any State can rebel against the <rs>Union</rs>, which was but the creation of the <name>States</name>, any more than any other principals can rebel against their agents.--But we prefer to look at the thing in the light which <q>&#x0022;tickles&#x0022;</q> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> so hugely, viz: a rebellion against Yankeedom, against <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> manufactures, and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lords and masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The idea of rebelling against <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may annoy sensitive people, but to our mind it is so ludicrous and diverting that we shall never want to be called anything but rebel till the day of our death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>If ever a monetary gloom overspreads our horizon, if troubles come upon us, friends depart, and the shades of life's evening become prematurely dark, this idea of rebelling against a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> would chase everything like serious reflection from our minds, and bring a broad grin even upon the cheek of Despair. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> We by no means confound the whole <rs>North</rs> with that <q>&#x0022;peculiar people,&#x0022;</q> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.--Nor are all <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who are born and live in Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>But take them as a whole, we can safely say that rebellion to them &mdash; their morality, religion, manners, philosophy &mdash; is obedience to Heaven.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> It was a strange sight &mdash; that long range of cotton bales &mdash; a new material for breastworks --with the crowd of human beings behind, their heads only visible above the lines of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>We could distinctly see their long rifles lying over the bales, and the battery of <persName n="Coffee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Coffee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Coffee</surname></persName> directly in front, with its great mouth gaping towards us, and the position of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, with his staff around him.--But what attracted our attention most, was the figure of a tall man standing on the breast-works, dressed in linsey-woolsey, with buck-skin leggings, and a broad-brimmed felt hat, that fell around his face, almost concealing his features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>He was standing in <num value="1">one</num> of those picturesque and graceful attitudes peculiar to those natural man-dwellers in the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The body rested on the left leg, and swayed with a curved line upwards; the right arm was extended, the hand grasping the rifle near the muzzle, the butt of which rested near the toe of his right foot, while with his hand he raised the rim of his hat from his eyes, and seemed gazing from beneath intently upon our advancing column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The cannon of Coffee had opened upon us, and tore through our ranks with dreadful slaughter; but we continued to advance, unwavering and cool, as if nothing threatened our progress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> The roar of cannon seemed to have no effect upon the figure standing on the cotton bales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>At last he moved, threw back the hat-rim over the crown with his left hand, raised the rifle to his shoulder, and took aim at our group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Our eyes were rivetted on him. At whom had he levelled his piece?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But the distance was so great that we looked at each other and smiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>We saw the rifle flash, and my light-hand companion, as noble a looking fellow as ever rode at the head of a regiment, fell from his saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The hunter paused for a few moments, without moving his gun from his shoulder, then re-loaded, and resumed his former attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Throwing the hat-rim over his eyes, and again holding it up with his left hand, he fixed his piercing gaze upon us, as if hunting out another victim.--Once more the hat-rim was thrown back, and the gun raised to his shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>This time we did not smile, but cast short glances at each other, to see which of us must die, and when the rifle again flashed another of us dropped to the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>There was something awful in thus marching on to certain death. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>We cared not for them &mdash; there was a chance of escaping unscathed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Most of us had walked upon batteries a <num value="100">hundred</num> times more destructive, without quelling; but to know that every time that rifle was levelled towards us, and its bullet sprang from the barrel, <num value="1">one</num> of us must surely fall; to see the gleaming sun flash as the deadly iron came down, and see it rest motionless, as if poised upon a rock, and know when the hammer struck, and the sparks flew to the full- primed pan, that the messenger of death drove unerring to its goal &mdash; to know this, and still march on, was awful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> I could see nothing but the tall figure standing on the breastwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>He seemed to grow, phantom like, taller and taller, assuming through the smoke the supernatural appearance of some <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Again did he reload and discharge his rifle with the same unfailing aim, and it was with indescribable pleasure that I beheld, as we neared the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> lines, the sulphurous smoke gather around us and shut that spectral hunter from my gaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>We lost the battle, and to my mind the <rs>Kentucky</rs> rifleman contributed more to our defeat than anything else; for, while he remained to our sight, our attention was drawn from our duties, and when at last we became enshrouded in the smoke, the work was complete; we were in utter confusion and unable in the extremity to restore order sufficient to make any successful attack. </p>
