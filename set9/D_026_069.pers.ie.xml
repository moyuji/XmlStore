<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> thus explains the reasons of this call: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> This call is not entirely unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It may not be generally known, but it is nevertheless strictly true, that under the last call for <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> <hi rend="italics">additional </hi> men in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, the <rs>Government</rs> has actually received a far less number of men than it called for, though most of the <name>States</name> have filled their quotas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The reason is plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It was announced that the last call was for the purpose of squaring up accounts, and thereupon an extensive system of research and figuring was begun in every State; all loose accounts of Provost Marshals and State authorities were balanced up; old credits, not before allowed, were brought forward and allowed on the new quota; scattering men, who had enlisted and never been credited, were counted for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time; enlistments in the naval service have been credited as recently allowed by law; the veteran enlistments, which came in largely, were credited, and aided many localities to escape the draft; every exertion, and many systems of figuring, some of which we fear were not as straight forward as they ought to have been, were used, until many of the <name>States</name> have announced that their quotas were full under all calls, with a surplus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We have in memory at present <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs>, <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and many parts of <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, New York, and <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, all of which have filled their quotas under all calls, and most of them have a surplus left, which is being constantly increased by veteran and volunteer enlistments heretofore not credited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The army has, notwithstanding, been largely and gratifyingly augmented, but not, by any means, to the extent of the last call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>That call, as we have said, has been largely exhausted by the credits for old enlistments never before counted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Hence, this new call, though succeeding so rapidly to that of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, can and will be promptly met in most of the <name>States</name> without any hardship whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Many localities have a surplus already to be credited on the new quota, while the necessities of the naval service, including the <orgName type="mil" key="MarineCorps">Marine Corps</orgName>, offer a larger field than heretofore for the choice of the volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Only in those localities which have been habitually behind in every quota will the new call be considered as a hardship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This quota filled promptly and honestly, and the army will be so strengthened that we think all future calls can be dispensed with. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Times"></bibl></cit>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/> Before taking up arms every effort to obtain the peaceful enjoyment of your rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs> had been exhausted, your appeals for justice spurned with contempt, and a war to subjugate our sister States of the <rs>South</rs> commenced by <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00296" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/> By this lawless proceeding the <rs>Federal Administration</rs> threw off the mask it had hitherto worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>In such a contest <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> could not remain an indifferent spectator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Bound by every tie of blood, sympathy, common interests and common wrongs to the <name>States</name> against whom this hostile preparation was set on feet, she withdrew at once from an association which no longer respected a written Constitution, and resolved to receive on her own bosom the threatened shock of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>She invoked you to rally to defend your homes, your altars and your honor; and this appeal was not made in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Promptly and generously you responded to the call of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Most faithfully have you performed it. In your long and arduous service you have shrunk from no toil, no danger and no scarifies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>During your absence in the field, your wives and little ones may have suffered want; your homes been ravaged and the fruits of <unclear></unclear> destroyed by a ruthless and barbarous enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>But in despite of every temptation you have never looked back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Your eye has always been fixed on the foe and your ear waiting for the summons to battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Amid the toil of the march, the weary watch, the labor, the hunger, the cold, the privations of the camp, you have never complained, but have always rendered a cheerful obedience to the <rs>State</rs> which honors and cherishes you with a mother's love. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/> You have been present in most of the important battles of the war, and in all your valor has been conspicuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>It has made you the theme of praise by your heroes companions from other States, and by the whole civilized world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/> Many of your comrades have fallen in battle, or from disease contracted in service, and been transferred from the roll of life to that of immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>There are many more whose <unclear> </unclear> forms attest their honorable devotion to their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> In your prolonged absence from home, your sacrifice of personal interests, and of all the enjoyments of life has, indeed, been great.--The war, forced upon us by the malice of a people whom we had not injured, has entailed upon us all deep sorrow and cruel suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Its unavoidable calamities have been greatly augmented by the refusal of the enemy to respect the laws of civilized warfare, and by their fiendish attempt to wrest submission from us by visiting the most relentless barbarities upon women and children, the aged and the helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/><unclear></unclear> license has been given to their sapidity, untold <num value="1000000">millions</num> of property have been want only destroyed by their malice or swelled the coffers of the pampered villains, who, unwhipped of justice, have been openly rewarded and promoted for their crimes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/> Aged and unoffending men have been dragged from their beds to dreary prisons and salibary labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Refined and Virtuous women have been brutally insulted, and, manicled by rude, unfeeling, soldiery, have been led captive from their homes as hostages for negroes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/> Farms have been desolated dwellings have been laid in ashes, unprotected women and helpless children have been burned set from their homes without bread or shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The tombs of the gallant dead have been robbed and desecrated by fiends, who have ruthlessly invaded the sanctity of the grave and outraged the sensibilities of the living. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/> Under the hypocritical guise of liberating from slavery a population happier and more virtuous than themselves, they have sought to subject us to a yoke more galling than they have essayed to remove. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/> Within a few days past an expedition has been projected and an shortive effort made to carry into execution, with <unclear></unclear> instructions emanating (as we have reasons to believe from the government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to sack and fire the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and in the darkness of night to consign its inhabitants, without a moment's warning, to flames and to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>For this purpose a special &#x0022;burning party&#x0022; was organised, provided with implements of destruction, and orders to carry into execution the fell design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Among its blazing ruins the released prisoners from &#x0022;<placeName reg="Belie Isle">Belie Isle</placeName>&#x0022; and &#x0022;The <placeName reg="Libby, Cleburne, Arkansas" key="tgn,2446819">Libby</placeName>&#x0022; were to unite with the bands of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00297" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> and <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00298" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> in dearing out death and slaughter upon unoffending and peaceful citizens, and inflicting outrage upon pure and unprotected women more horrible than death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/> The heart sickens at the contemplation of the enormities that would have been committed had the nefarious scheme succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>No prayer for mercy would have been heard, no scream for help would have been headed.--Fire, rapine, slaughter and last would have held undisputed dominion in this fair city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/> We forbear to enlarge, but make this recital that you may know more clearly the character of our foe, and that he may be held up to the odium and execration of mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/> In shameless disregard of all the rules of civilized warfare, your <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> and his Cabinet were, by special directions, to be denied the rights of prisoners of war and killed in cold blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/> Every species of public and private property was to be destroyed, and the entire country within their reach laid waste. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> Stimulated and encouraged by the precepts and example of their leader of rullers and murderers entered private houses, broke open ladies wardrobes, destroyed off their rich contents what they could not appropriate, carried off jewels and plate, consigned to the flames stores of provisions, burnt mills and other houses, desolated some of the fairest homes of the <rs>State</rs>, and left whole families without food. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/> Thanks to the gallantry of a citizen soldiery, they were routed and repulsed in the midst of this carnival of crime, which must outrage the sensibilities of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Many of them, with awakened consciousness of their deserts, now contemplate their doom within the walls of a prison from which they hope to release their companions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/> An avenging <name n="God" type="God">God</name> suddenly summoned their atrocious leader from the scene of his wickedness to the bar of judgment, and on his slain body were found his atrocious instructions, stained with his own blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>The name of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> will be handed down to history as a fit associate in infamy with <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="nearbymention:Butler,B.,F.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> and a host of lesser criminals; who have disgraced humanity and shocked the moral sense of the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> But in these very atrocities you will discern the motive, if any were needed, for continued service and fresh sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> taken no step backward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Every consideration of honor, interest, duty and safety demand that we shall go forward in the grand struggle for human rights and human liberty, so bravely began, and so manfully maintained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/> After all that we have suffered and endured, subjugation or submission to the cruel foe, would reduce us to a degree of degradation and misery which has no parallel in the history of civilization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> The sacrifices of blood and treasure that we have expended &mdash; the memories of the noble martyrs who have freely given their lives for the achievement of our independence, forbid that we should needlessly throw away what has been already won, in the vain hope of obtaining peace or security. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/> Nothing but wretchedness and untold misery await us, if we stop short of the unconditional acknowledgement of our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>This your valor will surely command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Men of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> you are soldiers of a renowned Commonwealth, whose fame you have illustrated and borne aloft on every battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>We need not unfold to you the muniments of your right to self Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>We are assured that you fully comprehend the necessity of a successful assertion of that right, and that you will never lay down your arms until you have secured it. Born to an inheritance of freedom, you cannot hesitate to choose between slavery or death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Submission to an enemy who has exhausted every infamy is not endurable even in thought; but were we base enough to desire peace upon any terms less than the unqualified recognition of our independence, self-interest alone would teach us the folly of relying upon the forbearance of a nation, who have shown in every step of the war that their faith is perfidy, and their only policy is rapine, plunder and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>The whole history of our former association with the <rs>Northern States</rs> admonishes us that in a common Government they will never fall to employ their power to take away our property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Their present malice springs chiefly from baffled cupidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>But for this master passion of their nature, an honorable and speedy peace would be easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The war has fully developed all their purposes, and you now know the fate that awaits you in the event of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Your liberties will utterly perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Your State organization will be blotted out. All your property of <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> every description will be confiscated, for all of us have participated in the revolution. --Your lands will be divided out among the banditti from the <rs>North</rs> and from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, who have invaded our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>A free negro population will be established in your midst, who will be your social equals and military governors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Negro guards will, at their pleasure, give you passes and safe conducts, or arrest you to be tried and punished by negroes commandants and magistrates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>And to these, yourselves, your wives and children will be mental laborers and slaves, except those of you whom the malice of your enemies shall reserve for the dungeon or the gallows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/> Such is the deem denounced for the people of the <rs>South</rs> by the wicked race now warring upon us. But we know it can never be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>An army of veterans have received that their country <hi rend="italics">shall</hi> not be enslaved; and while their purpose stands the enemy's designs will continue to be baffled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Among you there is <num value="1">one</num> spirit-that of eager and resolute determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The temper of the army has reached the people at home, and inspired them with a fresh courage and a more assured confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Everywhere we see multiplied evidences of energy and enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>In all the <name>States</name> we find the resolution to endure every extremity rather than submit, and with this spirit our people are invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The armies are filling up their ranks, and the legislation of Congress has added still further to their numbers and efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Those citizens who remain at home to carry on the industrial pursuits essential to the support of the army will see to it that you shall not want for food while you are exposing your lives to protect their property and homes from rapine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The defence of the country has become its business, and every citizen is required to contribute to it in his proper sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> has taken steps to aid those families of her soldiers who may be in want, and it will not fail to do all in its power to provide for and cherish them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>They have authorized and directed the purchase or impressment of unlimited supplies for their maintenance, appropriated <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">one million dollars</measure> for the relief of such as are within the lines of the enemy, and half a <num value="1000000">million</num> as a hospital fund for the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>An organized agency of the <rs>State</rs> distributes the voluntary contributions of patriotic citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Individually and collectively, in county, city, and State organizations, the people with <num value="1">one</num> accord are determined to feed, clothe sustain and cherish the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> On the other hand, your enemies are appalled by the magnitude of the task before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The loud <unclear>astings</unclear> which a few weeks since they so freely uttered, have been silenced by your unanimous reenlistments for the war, and the stern and resolute bearing of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Discussions exist among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Eager to possess the spoils of their corrupt and profligate Government, they hate each other nearly as much as they do us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> The war is no longer popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The rich are allowed to buy an exemption, and thus cast all the burden and risk upon the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The laboring classes have already revolted against the draft. --To escape its odium, enormous bounties have been offered to volunteers; but all these expedients have failed, and again a heavy draft has been ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>The armies of the enemy are every day diminishing, and it is evident they cannot recruit them to the number with which they began the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>A large and growing party are for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>A still larger party have discovered that the war has so far only served to entail upon themselves a despotism which tramples down every public and private right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>They feel and acknowledge that they are the slaves of <num value="1">one</num> whose character has made him odious to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Torn by party and persons strife, and conscious of the impotence of their scheme of conquest, the ranks of your enemies are already beginning to waver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/><num value="1">One</num> more resolute effort and the day is ours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will strengthen your arms in the hour of battle, and give his blessings to a just cause independence and peace will be conceded by your enemies, and you, the defenders of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, may return to your homes to received the welcome due to the brave, and to enjoy those honors which will grow brighter as your years shall be prolonged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> And when your care shall be no longer startled by the <unclear></unclear> arms,&#x0022; and a happy, prosperous, and permanent peace shall succeed, returning from the fields of your fames you will be greeted with tears of joy by the loved ones at home &mdash; the heroes of every circle &mdash; to receive the smiles of the fair, and become the theme of gratitude and praise around every hearthstone protected by your valor. </p> 
<p>
