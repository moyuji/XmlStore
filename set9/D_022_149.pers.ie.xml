<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> Compelled to take the river route, I may have leisure to give you some report of matters and things seen and heard in this section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Having concluded the statement of what I witnessed of the <q>&#x0022;evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> my correspondence must contain merely matters of less importance and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>It is said <q>&#x0022;an active mind, like the <name>Kollan</name> harp, seizes even the vagrant winds and makes them music.&#x0022;</q> The heat and fatigues of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> have left neither mind nor body <q>&#x0022;active,&#x0022;</q> and as for the <q>&#x0022;vagrant winds,&#x0022;</q> there is not much air stirring to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Here goes <hi rend="italics">currents calami</hi>--<q>&#x0022;current calamity&#x0022;</q> --although we are not moving up stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>That reminds me that last night, about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, a negro passenger attempted to draw a bucket of water, while the boat was in motion, but was himself drawn overboard and drowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The current swept him down so fast the small boat dispatched to his assistance could not rescue him. All thought of the accident seemed to vanish as quickly as the waters closed over their suddenly summoned victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/><num value="1">One</num> thing I was pleased to see, and the fact may teach a lesson: Although the steamer was full of citizens and soldiers, just from camps and cities, where all sale of liquor was prohibited, and the bar on the boat was kept open day and night, yet there was very little drinking, much less than was formerly indulged in. This shows that the rigid military closing of all drinking saloons has already worked a partial reformation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The appetite, no longer constantly fed and <q>&#x0022;growing by what it feeds upon,&#x0022;</q> has been weakened, and may be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>I am satisfied that if the whole system of <q>&#x0022;retailing liquors&#x0022;</q> was prohibited perpetually for all time to come, it would be a blessing to the country; and this can and should be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Neither buyer nor seller are profited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Destroy the facility of obtaining liquor <hi rend="italics">by the drink,</hi> and the crop of drunkards would soon be diminished and die out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> We published the other day an extract from the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, in which the writer undertake to explain the attitude of the <rs>French Emperor</rs> with regard to the contending parties in this war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>He has therefore determined to take the matter into his own hands, and to intervene after a fashion that cannot but prove successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>He is to insist upon it that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> submit at once to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and take them for their masters without any further resistance to their demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Then the <rs>Emperor</rs> will have cotton, and that seems to be the grand object of all the diplomacy extant in the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> world at the present time of writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/><rs type="role" reg="Emperor">The Emperor</rs> is to lay aside his predilections for universal suffrage, and to settle our affairs on a basis different from that on which he has been tofore been accustomed to settle the affairs of the several <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> States whom he has been so kind as to take under his protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The people will have something to say in the matter, and they will enter into no arrangement which supposes the continued existence of our political association with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>They hate them with a deadly his tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>They always felt a contempt for them; but that contempt has been raised into fury by their invasion and all the abominations which it brought along with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>If <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">the Emperor</rs> should succeed in forcing such a settlement, he will not be enabled to get a pound of cotton for his pains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The Southern people have that cotton in their possession, and they can burn it to prevent its falling into <hi rend="italics">his</hi> hands, just as well as they can burn it to prevent its being taken by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> The agency so blatantly claimed by the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> in moulding and shaping the <name>Newspaper</name> press of the <rs>North</rs> after its own model, is not altogether without foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Before the establishment of that Journal, newspapers were grave and dignified chroniclers of important events, personalities and gossip being dismissed with very brief notice, or none at all. Great public interests, social, industrial, and political and important public events, formed the staple of their publications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/><persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName>, an uneducated and mercenary foreign adventurer, inaugurated a new era. He made the newspapers a vehicle of tattle and personalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>He made it a mere gossip, going from door to door and circulating all the scandal of the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>He established in imitation of the foreign journals, a system of correspondence in the principal cities and towns, and these emissaries of his only wrote such things as would please their employer and tickle a shallow and depraved public taste; truth being entirely a secondary consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Most of the <rs>Northern</rs> papers have followed in the wake of the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> the only difference being an affectation of gentility and refinement, which <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> never sets up. It must be admitted that he is free from <num value="1">one</num> vice &mdash; hypocrisy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>With brazen effrontery he flaunts his prostitution in the midday sun, and glories in his shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>His imitators are more demure and decorous, but quite as corrupt and unprincipled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> If our readers are often startled and amazed by the shocking mendacity of the <rs>Northern</rs> press in relation to this war, their wonder would all cease could they lift the veil and look upon the secret springs of the machinery and the persons by whom they are worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>A very instructive book was written on this subject a few years ago by a gentleman who had been connected with the <rs>Northern</rs> press for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, and was thoroughly conversant with its principles and practices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can read this book without being satisfied that the press, at the <rs>North</rs>, instead of being a <q>&#x0022;palladium of liberty,&#x0022;</q> and a reformer and instructor of the people is an engine of political despotism, a debaucher of public and private virtue, a blind leader of the blind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>There would be more solid knowledge in the <rs>North</rs>, and infinitely more personal honor, patriotism, and purity, if a newspaper had never been published within its limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The volume which shows up this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper world gives a history of its conductors, which proves that they are often incompetent, both by education and character for the positions which they occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>In many cases, foreigner adventurers, who had been compelled to leave <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> on account of their had habits, and even of acts which might have brought them within the clutches of the law, compose the editorial staff of leading journals in the principal Northern cities, and are the recognized teachers and guides of the <rs>Northern</rs> people. </p> 
<p>
