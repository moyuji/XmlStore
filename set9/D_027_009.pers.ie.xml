<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Rumors were abundant on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and, as usual, some of them were too absurd to be entitled to any consideration, while others, strange to say, proved truthful in substance, and to these we may briefly allude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Therefore was circulated early in the day that the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> <term type="ship">cruiser</term> <rs type="ship">Alabama</rs> had been sunk in an engagement with the <unclear></unclear> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Kearsage</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This turned out to be correct, so far as the accounts given in Northern papers can be relied upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>These will be found in another column of this paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>From the same sources we learn that a Confederate force is invading <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and creating no little excitement in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Numerous are the rumors connected with this movement, but as we have only <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> authority for believing it is on foot, we decline to ventilate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was reported yesterday that a portion of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had crossed to the north side of <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName>, but this has been so often repeated that we attach but little importance to it. If <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> should conclude to change his base again he will find his stubborn adversary still in his front, and prepared to dispute his advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Another report is that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> has turned up before <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and occupied a portion of <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the absence of official information we are not prepared to vouch for the truth of this statement. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>From <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> In our report on Saturday we stated that everything was quiet in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> on the day previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This was the state of affairs until about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the afternoon, at which hour the enemy made a demonstration for the purpose of feeling our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Accounts differ as to the nature of this affair, <num value="1">one</num> of which, from a trustworthy source, states that it was exceedingly trivial, amounting to less than the daily firing of the sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Another account says that the enemy made <num value="2">two</num> assaults upon our left and centre, both of which were successfully met and handsomely repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is added that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> suffered heavily, while our loss was very slight; that the coolness of our men and the steadiness of their aim told with fearful effect upon the ranks of the vandals, causing them to recoil in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We are disposed to believe that this account is exaggerated, and that the affair was simply a demonstration, with no actual assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Our information on this point is derived from a gentleman every way entitled to credit, and who has ample means of learning the progress of events on the lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> the enemy kept up a furious shelling of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> until about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>. The ponderous missiles were thrown at the rate of from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="6">six</num> per minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This barbarous practice is doubtless very gratifying to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but fails to have any effect beyond annoying the non combatants in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> nothing of especial interest occurred, except the usual picket and artillery firing.--With <num value="2">two</num> large armies confronting each other in such close proximity, it would seem almost impossible to prevent an engagement, yet <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> seems not at all disposed to take the <sic>initaive,</sic> or to butt his head against the immovable breastworks of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Yesterday, up to the time the train <unclear></unclear> for <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 12" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, there was little or no <unclear></unclear>, and the report brought by passengers was--&#x0022;all quiet in front.&#x0022; How long this state of affairs will continue, there is no prophet wise enough to foretell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Meanwhile the enemy, having contracted his lines as much as possible, has been engaged for a few days past in strengthening his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><placeName reg="New batteries">New batteries</placeName> have been created, and new breastworks constructed all along his lines, but particularly on his left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This does not look much as if he designed a speedy abandonment of that line of operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <persName n="Arnold,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut. Col.</roleName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6GARegiment">6th Georgia regiment</orgName>, was instantly killed in the trenches on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, by a shell, which exploded near him. He was a deserving and gallant officer, and much beloved by the troops whom he commanded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The train last evening brought over <num value="10">ten</num> more of <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s straggling <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raiders, who were picked up in the woods in <placeName reg="Dinwiddie, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002336">Dinwiddie county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Deserters, stragglers and escaped <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners can now be found at almost any point in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, but when bagged they constitute a very worthless and unprofitable stock to have on hand. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>A rumored raid.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> It was rumored yesterday, upon what authority we know not, that a party of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raiders appeared in the neighborhood of the <rs type="place">Yellow Tavern</rs>, in <placeName reg="Hanover county, Virginia" key="tgn,1002451">Hanover county</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This should be taken with many grains of allowance, as yesterday was Sunday and rumors of all kinds remarkably scarce. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Last night there was no official news from our armies either in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>. --The report to which we alluded some days ago, that the enemy was preparing for a demonstration against <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, is ascertained to be correct, though in what force, or from what direction, we have no definite information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In official quarters no credit is attached to the report that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> has gone to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>: though it is doubtless true that the enemy has redoubled his exertions to effect the reduction of that city. </p> </div4> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> That has happened which we were confident would happen, as soon as we learned that the <rs>Alabama</rs> had gone out to meet the <rs>Kearsage</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>She has been sunk, after a desperate resistance &mdash; sunk, as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, in the true spirit of gasconade, announce, &#x0022;In <num value="150">150</num> fathoms of water,&#x0022;--as if it made any difference whether she were sunk in <num value="100">one hundred</num> fathoms or <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>As soon as we saw that the weight of metal on board the <rs type="ship">Kearsage</rs> was so much greater than the weight of metal on board the <rs type="ship">Alabama</rs>, we could fore see no other result, unless <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> could succeed in boarding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>This he would no doubt have effected had he not been crippled by the passage of a shot through the boiler of the <rs>Alabama</rs>, early in the action, thus rendering the proper working of the ship impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Foiled in this effort, he had no resource but to fight his ship under all disadvantages, as long as she could float.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>This he did. He struck her colors only when she was sinking, and even then with the sole object of saving the lives of his brave and devoted crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>With a barbarism perfectly characteristic, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> continued to fire on the <rs>Alabama</rs> after she had struck, and while she was rapidly sinking, the object evidently being to destroy as many lives as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>She sunk at last, before a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hand had been laid upon her. &#x0022;Shrined in her own grand element,&#x0022; after a career such as no ship of modern days has run, she sleeps the sleep of glory, to be forgotten when ware are a dream of the past, and the record of battles no longer excites the curiosity or stimulates the order of mankind, but not till then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The injury she has done the enemy during her long and glorious career is without example in the history of a single ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/><persName n="Drake,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Drake,nomatch:0"><surname>Drake</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hawkins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Hawkins,W.,W.,,:1"><surname>Hawkins</surname></persName>, Dampierre, <persName><foreName>Anson</foreName></persName>, and <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>, all put together, never took so many prizes or destroyed so much property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>When before did <num value="2">two</num> ships ever render it so utterly unsafe for the nation having the largest commercial navy in the world to navigate the ocean, as to make it absolutely necessary to discontinue sea voyages, and transfer all commodities of merchandize to neutral bottoms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>This the <rs>Alabama</rs> and the <rs>Florida</rs> have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>They have driven <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce from the ocean, and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> merchants can only ensure safety to their ventures by covering them with the <rs>British</rs> flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> The high spirit of <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> would not allow him to decline a challenge, and we are hardly sorry, notwithstanding the issue of the contest, that he did not.--Yet he might have felt assured that no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> would send him a challenge unless he were and knew himself to be greatly his superior in every possible respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The <rs>Kearsage</rs> is built for a war ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>She has bulwarks of enormous strength, capable of resisting the heaviest shot, and was, besides, protected by chain plate of formidable resisting capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>On the contrary, the <rs>Alabama</rs> was built entirely for speed, and was intended merely to pursue and destroy the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce, not to fight their ships of war. The <rs>Kearsage</rs> had a picked crew &mdash; a crew picked out of <num value="40000">40,000</num> sailors &mdash; the best crew, beyond a doubt, that could have been selected from the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>But, above all, the metal of the <rs>Kearsage</rs> was immensely heavier than the metal of the <rs>Alabama</rs>, and no superiority of courage or seamanship can overcome a great inferiority in that respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>That was the reason why, in the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Constitution</rs> took the <name>Guerrero</name> in <measure n="29minutes" type="date">twenty-nine minutes</measure>. The Constitution carried <num value="32">32</num>'s and <num value="24">24</num>'s; the <name>Guerrero</name> <num value="24">24</num>'s and <num value="18">18</num>'s. The weight of broadside of the former was <num value="728">728</num>, of the latter <num value="504">504</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>The difference carried the day. It was a grown man beating a child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>The <rs>Guerrero</rs> became unmanageable at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> broadside, and her gigantic adversary lay to and struck her where she wished, cutting her up so entirely in <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure> that she was obliged to be burned.
