<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> Bushel by bushel, carl-load by cart-load, the wall has been chipped off, until nothing is left but a gray, ragged mass of mortar, from which project the outlines of former casemates, heavy beams and iron bars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The berm or base is literally covered with the <hi rend="italics">debris,</hi> amid which, at every step as you climb over the great fragments of stone and brick that have fallen from the parapet, you tread on broken projectiles of the enemy scattered in pieces whose weight varies from an ounce to a <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>. The <rs type="place">Sullivan's Island</rs> face is less shattered; but even here the pits are deep, and huge piles of material torn from the edge of the parapet by the over-shot balls have fallen on the rocks below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>On the <rs type="place">Morris's Island</rs> face the spectacle baffles all description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>For a distance, roughly guessed, of <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure>, the wall is little less than a steep hill that descends from the parapet to the water's edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>This, too, is a ghastly pile of the once magnificent shape, from which stand out, in almost sickening aspect, fragments of guns, gun carriages, masses of machinery, balls, bolts, rammers, spongers, all bound and mixed together with the iron, brick and mortar, in lumps and in dust, that have been wrenched from their long time honored places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Here, too, lie the myriad fragments of projectiles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> On the parapet, as you glance around the pleasant walk that has been the scene of so many social episodes, eagerly remembered by our fair ones, you observe that the demon of destruction has likewise laid his heavy hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/><num value="1">One</num> solitary gun, looming high above all else, keeps its lonely watch, and this has been partially covered by the dirt dashed over it in the passage of a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Of the interior of the fort we must intentionally preserve <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">silentium altum,</hi></foreign> <num value="1">One</num> significant fact, however, may be stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>There is not a serious breach in the structure anywhere to be observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The effect of the enemy's fire, though destructive, has tended to fortify the walls with their own <hi rend="italics">debris,</hi> so that while the efficiency of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> for offence is destroyed, the same means employed has improved its capacity for defence against every infantry assault that may be made against it. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> In connection with the recent assaults several incidents are worthy of mention.--The officers captured confessed themselves (to use their own expression) &#x0022;sold.&#x0022; They expected to find the place occupied by a dozen or <num value="20">twenty</num> men only, and the entrance easy.
