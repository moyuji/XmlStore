<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> I am not in favor of restoring the constitutional relations of slaveholders to the <rs>Union</rs>, nor of the war to that end. On the contrary, I am utterly and forever opposed to both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I am in favor of the <rs>Union</rs> as it exists to day. I am in favor of recognizing the loyal States as the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> nation, based as they are on the principle of freedom for all, without distinction of race, color, or condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I believe it to be the manifest destiny of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> nation to ultimately control the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent on this principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I conceive that, therefore, the true object of this war is to revolutionize the national Government by resolving the <rs>North</rs> into the nation and the <rs>South</rs> into a distinct public body, leaving us in a position to pursue the latter as a separate State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>I believe that the direction of war to any other end is a perversion of it, calculated to subvert the very object it was designed to effect. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> I have never allowed myself to indulge in that superstitious idolatry of the <rs>Union</rs> so prevalent among the simple but honest people, nor that political can't about the <rs>Union</rs> so prevalent among dishonest ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The war which has come in between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> for the past <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, has made a revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It has substituted in the <rs>South</rs> another Government for that of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>This is the fact and the fact in such a matter is the important thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It settles the law. No technicality in a question of this kind can stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The war has utterly dissolved the connection between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, and rendered them separate and independent powers in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This is the necessary legal effect of civil war anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It makes the belligerent parties independent for the time being, and unless the <num value="1">one</num> succumbs to the other, they continue independent of each other forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The principle is laid down by Vattel as follows: When a nation becomes divided into <num value="2">two</num> parties, absolutely independent, and no longer acknowledging a common superior, the <rs>State</rs> is dissolved, and the war between the <num value="2">two</num> parties stands upon the same ground in every respect as a public war between <num value="2">two</num> different nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Such a suggestion, in their eyes is a proposition to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>--for which <num value="1">one</num> ought to be hanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They expect the question whether the <rs>Union</rs> shall be restored by force or by compromise to be submitted to the people in the next election, and upon that to carry the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Their plan is to oppose the <name>Administration</name> simply on its anti slavery policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They put in issue the confiscation act, the <rs>Missouri</rs> emancipation act the <rs>President</rs>'s proclamation of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>These measures they pronounce unconstitutional, deny the validity and everything done, or to be done, in pursuance of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>In addition to this, they attack the <name>Administration</name> on account of its suspension of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> false imprisonments, corruption, imbecility, &#x0026;c, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Such a host may well feel confident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It is a combination for victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The elements have been well-shaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Not in vain have the border State politicians through the hall of the <name>Presidential</name> mansion &mdash; Not in vain has the discreet <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> incurred the reputation of having become imbecile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Not in vain has the whole Administration suffered the odium of drafting with the tide for lack of a policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>They could well afford to dispense with the applause of the radicals, while they silently directed that under-current which was to refer the gigantic questions with which they would not grapple to the decision of another Presidential election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The conservatives will triumph. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The chief element in the accomplishment of this reactionary movement is the war which the <name>Administration</name> is conducting for the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The war is, indeed, the trump card of the <name>Democracy</name> &mdash; not war for conquest, but <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s war for the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.--They have no fear it will serve the end of Abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It has passed that stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Its results are now in their keeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>All they wish is its prolongation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>In the first place, it holds the nation pledged to the principle that the <rs>Union</rs> is intact and the <rs>Constitution</rs> open to amendment through Southern votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In the next place, the responsibility of it, being the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, it weakens them sadly in the elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>And in the third place, it is to wear away and depress the slaveholders, and dispose them in favor of conciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The war, in whatever aspect it may be presented, is an admirable instrument for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>If it should happen to meet with unexpected success, and defeat the rebellion, the slaveholders will be brought back just in time to join them in the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>If it should lag and accomplish no results, as now seems likely, this will inevitably insure them a triumph in the popular vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Their theory is &mdash; and it is a sound ore &mdash; the <num value="2">two</num> forces &mdash; Abolition and Secession &mdash; now in deadly conflict, have only to be permitted to continue the fight long enough to wear each other out, and cause the political waters to subside to their former level. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Great reliance is placed by the latter on the vote of the soldier; but, in my opinion, this is delusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The soldiers will be affected in like manner with the rest of the people and, moreover, will be tired of military service, and anxious to return home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>This is an egregious mistake.--The proclamation will have no such effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>It cannot have any such effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>This fact, however, offers no obstacle whatever to such a separation as is involved in independent political jurisdiction; on the contrary, it greatly facilitates it.
