<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> In the first place we are told that the rebels spiked the guns belonging to the <name>Zouaves</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>I can confidently assert that the <name>Zouaves</name> had no guns that could be spiked by anybody, unless, perhaps, they were miserable old <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pounders that had been pitched outside of <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName> for imperfections, and were occasionally used for drill purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Then we are told that the roads or approaches to the fort from <persName n="Wilson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Billy,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s camp were hilly and abundant in chaparral, or bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Those bushes were cut down weeks ago to make camp fires of, and to shade the wretched little tents in which the <name>Zouaves</name> were quartered to be made mince meat of by the mosquitoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The dispatch also speaks of other roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Properly speaking, there are no roads on the island, if we except a few pathways made of planks carried down in the <rs>Vanderbilt</rs> steamer in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> last, and barely sufficient to meet the commonest requirements of camp life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>In walking about this island <num value="1">one</num> has a very lively idea as to the beauties of a journey through a series of excessively soft snowdrifts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>How an invading force could &#x0022;drive in&#x0022; local pickets under such circumstances is to me &mdash; who knows every inch of the ground &mdash; rather incomprehensible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Those pickets were comprised of men who would scarcely allow a hostile landing without fighting their ground by the inch, and giving warning to a nest of military hornets that would &mdash; on sand banks they are thoroughly familiar with &mdash; conquer <num value="3">three</num> times their number of raw assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The island, where <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Billy,,,"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s men are encamped, is very little more than <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/><num value="1">One</num> side of the camp (facing the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>) is strongly protected by the blockading fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>That a skirmish has taken place on that sand bank called <placeName reg="Santa Rosa, Sonoma, California" key="tgn,2014133">Santa Rosa</placeName> is not to be denied, and that when it did take place, <persName n="Brown,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Brown,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> allowed the poor fellows, cruelly deprived of the hospitality of his fort, to make the best of their prowess without &#x0022;regular&#x0022; aid, is also quite plain to me; but I do not believe that &#x0022;the boys&#x0022; were flogged, nor can I &mdash; being in constant communication with several of the prominent officers of the regiment &mdash; imagine that the rebels took either many lives or many prisoners. </p> </q><bibl n="A correspondent of the New York Herald"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Now he had not above half that number, and the streets, though not so thronged as usual, still showed a considerable population, of which the tyrannical authorities made a free use to increase their forces up to the last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>For some days <persName n="Mosquero,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Mosquero,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Mosquero</surname></persName> had fixed his headquarters at El Arzobispo, a small stream which crosses the northern suburb of the city, and the centralist army was posted at the extremity of the town, at <placeName reg="San Diego, San Diego, California" key="tgn,7014455">San Diego</placeName>, their position being formed by the convent of that name, some enclosures belonging to the same, the high walls of which they had loopholed, a parapet made by the troops up the slope of the foot of the mountain, called Monserrate, and a similar <num value="1">one</num> across the road leading towards the north, that is to Mosquero's position the <rs>Puente del Comun</rs>, Cepaquira, &#x0026;c.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> The General determined to attack the entrenchments of the enemy, and to be certain of the triumph there before the other divisions should enter the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>At least the battle raged around <placeName reg="San Diego, San Diego, California" key="tgn,7014455">San Diego</placeName> from early morning till past noon, when the attacking forces had completely gained the day, and those which had been posted to the <rs>South</rs> entered and took the principal square after the exchange of a few shots.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> In the meantime, those who had taken the public square, close to which is the entrance to the common jail, lost no time in setting free the innocent victims whom the fallen Government had cooped up there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Here, again, it is a pleasant duty to record the moderation of these suffering individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>No sooner did it become evident that the attacking force must gain the day, than the numerous guard, which was constantly kept mixed up with the prisoners, at the order of their commander, delivered their arms to <persName n="Bradilla,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Bradilla,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bradilla</surname></persName>, the legitimate <rs>President</rs> of Santander, as the person most proper to assume authority over the prisoners, mostly from his State. --The most influential of these gentlemen calmed and restrained <num value="1">one</num> single individual of their number, who, exasperated at the long series of insults and ill treatment he had received at the hands of the wretch whom the fallen Government had made jailor, notwithstanding, or perhaps the rather, that he was a convicted murderer, wished to retaliate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> In the public square the firing soon ceased, and immediately after the bells of the different churches began a merry peal to announce the close of the reign of terror, and the beginning of a new era of peace, liberty, and prosperity. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> There is evidently trouble ahead in this regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>It will arise from <num value="2">two</num> sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> the want of means to carry on the stupendous struggle in which we are engaged: and, secondly, the diminution of confidence that will ere long be apparent, in our paper issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Not that the banks will be unable to supply a large circulating medium, for in their present condition of immunity from the obligation to pay specie, they can &#x0022;float&#x0022; their paper extensively, and be of great service to the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>With a very remote prospect of being called upon to resume the redemption of their paper, they would be inexcusable were they to contract their operations and thereby increase the public distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Whilst the disposition is general in the business community, out of abundant caution, to proceed upon a cash basis, the <rs>Government</rs>, and private operators on a large scale, must push the credit system further than ever.--It is useless, in this condition of affairs, to dream of conducting the business of the country upon a cash basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It cannot be done.--As before intimated, the banks being freed from the apprehension of &#x0022;a run,&#x0022; find no impediment in the way of affording the largest accommodation to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>And yet, from this very source, some difficulty may arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The conviction, if it should become general, that the banks are doing too much, and dealing in over-issues, would at once be fatal to their standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>We have seen this exemplified in some sort, in the case of the <orgName n="Pittsylvania Bank" type="bank">Bank of Pittsylvania</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>A belief is prevalent &mdash; we do not say it is well founded &mdash; that bank had issued more paper than its specie deposits would justify; and it is therefore impossible to restore its credit or &#x0022;float&#x0022; its paper freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The same fate would a wait any other bank in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, if the impression should obtain that it was over-issuing.--Hence, whilst it is the interest of the banks to retain their customers &mdash; we might add <hi rend="italics">sustain</hi> them in this season of depression, when property has only a nominal or fictitious value &mdash; and to keep all their own paper in circulation, it is equally necessary that they suffer not the taint of suspicion to attach to their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They are restrained, therefore, from inflating their currency unduly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>It has been proposed, with a view to meeting the extraordinary demands that are upon the country, to invest the banks with authority to increase their issues; and in this proposition, we doubt not, the stockholders in all those institutions would cordially concur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>It would be a bonus which no man who values the opportunity of increasing his wealth, would ignore or decline. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> But would this be the best arrangement for the people, who are to be heavily burdened with taxes to support the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Whilst it would give them a currency which they will much need, we cannot assume that it would be the best or safest currency that could be provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>There are strong reasons why the <rs>Government</rs>, which must proceed upon credit in some form or other, should afford us the currency we need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Independently of the fact that a currency which would be of uniform value in all parts of the country is to be preferred to <num value="1">one</num> that has differing values in different sections of the land, the tax payers should have the full benefit of these paper issues. </p> 
<p>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> --The most imposing naval armament ever witnessed from our shores was certainly that, which made a temporary rendezvous the other day in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, and sailed out to sea with the northwestern gale that blew so briskly on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The <hi rend="italics">invincible armada</hi> sent out by <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> against <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> numbered <num value="130">one hundred and thirty</num> vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>This of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> scarcely falls short of that in the number of vessels, and considerably exceeds it in tonnage and in weight of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Notwithstanding, however, the number of vessels it embraced, and the reported <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men on board, with a regiment of cavalry, we cannot see any reason for serious apprehension from its expected performances on our Southern seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Of all armaments and expeditions fitted out on a grand scale, naval ones are those most liable to accident, disaster, and failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They are the ones which most frequently come to grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>In addition to having to encounter all the mishaps and calamities to which land armies are liable, they have also those of the winds and floods to brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Single ships, or very small fleets, generally do well; but naval expeditions on a large scale generally turn out stupendous failures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>They are also much more expensive than land expeditions, and <num value="10">ten</num> fold more unmanageable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>If an expedition of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> balloons were sent forth from the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> against the <rs>South</rs>, loaded with men, guns, and munitions, the demonstration would be scarcely less alarming to the <rs>South</rs> than this <num value="1">one</num> of a <num value="100">hundred</num> ships sent out to encounter the storms of the <rs type="place">Carolina coast</rs>; and it is not probable that the enemy would be less boastful in advance of the &#x0022;terrible&#x0022; achievements for which it was destined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> If the expedition go to New Orleans it will have to encounter <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men ensconced behind formidable entrenchments and batteries, and supported by innumerable river craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>If it go to <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, there too <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men stand eager to welcome them with bloody hands to hospitable graves in a country strongly fortified by nature, and amply defended by works of art. A descent upon the <rs type="place">Florida coast</rs> would be a descent upon everglades, swamps, alligators, and canebrakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>They may readily capture a territory as sparsely inhabited as that is; but, as they would be able to reach little of its wealth and to impose their temporary authority upon but few of its people, such a conquest would poorly compensate so costly an expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It would be the mountain bringing forth the mouse again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> is strongly guarded by the troops provided by its energetic Governor who is ready and able to concentrate <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men at any point at less than <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is not only protected by that wholesome dread which she has inspired in the bosom of every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, but by the thorough preparation which she has made to receive all excursionists from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It will require many more than <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men to take <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, or to hold any other of the few points on the coast of the <rs>State</rs>, at which that number may succeed in disembarking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>From the peculiar character and conformation of the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> coast, it may not be practicable to prevent a descent upon some portion of it, but there is no point of the country <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> from the shore where at least <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> troops cannot be brought to bear against an invading force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Our various forts along the seaboard of that State are in a good state of efficiency; and will certainly be able to hold the enemy in check sufficiently long to give general notice of his whereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Indeed when we consider the preparations made in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to receive the expedition, and the force we have at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> is the district in which, at the shortest notice, we can collect the strongest force for resistance and it will be a subject of congratulation if the expedition should make its descent upon that State, which, besides the advantage of its central position, has probably more troops of its own than any of those threatened by the expedition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> Upon a survey of the whole field, therefore, we are not inclined to apprehend any &#x0022;terrible&#x0022; results from this boasted naval expedition of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It is likely to test how vulnerable the <rs>South</rs> is from the sea; and we think the failure which must sooner or later over take it, is likely to add more to our reputation for invincibility than it can detract from it, and thus prove more serviceable to us than hurtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>As <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> escaped injury from the <rs>Spanish Armada</rs>, so we think the probabilities are altogether on the side of the <rs>South</rs>'s escaping this threatened expedition without many broken bones. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The insolence of the prisoners is very natural, and what was to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The rebels had taken <placeName reg="Ohio Hill, Amador, California" key="tgn,2555771">Ohio Hill</placeName>, and were coming this way. <persName n="Ratcliff,,John,T.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="default:Ratcliff,John,T.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Ratcliff</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pogue,,Henry,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="default:Pogue,Henry,R.,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Pogue</surname></persName> went up what is called <persName n="Triplett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Triplett,nomatch:0"><surname>Triplett</surname></persName> and stopped all night at <persName n="Morehead,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Morehead,nomatch:0"><surname>Morehead</surname></persName> with <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> men, on their way to a secesh camp at Prestonsburg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>They say there is about <num value="4000">four thousand</num> there, and <num value="2000">two thousand</num> at Pike. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/> The supposition here is that they are getting a very heavy force, and intend to clean out <persName n="Grayson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Grayson,nomatch:0"><surname>Grayson</surname></persName> and this place, as they are determined to have revenge for taking them prisoners and killing the <num value="2">two</num> at <placeName key="tgn,2039145" n="1.000 2" reg="grayson, carter, kentucky">Grayson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>I think the best thing that could be done would be to form a camp at <placeName key="tgn,2039145" n="1.000 2" reg="grayson, carter, kentucky">Grayson</placeName>, as the whole upper end of this State is pretty well thinned out of men, and the secesh are recruiting from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and also from the lower end of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>; so, they are collecting a very heavy force, and there is something that will be done soon &mdash; where, we do not know. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>And the best thing that <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName> could do would be to help get up a camp somewhere in the upper end of this State, as it would be a great protection for her, for, if they should clean out this place and <persName n="Grayson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Grayson,nomatch:0"><surname>Grayson</surname></persName>, they would have a clean sweep for her. </p>

<head>How to Promote the health of the soldiers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch.</hi>--There are many things in the army so exceedingly misunderstood by gentlemen who know nothing about the practical workings of camp life, that it is no wonder editors and writers sometimes blame officers where no blame can be attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>The editor of <num value="1">one</num> of your dailies whose <persName n="Argus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00375" reg="mostcommon:Argus,nomatch:0"><surname>Argus</surname></persName> eye is looking everywhere, spies out, among others, the followers of <unclear>Esculspits,</unclear> and fancies that they are the authors of the terrible scourges that <unclear>afflect</unclear> our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>The writer of this knows nothing of the facts alluded to, but he has known sufficient of camp life and the transportation of sick soldiers, to be convinced that all the wisdom of the profession cannot correct many causes of sickness and suffering in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>The means to do so must come from officials, who neither know anything about the hygiene of camps, or the propriety of affording all possible means to avoid disease and mitigate the suffering of the sick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/> The port to be occupied is often a military necessity, and Its location often interferes with the health of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>The army in many instances is badly provided with tents and clothing, but especially in regard to sleeping and eating, are to be found sources of disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Soldiers are stowed away on the damp ground, with straw to sleep on, and food so badly prepared that it is a wonder that they can sleep under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>No language can be strong enough to denounce the use of straw in the tents of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>It is a great <unclear>uis nce,</unclear> and a needless expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>It is a source of disease, and will kill the very swine which sleeps in it. <persName n="Wheat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="mostcommon:Wheat,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheat</surname></persName> straw is almost university mixed with the <hi rend="italics"><unclear>fuagt</unclear> </hi> that so annoy the agriculturalist.--&#x0022;Smut&#x0022; and &#x0022;rust&#x0022; are undoubted sources of disease; and the <hi rend="italics"><unclear>serale comatum</unclear> </hi> of the rye must <unclear>be equally</unclear> so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/> Typhoid fever, the plague of camps this summer, is certainly promoted by this cause, and the dampness which the straw imbibes, either before or after it reaches the camps, with the length of time it is suffered to remain in the tents, are sources of bronchitis and pneumonia, which have been such distressing complications of typhoid fever in the army during the season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>It would be far better for our soldiers to sleep upon planks, elevated above the ground, with a fire in front of their tents, than be huddled together in damp, decaying straw, filled with disease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/> In the construction of camps, sufficient space is not allowed for the tents, and the ground is not cleared off, the grass and weeds are not destroyed, and the place on which the tent is to be located is not burned with brush or wood before the tent is pitched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>All these are sources of disease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/> I visited a camp in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> recently that struck me as a perfect model in every particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>It certainly reflects great credit upon the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>The men were as clean as though they were going to church.--The ground was laid off with mathematical accuracy; no vegetable matter was to be seen upon the earth, or anything left to decay, and the drill grounds looked as though they had been spaded, raked over, properly graded, and made smooth with a heavy roller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Drains at right angles were cut to carry away the water, and everything bore evidence of neatness, <hi rend="italics">cleanliness,</hi> and cheerfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>The surgeon of that regiment is a gentleman of great experience, and from the small size of his hospital, and the little to do in his dispensary, I judged he had little to do in attending the sick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/> In regard to food, our soldiers are not so badly provisioned as they are in want of cooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>In the army we may say, with truth, &#x0022;The <rs>Lord</rs> sends meat; but the <name>Devil</name> sends cooks. &#x0022; <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> ransacked <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> for cooks for his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>He knew that if the food of his men was properly prepared, he would have more space for the wounded and less demand upon medical purveyors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>I have seen but very little attention paid to this subject by our officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>It is said that <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00379" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> once undertook to learn some of his men how to prepare their food &mdash; and it showed how much he had the interest of his soldiers at heart &mdash; but I never heard how he succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>I have seen bread baked and meat cooked in our camps that the stomach of an ostrich would not digest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>We need a professor of the culinary art, with portable cooking apparatus, such as turned up among the <rs>English</rs> and <rs>French</rs> in the <name>Crimean</name> war, or some spirit of the kitchen to arouse our authorities upon this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/> The mode of sleeping, eating, the construction of camps, and other matters of interest which we could name, are subjects of deep interest to the army, but they seem to be beyond the control of the surgeon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/> Everything should be done in camp life to produce contentment, every source of innocent amusement and <unclear>mainly</unclear> enjoyment resorted to and the heart of every patriot should be cheered by every means while he awaits the foe, that <hi rend="italics"><unclear> </unclear></hi> and distrust may not prey upon his energies and lay him liable to disease.
