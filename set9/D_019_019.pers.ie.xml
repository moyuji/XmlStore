<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He does not think <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election justifies dissolution, though he views it as an abuse of power by the stronger section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He concludes: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Congress may do much to relieve the existing pressure, and great solicitude is felt to know the action of your committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The suggested change in the fugitive slave law possibly may prove satisfactory, and if with that change the offensive liberty bills be repealed, that cause of quarrel will be removed, but the change in the territorial policy must be more radical: it will not be sufficient merely to inaugurate the doctrine of squatter sovereignty by legislative enactment or constitutional amendments: for the reasons already given the territorial policy must be founded upon <hi rend="italics">equality</hi> and <hi rend="italics">justice.</hi> I have never apprehended any interference with the slave trade between the <name>States</name>, or with slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> so long as <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> recognize that species of labor, because such interference would be certain to encounter determined resistance, even to the overthrow of the <rs>Government</rs>.-- Nevertheless adequate assurances may be given on those points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But still if we are to have a friendly settlement of the distracting controversy, if we are to retrieve all past estrangements and enmities, and return to the ancient feeling of brotherhood between the people of the <num value="2">two</num> sections, much will remain for the <name>States</name> to do. They must bring back their legislation to the principles that governed it in the purer days of the country, when <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> protected <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> before <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> in the service of his body servant, and New York and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> protected Southern members of Congress with their families and attendants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> I concur in the suggestion of extending the duration of the <rs type="place">Presidential office</rs>, and confining the incumbent to a single term, but the proposition of the <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote for the acquisition of territory may be suspended by the policy already indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I agree with you that Conventions are dangerous bodies, but in times of danger and revolution we must deal with dangerous and revolutionary instruments; there is now, I think, no escape from the hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the <rs>Convention</rs> of this State, I hope for moderate and dispassionate, but firm action; for underlying all this excitement there is among our people a strong current of conservatism, and hereditary attachment to the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and a clear perception of the great interests at stake. --Doubtless we have many of extreme opinions and inclined to precipitate counsels; these are the minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But in any event, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> must share the fate of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, for they are bound together by too many geographical and artificial ties to admit of separation, and the same is true of all the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>What we want is a settlement of the slavery question, a final settlement, that shall banish it forever as a political issue, a settlement upon terms of perfect equality; with nothing less can we be satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We understand the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> to be committed to the use of the <rs>Federal</rs> power to prevent the extension of slavery to the new States, and to prevent the acquisition hereafter of more slave territory under any and all circumstances.--To this we will never submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The free States demand room for the expansion of their superabundant population, and it is reasonable that they should have it.--The increase of the slave population in the present slaveholding States will demand more room for them, and it is just that we should have it. This necessity may be, and probably is, remote, but when it arise it must be met by a suitable policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If these demands can be obtained in the <rs>Union</rs>, we are content to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>: if not, we will seek them out of it. The peace, the safety, and the prosperity of <num value="15">fifteen</num> States out of the <num value="33">thirty-three</num> that compose the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, depend upon the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>These are vital interests, and must be respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>If, upon considerations of a Northern sentiment and feeling against slavery, we permit them to be ignored by the common Government, how long will it be before, upon some other fancied conflict, the same power will be directed against some other great interest of the <rs>Southern States</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The disposition of the <rs>Northern</rs> majorities to deal unjustly with what we regard as the greatest industrial interest of the <rs>South</rs>, while it unites all opinions in the necessity of a reformation of the fundamental law in that respect, may give occasion to consider the further necessity of so changing that law as to arm the <rs>Southern</rs> section with the power of self-protection against aggression upon all other interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But these questions will be considered in our separate State Conventions, and the whole be definitely agreed in a <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">general Convention</orgName> of all the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Nothing will be demanded, I trust, for our section but what justice and necessary protection require, and what can be honorably and safely yielded by the other section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We shall claim no power of aggression, but simply security against the aggressions of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Let the <rs>North</rs> consider fairly what the <rs>South</rs> demands, and yield freely what is right; by so doing we will recover what has been lost in the past, and lay up for the future a store of good feeling between the sections, and of brotherhood that will make our union perpetual. </p> <closer> <salute>Very truly, yours,</salute><signed><persName n="Scott,,R.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="expanded:Scott,Robert,E.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName>  <surname>Scott</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4>

He did not deem it necessary to leave the place in consequence of the new state of affairs, but remained as before, with all but his actual authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>He thought a reaction was already taking place, which would render all such resolves out of place &mdash; the people of the great Northwest were already rising in their might and would cut out the politicians, when all matters of difference between the sections could be amicably and fairly adjusted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We never get over the lessons we imbibe from servants, who are our earliest instructors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Our reason tells us, for instance, that ghosts do not rise from the grave for the pleasure of sauntering about church-yards of dark nights; yet few men would volunteer to pass a night in a church-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>We know that <name>Friday</name> is as good a day to begin a journey or to commence an undertaking as any other.--Yet we have seen very many persons, of sound discretion, who would prefer any other day of the week for such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Our reason tells us that stepping over a fishing pole does not entail upon it bad luck for the day; yet we have seen many a fisherman whom it annoyed very much to step over his pole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>We feel assured that it bodes no ill luck to turn back after having commenced a journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Nevertheless, we confess to a very considerable repugnance on that score, arising entirely from the teachings of the nursery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>So with regard to good and bad luck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>We have seen many a man who was very desirous to dream about the numbers of lottery tickets; we have known several who purchased in consequence of dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Others again select particular persons to purchase tickets for them under the impression that they are lucky men. All this is superstition; reason tells us it is so.--But in spite of reason it will cling to us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> Of all the classes of superstition, presentiments are the hardest to eradicate, and the least within the reach of the judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Men have a presentiment that they shall die of a disease very trifling in the beginning, and when they take up that notion they are rarely ever false prophets.

He felt no uneasiness upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It made him none the less cheerful or attentive to business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>His friends used sometimes to rally him on the subject, but it was always <num value="1">one</num> on which he was not disposed to jest.
