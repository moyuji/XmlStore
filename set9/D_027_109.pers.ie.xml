<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There was no fighting on the lines below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Thursday in <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has permitted to pass without a &#x0022;reconnaissance in force.&#x0022; Perhaps the weather disconcerted his usual weekly arrangements; or, what is more likely, the result of his last so-called reconnaissance was so disastrous to his army as to make it necessary for him to pause longer between his blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>However that may be, he was quiet &mdash; uncommonly quiet &mdash; yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Not a gun was fired north of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and very few on the lines at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The positions usually swarming with blue-jackets in fine weather were tenanted yesterday only by solitary sentinels, who, wet and comfortless, hugged their shoddy great-coats closely as they trod their lonely rounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officer who came out to the picket line in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, yesterday morning, remarked to <num value="1">one</num> of our officers that our men were having a very quiet time just now, but that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would wake them up as soon as they (the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>) had completed certain little mortar arrangements on which they were at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They would, he said, make <placeName reg="Elliott Hill, Chattahoochee, Georgia" key="tgn,2315400">Elliott Hill</placeName> (our position immediately in front of, and nearest to, <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>) too hot to hold our fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We have not learned that this boast created any considerable excitement amongst our men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> It is reported that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has transferred some of his troops from the north to the south side, and certain creaking and rattling of his pontoons during the past few nights gives slight confirmation to the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is quite probable that, having failed to take the &#x0022;objective point&#x0022;--the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside railroad</orgName>--with the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 2">Second</orgName>, <orgName type="corps" n="corps 5">Fifth</orgName> and <orgName type="corps" n="corps 9">Ninth corps</orgName>, he purposes making another attempt upon it at an early day, aided by the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 10">Tenth corps</orgName>, and that, for that service, he has drawn that corps over to him. We believe he has moved the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 10">Tenth corps</orgName>, if any; because we know that parts, at least, of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">Eighteenth</num>--his only other force on the north side &mdash; are still in the trenches at and near <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> A gentleman who came in from the lines late last evening reports that the enemy has reduced his force in our front between <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> and the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If this observation is correct, it is further confirmatory of the reported withdrawal of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to the south side; but, possibly, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were not visible because they were sheltering themselves from the rain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The election is close at hand, and it will surprise no <num value="1">one</num> if <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> gives us another contest for the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside railroad</orgName>; it will rather surprise us if he does not. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> All was quiet on the lines around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>There is some activity manifested among the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, but from what cause is not known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But from the fact that it is generally believed by our generals on the north side that the enemy have decreased their force to a considerable degree, and that <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> is only held by a strong garrison, it is supposed that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is preparing for a grand blow elsewhere. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> It is now a well-ascertained fact that the detachment of Federals lately sent from the vicinity of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> were destined for <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> For several hours, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, a brisk shelling was kept up on our left centre &mdash; most of the cannonading proceeding from our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The main armies are quiet, grimly watching each other from unfriendly picket lines; the videttes greet each other daily, at the grey of the morning, with the whistling of a bullet; and there is throughout that army a general antipathy to conference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Our cavalry are beginning to somewhat change the tide of affairs, and are driving the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> horsemen from pillar to post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>A lack of sufficient watchfulness on the part of our troops seems to have been the prime cause of the loss of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It seems that, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, a party of <num value="18">eighteen</num> men, belonging to the blockading fleet in <placeName reg="Bluff Point, Chowan, North Carolina" key="tgn,2183504">Albemarle sound</placeName>, some <num value="8">eight</num> or <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName></placeName>, took a small torpedo boat and started for <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Then proceeding to <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>, they found the <rs>Albemarle</rs> at the wharf, and running the torpedo boat under her, Amidships, blow her up, causing damages from which she seen sunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> The military authorities have nothing to do with elections, and have no authority or right, as officers or soldiers, to interfere therewith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>At elections, all are citizens &mdash; none are soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Citizenship is the highest status of the man. The soldier is but a citizen employed in the military service &mdash; not in the civil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The duty of the soldier is to support &mdash; not to overthrow or control &mdash; the civil authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>He is to establish the civil authority where it has been overborne by revolt &mdash; not to overrule or usurp civil authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> If, therefore, any military officer shall show-himself so regardless of duty as to assume to direct or control the officers of election, you should treat such orders with indignant contempt, and scorn obedience which implies perjury and cowardice in you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> If military force is brought to menace the officers of election or voters, your duty is clearly marked out by law. The law is as binding upon the soldier as upon any other citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>He has no more right to violate it, and is as amenable to its penalties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>As no officer of any rank, from the <rs>President</rs> down, has any right or authority to interfere with elections, no order to do so can legalize the act. If there be sufficient power in the citizens present at any place where such interference may be attempted to arrest the offenders, and hold them over to answer to the violated laws, it will be the duty of the sheriff to make the arrest in such case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>He has authority to require the aid of every citizen, and it should be readily and promptly given in defence of a common right &mdash; of a blood-bought franchise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>If the force employed to interfere with the election be too great, at any place of voting, to be arrested, the officers of election in such case should adjourn, and not proceed with the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>If you are unable to hold a free election, your duty is to hold none at all, but adjourn and report the offenders to the grand jury of your county for indictment and punishment.--This is the lawful mode of meeting unlawful attempts to disturb the freedom of elections. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> On the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most magnificent bazaars ever held in the north of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was opened at the <rs type="place">St. George's Hall</rs>, in <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, in aid of the &#x0022;Southern Prisoners' Relief Fund.&#x0022;--For nearly <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> the preparations have been in progress, and during that time contributions the most valuable have flowed in from all parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>So numerous, indeed, are the articles thus generously given, that the difficulty has not been to &#x0022;dress&#x0022; the stalls, in the technical sense of the word, but to exhibit all that they contain; for a bazaar on so sumptuous and vast a scale as this <num value="1">one</num>, is dwarfed even in the magnificent hall devoted to it. The <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> thus describes the scene: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The stalls, of which there are <num value="12">twelve</num>, named after the <rs>Southern States</rs>, are ranged down the sides of the hall, <num value="5">five</num> on each side, and the remaining <num value="2">two</num> form a large central tent, from the apex of which rises a triplet of tri-colored flags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Tri-colored drapery also roofs the stalls, and it being of bunting instead of the ordinary glazed calico, gives a peculiar soft and rich appearance, and heightens the effectiveness of the harmonious color contrasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The stalls are alternately square and octagonal in shapes, the octagons having tent or spiral roofs rising to a point, and capped with the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag; and the square ones, sloping roofs, reaching about half way up to the gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The counters are all covered with crimson cloth, and a drapery valiance, which runs round the top of each stall, forms a very graceful cornice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The valiance itself is elaborately decorated with a blue margin and a prettily-designed <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> centre, and above the top margin is a neat border, terminating in a tri-colored cord, which runs from stall to stall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The panelings at the bottom of the stalls are of white drapery, relieved by blue; and the panels themselves, <unclear></unclear> by gold beading, and <unclear>uted </unclear> at the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>At the south end of the hall, and in the middle of the floor, is the <unclear>aution</unclear> stand, an octagonally-shaped platform, which is to be at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appropriated for the larger and heavier articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It, too, is wrapped in crimson, and bears ingeniously-designed combinations of colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The panels are fluted and have gold mouldings, and the centre is studded with <rs type="color">blue</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> rosettes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The central tent, to which we have already referred as the largest, is also the most complete; <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of it forms the <rs>Kentucky</rs> stall, presided over by the <rs>Lady De Hoghton</rs> and <persName n="Oliver,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="nearbymention:Oliver,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Oliver</surname></persName>, and the other half of the <rs>Tennessee</rs> stall, at which the <rs>Lady M.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Thus at the apex of each of the bell-roofed sectional octagon tents are small triplets &mdash; a tri-colored of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> being in the centre, and the <rs>English</rs> and <rs>French</rs> flags on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>At the stall named &#x0022;<placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>,&#x0022; which is the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> on the left-hand side, the flag of the <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Georgia</rs> is exhibited; and it may be interesting to mention that this same stall is presided over by <persName n="Bullock,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Bullock</surname></persName>, the wife of <persName n="Bullock,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bullock</surname></persName>, of the famous man-of-war.
