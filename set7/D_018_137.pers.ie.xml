<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> Within the past year some very remarkable enterprises have been undertaken in this city, which have been from time to time noticed in this paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/><num value="1">One</num> which has very recently gone into operation is the <hi rend="smallcaps">Sugar Refinery,</hi> built by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Morriss,Captain,Charles,Y.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="default:Morriss,Charles,Y.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName n="Charles">Chas.</foreName> <foreName>Y.</foreName> <surname>Morriss</surname></persName>,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of our most public spirited as well as enterprising citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The project is his own in every respect, and has been completed and put into active and, we doubt not, successful operation by his own means and active energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The establishment is planned on a large scale, and with a view to yet further extension, as the demands of trade may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The <rs n="refined sugar" type="product">refined sugars</rs> already turned out by it give the most perfect satisfaction, and are surpassed in quality by none in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We consider the owner of this manufactory a real public benefactor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>If a few more of our men of means would emulate his good example, this city would grow much more rapidly in wealth and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We commend the <rs>Richmond</rs> <rs n="refined sugar" type="product">refined sugars</rs> to the friends of home industry at the <rs>South</rs>, and trust that the manufacturer will find himself nobly sustained in his enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>He will certainly be so encouraged if there is any sincerity in Southern professions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> In the department of woolen manufactures there has been recently much done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Crenshaw Woolen Manufacturing Company</hi> commenced operations some time since, and has been throwing into market some admirable specimens of its fabrics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>We notice, especially, very superb shawls, blankets, and fine cassimere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Manchester Cotton and Woolen Manufactory</hi> has gone earnestly into the manufactory of coarse woolens for <rs n="servants' clothing" type="product">servants' clothing</rs>, which are much esteemed and in demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>These <num value="2">two</num> establishments are giving occupation to a great many hands, and in the matter of the trade and business of the city, are most valuable auxiliaries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> The <hi rend="smallcaps">Union Manufacturing Company</hi> is another large concern, which promises to be of great benefit to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>It manufactures <rs n="sewing machine" type="product">sewing machines</rs>, of approved and popular styles, in the most admirable manner, and at cheap prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It also makes <rs n="planing machine" type="product">planing machines</rs> of an improved pattern, and <rs n="steam engines" type="product">steam engines</rs>, and among the last named a style of small engine that is very useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>This establishment was <num value="1">one</num> of the effects of the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName></hi> raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>It was gotten up with a large capital &mdash; planned on a liberal scale, and has gone into operation with a great deal of spirit &mdash; and thus far with admirable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The company recently effected a favorable arrangement with <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Sloat,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Sloat,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sloat</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, who had matured a beautiful and excellent machine, and that gentleman has removed his entire force to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, adding it, and his own ingenuity and skill, and energy in business, to the previous means and capabilities of the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Thus we have an establishment of great capacity, and <num value="1">one</num> that is destined to contribute much to the growth of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, as well as Southern manufacturing independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> A new manufactory has been added to the list in our city, in the railroad car-spring manufactory, which recently commenced operations at the <rs>Tredegar Foundry</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>This manufactory makes those vulcanized <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> car-springs, which are so popular. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>These, with others that might be named, constitute a manufacturing power in various departments of <rs n="iron work" type="product">iron work</rs>, including all descriptions of railroad work, cannon and ball casting, &#x0026;c., of which we may be justly proud. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> The times are now oppressive, and our manufactories are suffering to some extent; but as soon as the troubles in which we are now involved pass by &mdash; whatever be their termination --this city will enter the field with a manufacturing energy and success that will astonish her warmest and most sanguine friends. </p> </div3>
