<head rend="italics">What will they do with us?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We fully concur with a contemporary that neither experience of the conduct of other nations where revolutions had occurred, nor our knowledge of the public enemy while we were in political association with him, nor since the rupture, afford any reason to expect that the consequences of our failure would be less disastrous nor deplorable to individuals, to property and to society, than have been the consequences of defeat, without exception, to vanquished peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>No more than <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, <placeName reg="Magyarorszag" key="tgn,7006278">Hungary</placeName> or <placeName reg="Polska" key="tgn,7006366">Poland</placeName>, may we hope for another fate than political subjection, with all the accompaniments of humiliation and wretchedness &mdash; the fate of subjugated national ties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We go even further than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We believe that the dispositions of <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName>, and of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>, are benevolent and merciful compared to those of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government to the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In none of these examples were so many base and cruel appetites enlisted as in this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is not alone the lust of power, the greed of gain, and the madness of fanaticism &mdash; added to all these are the devilish passions of envy and revenge, the infernal spirit of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>, combined with the ambition of the <name>Czar</name> and the fanaticism of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Neither <placeName reg="Magyarorszag" key="tgn,7006278">Hungary</placeName>, <placeName reg="Polska" key="tgn,7006366">Poland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, no <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName>, have ever suffered as this people will be made to suffer when the foot of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> tyrant is on the necks of the--&#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> families. &#x0022; That will be the sweetest draught &mdash; the conqueror will quaff in all that mingled goblet of blood and subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The utter degradation of those whom they represent as the aristocrats will be milk and honey to their souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It matters not that in no land under Heaven is there as much real republicanism as in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Our enemies are enraged by that decree of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which has assigned to the <rs>Southern</rs> people such a goodly heritage; they feel the malign influences which steal over ignoble natures when they come in contact with superior manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>What will they do with us, indeed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>What did Robespierre, St. Just and other demons of the <name>Reign</name> of Terror do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Even were they disposed to be tolerant and merciful, the necessities of their position would present difficulties which it would be impossible to surmount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Our own debt, State and Confederate, would be wholly repudiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The enormous debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <num value="3000">three thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars,--owed by the <rs>Northern</rs> people &mdash; owed to them &mdash; whose pockets will that come out of?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A contemporary, the <hi rend="italics">Confederate,</hi> supposes this case: <num value="2">Two</num> candidates in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States present themselves for popular suffrages for a seat in the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>. <num value="1">One</num> puts to the other this question: We have a debt of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and several <num value="1000000">millions</num> are held by our constituents &mdash; how do you propose to pay it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Well, says the other, the <rs>Southern</rs> people are our brethren &mdash; we are not of the same race and blood; it is true they have done very wrong, have committed grievous sins, but they have been sadly punished, and their sufferings are many and great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We can afford to be humane, and generous, and forgiving; our nation is great and prosperous; the debt will never be felt as a burden; I am for paying it as an ordinary public debt, by provisions made through Congress, bearing uniformly on the people of the whole Union, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>To which the questioner would reply: I care nothing for race or blood; these Southern people <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> were rebels, and they failed, and they have been admitted back into the <rs>Union</rs>; they caused the war; they shed the blood of Northern people; they produced the debt &mdash; it is little enough to make them pay it to the last farthing.--Which of these men would sit in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> So of pensions and bounties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When the war ends they will have the maimed and crippled soldiers on their hands, and the widows and orphans of those who died in their service &mdash; and they will be many, for their slaughter has been great, and their wounded and disabled immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> familiar with the history of pensions after the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution knows that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> appeared on the pension rolls of the <rs>Republic</rs> in numbers out of all proportion to their numbers on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In the present war the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> profess to have brought out, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of men. We do not believe <sic>that</sic> that number has existed anywhere except on the muster rolls; but if any <num value="1">one</num> doubts that it would be fully represented on the pension lists, he must be an indifferent reader of history.--These will have to be provided for by pensions and bounties. &#x0022;But out of whose property,&#x0022; asks the <hi rend="italics">Confederate,</hi> &#x0022;are those pensions and bounties to be supplied?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Never will the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation agree to fasten any portion of such a burden on themselves while we have shoulders on which they can put it.--There would be the same <num value="2">two</num> candidates for Congress &mdash; the same <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italics">con</hi>--and the same result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> &#x0022;But where are these bounty lands to be located?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There are <num value="1000000">millions</num> of acres of Northwestern lands, but they are wild forests and uncultivated prairies.--In the <rs>South</rs>, are farms still undesolated &mdash; rich, fertile lands, improved by cultivation, stocked with implements of husbandry,--with cattle and beasts of burden, with dwellings and necessary out-houses,--which lands have already been promised, and which are as coveted as they are desirable; and those who want them are they who will cast the votes that will elect the men who are to say whether or no they are to be given.--Can there be any doubt that the soldiers of our enemies will be quartered in their bounty lands on the plantations of our citizens? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> &#x0022;Besides, these lands grow the great staples, and the staple of cotton primarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It will be a political necessity with our enemies to place the cultivation of cotton in the keeping of themselves, and out of the hands of those who have been rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But while the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers are thus pensioned and supplied with his bounty land, what is to become of our own heroic soldiers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The few, but undismayed &mdash; the braves of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s noble army &mdash; the self-sacrificing, enduring veterans, who have planted so often the battle-flag of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> on the enemy's ramparts, amid the shouts of victory &mdash; of those whose limbs have been torn asunder, the blind and crippled, who cannot earn a support, and the wives and little ones, who have fallen in the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Why, in the day that our banners are lowered &mdash; in the day that our Confederacy is lost &mdash; the doom of our soldiers will be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They will be turned adritt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>No homage will be paid to their sufferings; no support in their afflictions and want!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Orphans of a dead nation, without an asylum or a friend!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> &#x0022;What will they do with us&#x0022; in the event of subjugation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Nothing in all the clouded future is as manifest and palpable as the answer to that question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Every man in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who expects to have a home upon the earth must fight for it, or, if he cannot fight, help by his industry and self-denial to feed those who are fighting. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head rend="italics">Croakers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> We cannot permit the race of croakers to pass away without a parting benediction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Among the darkest shadows are those which people conjure up from their own hypochondriacal spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Your genuine croaker is not as comfortable as he was before the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This is not the world he took it for. It is not a world of mutton chops, <name>English</name> ale and <num value="6">six</num> per cents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It is not a world in which a man can live till he is ready to die, and say to his soul: &#x0022;Eat, drink and be merry.&#x0022; The preachers had told him so till it became a bore, and now he considers <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> himself swindled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Those who think to retain arms for their own defence should remember that if the army cannot protect them the arms will be of little use.--While no valid title can be acquired to public arms and equipments, except from the <rs>Government</rs>, it is reported that many persons have ignorantly purchased them from private parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>All these officers are requested, and those connected with this army are directed, to receive and receipt for all arms and equipments, whatever their condition, and forward the same, with a duplicate receipt, to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 12" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and report their proceedings to these headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The person holding the receipt will be compensated upon presenting it to the <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> While it is hoped that no <num value="1">one</num> will disregard this appeal, all officers connected with this army are required, and all others are requested, to take possession of any public arms and equipments they may find in the hands of persons unwilling to surrender them to the service of the country, and to give receipt therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>A prompt compliance with the call will greatly promote the efficiency and strength of the army, particularly of the cavalry, and render it better able to protect the homes and property of the people from outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> &#x0022;I have submitted to the <rs>President</rs> the reflections upon the temper and disposition of the <rs>British</rs> nation as they are affected by our civil war, with which you have favored me. The correctness of your views is established by the fact that the insurgents manifestly have a bold, vigorous and effective party in both Houses of Parliament, and in the <rs>British</rs> press, which party is confessedly influential in the <orgName n="General Administration" type="misc">general administration</orgName> of public affairs, while the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> seem to have in the <rs>British Legislature</rs> and in the <rs>British</rs> press no advocates or defenders, except persons who, however great their ability and wealth, are nevertheless practically excluded from the conduct of national affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>There is, moreover, a marked habit prevailing in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> of comparing <name>British</name> resources and achievements with <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> resources and achievements, and this is done so unnecessarily, and often in a spirit so illiberal, as to indicate a sense of rivalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> &#x0022;Our civil war has endured for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. It has necessarily brought up many irritating and perplexing questions between the <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>I think it would be safe to say that no belligerent State ever bore itself more forbearing towards a neutral Power, whose subjects committed so many injuries and provocations, than we have done towards <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>I think it equally clear that no neutral Power was ever more unyielding and more exacting towards a belligerent than <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has been towards the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Your inference from this condition of things is that this Government must apply itself with the greatest possible energy to bring the civil war to a speedy and triumphant conclusion, or else it may have reason to expect conflict with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and with her allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>While, however, we accept this wise counsel, it would be unjust on my part towards the <name>Treasury</name>, War and Navy Departments, if I were to withhold the expression of a thorough and deliberate conviction that the war is conducted with all the energy and skill which any administration of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in their circumstances, could command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> &#x0022;The conflict is indeed a great <num value="1">one</num>, and the ideas and interests which sustain the parties engaged in it render it fierce and obstinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>We must, therefore, accept the case as it is &mdash; a case of severe domestic trial, with continual danger of foreign intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We have before us but <num value="1">one</num> line of duty &mdash; that is, the way of perseverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It is the course we have pursued hitherto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It will save us now, unless we are to be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>That this nation can be lost is a conclusion that neither our virtue nor our patriotism, nor even our reason, can accept. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> &#x0022;I will not say how great our confidence in the opening campaign is.--Events are so near that we can no more wisely wait for them than anticipate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Nor can we prudently forget that, of all human transactions, those of war are, in their sequences the most uncertain and capricious, although the ultimate results are a subject of political calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We have the conviction that the national cause is in a far stronger condition now than it has been at any previous stage of the civil war, while the disunion forces seem weaker than at any time heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The maritime Powers, whose interference is to be apprehended if we should be unfortunate, seem to me to be somewhat less at liberty to engage against us now than they have hitherto been. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> &#x0022;I think it certain that we have more friends and fewer enemies abroad now than we have had at former periods of the war. Thus time seems to be favoring us, and time is always the best friend of justice and truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Nor is it necessary to suppress the convictions that, pacific as the temper of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people is, yet that the efforts and sacrifices which they have hitherto made are inconsiderable compared with what they would make if now assailed by a foreign enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Practically there is no longer a hearing in the country for a man who counsels fear of the enemy at home; much less would there be a hearing for <num value="1">one</num> who should counsel submission to aggression from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>These are the grounds upon which the <rs>President</rs> builds his hope that we shall pass safely through the trials which are before us.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/> &#x0022;When Senor <persName><foreName>Donato</foreName></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presents himself, hopping on from the side scenes, no pleasurable emotion is felt; on the contrary, the immediate feeling rather partakes of the disagreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>To see a man in the very prime of life, with <num value="1">one</num> leg and stump without support, coming forward, smiling and proffering to do in a state of mutilation what few male dancers, perfect and whole, of the greatest art and experience, ever could do &mdash; namely, afford unqualified gratification &mdash; seems to shock <num value="1">one</num>'s delicacy, no less than mock his credulity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Senor <persName><foreName>Donato</foreName></persName>, however, enlists your sympathies pretty well before you have finished inspecting him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Nor when astonishment has passed off is your interest in Senor <persName><foreName>Donato</foreName></persName> exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>On the contrary, you see something to be pleased with in his performance every moment, until at last you acknowledge that he is not only <num value="1">one</num> of the most surprising dancers you ever beheld, but <num value="1">one</num> of the most engaging; and such is the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>A person may smile at hearing the word &#x0027;graceful&#x0027; used in speaking of a <num value="1">one</num> legged dancer, but if ever the term were applicable to a male Terpsichorean artist, it is to Senor <persName><foreName>Donato</foreName></persName>, whose motions, actions, gestures and general deportment are instinct with that natural ease and propriety which are the essentials of grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>In short, the fact of Senor <persName><foreName>Donato</foreName></persName> having but <num value="1">one</num> leg is soon forgotten by the spectators, and their sympathies are enchained in following his marvellous feats of agility and science; and these are by no means easy to describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>He accompanies the tune with the castanets, which he plays with more consummate skill than any <num value="1">one</num> we ever heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>This may be a trifle, but it is a great gain for him. His pirouettes are made with incomparable ease, and the dexterous manner in which he swings his body round, performing <num value="2">two</num> revolutions, is beyond all belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Among the most difficult feats he performs is placing a castanet on the ground with his right hand, at right angles to his body, and taking it up with his left hand <hi rend="italics">without bending his leg all the time.</hi> The practitioners in gymnastics will understand the difficulty of achieving this feat <hi rend="italics">standing on <num value="2">two</num> legs.</hi> That part of Senor <persName><foreName>Donato</foreName></persName>'s performance, however, which engages most attention and creates the greatest excitement, is the cloak dance.
