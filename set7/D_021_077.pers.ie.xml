<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It was not only extraordinary, but he doubted its patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was a contradiction of the avowed purpose of the party in power &mdash; a party which, He thanked <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, he had never belonged to, and it was certain that he never would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>That party, however, had declared here that it had no intention to interfere with the rights of the <name>States</name> of any section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Yet here was a measure of unmistakable interference, in violation of that pledge &mdash; proposing action in regard to a domestic institution of the slave States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Have they asked your aid?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>No. Then your proffer is indelicate, to say the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He related that during the late <unclear>s</unclear> of the <name>Legislature</name> of <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> a printed bill had found its way to that-body, proposing the issue of <measure n="300000dollars" type="currency">$300,000</measure> of bonds for emancipation in <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The measure was there scouted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>This bill, he had learned, had its origin in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He thought it at <unclear></unclear> well that Congress should wait to hear from the people of the slave States on this subject, before inaugurating measures &mdash; and coming as they do in this volunteer way, he could but regard them as part of the scheme for keeping alive the general and slavery agitation, and extend it into the border States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> This fall, in the election in <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, the list is sought to be made of emancipation, on the pretence that the <rs>General Government</rs> generously orders pecuniary aid. Thus the question of the abolition of slavery was to be intensified in the border slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> was to be given this inducement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Was not this an interference, not by direct but by indirect means ? On this idea, supposing the proposition to be sincere, the country would pleasant the spectacles of going into the whole sale negro business. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The proposition had been rejected once in his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He could force it directly to Federal authority, and yet here it was made to them a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He now in the name of his people again rejected it. When the people of <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> desired to lacerate the balance of the few slave they have, they will do it in their own way, in their own time, and at their own <unclear></unclear> They would ask no aid of the <rs>General Government</rs> or others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>With this proposition fairly before the people of <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> as the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> policy, the loyal men of that State--supposing they will be allowed the opportunity of a fair election &mdash; will sweep it on rely out of their borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The loyal men, he repeated, would do this; the <rs>Constitution</rs> loving men &mdash; for those only who support and uphold the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it is are loyal Those who attack it in such measures violative of its provisions as this, are not loyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. cited the language of the resolution &mdash; that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> &#x0022;ought&#x0022; to compensate, &#x0026;c.--as indefinite and not binding, and as allowing that the whole thing was intended as a delusion, and that the indemnity would never actually be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>If it was honestly latened, why should not the resolution declare, in express terms, that compensation will or shall be made ? He had no idea that it ever could be. The purpose was general emancipation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> With the immense burden of debt which this was will pile up, the people of the free States will never candent to the large additional imposition for this scheme of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He didn't believe that those who proposed it expected that they would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>As to the power of Congress to appropriate money in such a case the <orgName n="Judiciary Committee" type="committee">Judiciary Committee</orgName>, who recommended the passage of the resolution, and who are supposed to be learned in the law, had not enlightened them <unclear></unclear> regard to it, and no man of national reputation in the country had ever declared that Congress had such powers. </p>
