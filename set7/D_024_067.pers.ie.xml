<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> From the severity of the past winter we are led to conclude that the season for all crops will be a very favorable <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is true, not much wheat was put in the ground lest fall, owing to the long continued dry weather; but what there was planted will undoubtedly produce largely, giving nearly as much as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But what we will lack in wheat will be more than made up in the larger quantity of corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The farmers are preparing, in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> generally I believe, for planting as much corn as possibly can be attended to. Some of our oldest citizens and most experienced farmers say that they have never known it to fail that good crops would follow a snowy winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If there is any virtue in snow then we have been greatly blessed, for we have had <num value="21">twenty one</num> so far and it may be we shall have more, as we have not passed the equinox. --It snows are of great advantage, our crops will be surely superabundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I hope every farmer in the whole Confederacy may be impressed with the importance of pointing every grain of corn and every inch of ground they possibly early for, it ever there was a time when it was necessary to have corn, it will be at our next harvesting season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It is quite as necessary as to have powder or other munition of war, and those who engage in agriculture this year will be doing as much service to the country as if they were under arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The scarcity of hands, however, will be a great draw back, and it may be that a suspension of the <name>Conscription</name> law until after the harvest, in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, would not be impolite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>However, that is a matter for the consideration of those in authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The subject of impressments by military officers is attracting much attention, and there is no doubt that, as heretofore carried out, it has operated much to the injury of the <rs>Government</rs>, and has borne harshly upon portions of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>If the <rs>Congress</rs> will declare there shall be no more impressments, and agree to enter the market as a purchaser, upon an equal footing with private individuals, they will soon be enabled to get all they need at less rates than they are compelled to pay even by impressments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Entering into a fair competition, they will have all the advantages of the market; and the market will be better supplied, because people will no longer be deterred from putting their produce into market for fear of Government impressment agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Congress has recently been tinkering at legislation on the subject; but the best and shortest way to settle the whole matter is to let the people alone &mdash; stop impressments &mdash; and thus reverting back to <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principles (the law of supply and demand) they will arrive at proper conclusions, and supply themselves by entering the market and purchasing what they need or want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This is the only true remedy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> But it seems there is not much use in recommending anything plausible, for the present Congress are certainly not equal to the emergencies of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We will, no doubt, see some children act in the shape of protection for the <rs>Government</rs> against the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But there must be something done quickly upon this sour question of impressment or the <rs>Congress</rs> will aware soon to the reality that there is starvation and subjugation, with plenty in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>There is plenty of grain and wheat in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, but impressment officers cannot get it, and the only way to get at it is to throw upon the market to Government and individuals alike, and it will come forth in surprising quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Let it be tried, at least. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> There is nothing of interest in the department of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, commanded by <persName n="Jones,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Paul,,,:1"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>. --A small skirmish now and then disturbs the monotony and quiet of <persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Paul,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>'s camp <persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Paul,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> and <persName n="Milroy,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Milroy</surname></persName> seem to hold the same card, and consequently the game is blocked.
