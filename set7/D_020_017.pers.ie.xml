<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> At last we have got a Government was the delighted exclamation of a Northern journalist, when the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>, having ascertained the will of its many-headed master, began to exchange its attitude of <unclear>le</unclear> wavering for <num value="1">one</num> of warlike preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The remark aptly expresses the ineffective sympathy of ultra-democracy with high handed displays of power, and it is not, perhaps, without a sinister significance as regards the ulterior results of the struggle into which the model Republic has plunged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>According to present appearance, there is every probability that, if the war lasts any length of time, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people may find, before it is over, that they really have got a Government in a sense little dreamed of by the founders of their constitutional liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>A vigorous Executive, unembarrassed by over-nice notions of legality, seems to be the present ideal of Transatlantic aspirations; end it in an ideal which, under favorable circumstances, is wonderfully apt to realise itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Laws are proverbially silent in the midst of arms; and a civil war, in which the <rs>Central Executive</rs> constitutes itself the organ of the fiercest passions of a democracy, is admirably calumniated to generate what <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> politicians call <q>&#x0022;strong government.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> Some progress has already been made towards this consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In what respect the existing Washington Government differs from a military dictatorship it might take some time to explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We see the <rs>President</rs> assuming and actively exercising powers which might almost content the <rs>Executive</rs> of the most absolute <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> monarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He invites and accepts unlimited offers of men and money from all quarters, and apparently disposes of both at his own unfettered discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>His <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> take military possessions of towns and districts where the jurisdiction of the regular civil authorities has never been formally superseded, and arrest suspected traitors entirely at their own pleasure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> As for Congress, nobody appears to remember its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The institution still survives in contemplation of law, but it seems, practically speaking, quite a superfluity.-- <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, and his Cabinet, and his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and the <rs>Governors</rs> of States, and the volunteers, evidently consider themselves fully equal to all the demands of the crisis; and when Congress does assemble &mdash; which will be just <measure n="10weeks" type="date">ten weeks</measure> after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proclamation of war &mdash; it is not very clear what it will be wanted to do, beyond the routine business of providing supplies for a struggle on which it has never been consulted <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>'s Senate and Legislative body are respectable and influential constitutional authorities compared with the democratic assemblies which the head of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government has not yet thought it necessary to take into his confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>As it is certain that, in the present temper of the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would have found no difficulty in obtaining from the <orgName n="Federal Legislature" type="legislature">Federal Legislature</orgName> any extra legal powers that he might be inclined to demand, this ostentations contempt for constitutional proprieties is the more marked because it is altogether gratuitous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> More than <num value="1">one</num> recent occurrence has given standing proof of the superiority of the <rs>Washington Executive</rs> to legal restraints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> ago, the <rs>President</rs> ordered a razzia to be made, at a given day and hour, on the telegraph offices in all the principal towns of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, on the chance of finding evidence against <q>&#x0022;traitors&#x0022;</q> His officers took forcible possession of the manuscript originals of all telegrams sent to the <rs>South</rs>, during the preceding <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, and carried them off for inspection by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>This arbitrary and violent, but unquestionably smart, proceeding &mdash; which may perhaps afford a useful hint to <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> despotisms &mdash; appears to have been decidedly popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> editors recorded it with undisguised complacency, and evidently admired the sagacity with which the little <hi rend="italics">coup d'etat</hi> was planned, and the dexterity with which it was executed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> The Times' New York correspondent speaks of it with much satisfaction as <q>&#x0022;a bold stroke,&#x0022;</q> and is pleased to think that <q>&#x0022;the possession of such a mass of material gives the <rs>Government</rs> a guarantee for the <unclear>qute</unclear> behavior of suspected and disaffected persons.&#x0022;</q> It is unnecessary to remark that the possession of the bodies of suspected and disaffected persons would furnish a still better guarantee for their quiet behavior; and, in fact, as we shall presently see, this obvious reflection has already suggested itself to some of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Judging from the general approbation which has attended the raid on the telegraphic offices there can be little doubt that Northern opinion would be equally ready to sanction the <q>&#x0022;administrative seizure&#x0022;</q> of the types and presses of an obnoxious Secessionist newspaper &mdash; if, at least, it were possible that such a journal could exist with in reach of a New York mob. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> The last mall brings us word of a still bolder stroke of military usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The collision between <persName n="Cadwallader,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Cadwallader,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cadwallader</surname></persName> and <persName n="Taney,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName> is somewhat absurdly called in the newspapers <q>&#x0022;a conflict of law.&#x0022;</q> but it was, in truth, simply a conflict between law and illegal violence, in which law suffered a total defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It just amounts to this &mdash; that the commander of the <rs>Northern</rs> troops now in occupation of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> has taken it upon him, without so much as the preliminary formality of a proclamation of martial law, to arrest and imprison at his discretion civilians accused or suspected of political offences, and that the authority of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> is summarily set asides by order of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Without any sanction from Congress, and by the simple flat of he <rs type="role2">President</rs> and his General the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> is treated as so much waste paper &mdash; and this, too, in a State which still adheres to the <rs>Union</rs>, and in which the civil authorities have never been superseded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> It is an ominous fact that this daring assumption of military despotism does not appear to excite the smallest objection in any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The Northern newspapers, we are told, are mostly silent on the subject, while some of them urge <persName n="Cadwallader,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Cadwallader,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cadwallader</surname></persName> to arrest a Judge, self convicted of treasonable sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The New York correspondent of the <rs>Times</rs> severely blames <persName n="Taney,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName> for having <q>&#x0022;put the case in a way to excite the already on bittered feelings of the people of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> and remarked that the <rs>General</rs>'s lawless violence <q>&#x0022;in a country which has just been subdued, and which sympathizes actively with the rebels, ought not to be measured by the same criticism that would be applied to such an act in time of peace.&#x0022;</q>--If we are justified in assuming this writer to be a not unfavorable specimen of average Northern opinion, it is clear that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Democracy is fast learning to make a present of its liberties to any Government that will find the means of gratifying its political passions. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The highest test of the popularity of a great movement in the extent to which it commands popular contributions of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>It is now given out that the subscriptions of cotton to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan bids fair to reach the enormous amount of <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of bales, worth a <num value="150000000">hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Liberality like this is really unprecedented in the history of war and finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It denotes a popular sympathy with the efforts of the <rs>Government</rs> to which no political struggle ever engaged in, furnishes a parallel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> There are features belonging to these contributions which no other public loans have ever possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It is made, in the first place, without material privations to the planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The planter who is in debt can employ the bonds of Government which he receives for his cotton, in discharge of his indebtedness, and the subscription costs him nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The planter who is not in debt simply invests in Confederate bonds what he otherwise would have laid out in the purchase of more lands and negroes; and the possession of an <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> fund surely relieves his liberality to the <rs>Government</rs> of the disadvantage of materially curtailing his income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The planter who is neither in debt nor disposed to invest his-earnings in more land and additional negroes, is relieved by the subscription of the perplexity of seeking out subjects of investment, which might prove precarious and unremunerative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>This class of people were too much in the habit of spending their summers in the <rs>Northern</rs> cities and watering places, and of wasting the larger portion of their incomes among Northern hotels and shop-keepers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>When these objects of expenditure failed to absorb their whole revenues, they were generally persuaded by acute brokers and bubble-blowers in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> to lay out their surplus cash in stocks of various fancy schemes as the <rs>North</rs>, which usually promise for a time large incomes, and generally wind up suddenly with terrible and destructive explosion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> It is very clear that the planter is better off with Confederate bonds in his pocket, representing the cost of his Northern trip and of his speculations in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> stocks, than he would have been if he had indulged again his roving habits and made new adventures in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> schemes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> In the next place, the cost of the war to the <rs>South</rs> is, in this manner, very nearly saved, and the advantage is gained, that the money wasted at the <rs>North</rs> in pampering <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> insolence is now expended at the <rs>South</rs> in taking the starch out of that conceited race of upstarts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The money contributed by these planters is retained in the <rs>South</rs> and paid to her own industrial classes for war supplies; whereas, under the old system, it would have gone off to the <rs>North</rs>, never to return, except, perhaps, in the shape of an army at some future day to deprive us of our independence.--By all the difference which money expended in a country makes in its general condition, as compared with the effect of expending the same amount of money out of the country, by all that difference is the <rs>South</rs> gainer by the war in regard to these contributions of her cotton planters to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>We predicate the proposition, of course, upon the assumption that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> will be able to sell the cotton crop for money, when it is ready for delivery next <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> Thus the contribution to this loan, while it does not injure the pecuniary condition of the subscribers to it, effects a positive saving of outlay to the country at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>There is this other advantage attending these cotton subscriptions to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan: The bonds of the <rs>Government</rs> taken in lieu of cotton, are at once <hi rend="italics">placed</hi> in last hands, and are not thrown upon the market, according to the usual custom, to find their way to last purchasers, through <rs n="auction sales" type="product">auction sales</rs> and speculations at the <rs>Stock Boards</rs>, suffering all the <q>&#x0022;hammering&#x0022;</q> and depreciation which that process invariably produces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The usual process is to put Government bonds into the hands of bankers, who act as agents of Government in finding purchasers, and who often manipulate them with as much reference to their own profit as to the <rs>Government</rs>'s advantage, charging at the same time a considerable <hi rend="italics">shave</hi> as commission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> The whole operation is at once saved by putting the bonds directly into the hands of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>All costs of commissions are thus saved, all loss from forced sales, all depreciation from speculating combinations.--The bonds go direct from the hands of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> to the final holders; and, in this instance, into the hands of a class of holders whose wealth and solid condition afford a guarantee that they will rarely get out upon the market, to experience the usual ups and downs of speculative stocks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> In all our study of the history of stocks and finance, we have never known an instance of a public loan which has been put out under so many circumstances of public and private advantage and promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>How much our military organizations lack in discipline may be inferred from the fact that the streets of this city, from day to day and night after night, are filled with drunken, riotous, quarrelsome soldiers, who are permitted to crowd saloons and hotels, and to engage in brawls in the streets with entire impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>I confess I cannot understand it. </p>
