<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>He said it was a drunken Administration, besotted with its isolation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and had never had <num value="1">one</num> honest pulsation for the good of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It was a set of reseals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He had lately been to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and his soul was filled with shame when he saw the streets of that city filled with lunatics and persons looking as if they had come from Bediam or some Free-Love association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The members of the <name>Administration</name>, the speaker said, were not fit to be boot-blacks for his honorable auditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>[Applause] <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is a greater traitor than <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>What has <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName> done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He has merely infringed upon our territorial jurisdiction; he has not struck at the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He believed that we would have to come back to the good old doctrine of State-rights to save the <rs>Republic</rs>, and said that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have no rights, and were marely rested on the solid basis of State-rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Suppose that a State should refuse to elect a Senator or a Representative, where would your <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Congress is nothing but the representative of the <name>States</name>, and this is the only doctrine that can save us. What we want is pluck. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> &#x0022;Yes, sir,&#x0022; continued the speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We want muscle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Why not stop this war now? --Why, my friends, you will ask, &#x0022;How can we do so without disgrace?&#x0022; Why, if you are disgraced now, what will your dishonor amount to <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> hence, if you go on making dead men and public debt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If this Abolition programme was to be carried out, and negroes were to be put in our forts as garrison troops, he, as a peace man, thought it would be his time to turn soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He contemplated the new compromise line with pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It would run East of <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, and would therefore include that State and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>As for <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, he cared very little whether it came in or not. These States might be tolerated in the new Union as a sort of ulcer which could not be taken out until it was perfectly ripe. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Cones, in company with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other buyers, had bought some cotton out at <placeName reg="Moscow, Fayette, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100492">Moscow</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="12miles">twelve miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2032503" n="1.000 2" reg="lagrange, lagrange, indiana">LaGrange</placeName></placeName>, just before our army marched from the latter place, and as <persName n="Quinby,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Quinby,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Quinby</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName> had just removed from there, they thought the sooner they got the cotton into <placeName key="tgn,2032503" n="1.000 2" reg="lagrange, lagrange, indiana">LaGrange</placeName> the better; consequently <num value="4">four</num> of them, besides the drivers of the teams, started out after it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They succeeded in getting the cotton and hurried back until they came in sight of the <rs>Union</rs> pickets at <placeName key="tgn,2032503" n="1.000 2" reg="lagrange, lagrange, indiana">LaGrange</placeName>, and then Conts's <num value="3">three</num> friends, thinking the teams were out of danger, left him and rode on into town. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The place was lonely and fitting to such murderous intents, and Cones says he felt a cold sort of children down the full length of even his long legs. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The affair was pretty generally known among the troops, several of whom managed to escape from the camp and crossed the river on a log. When they arrived here they imparted this information to the proper authorities upon which full and perfect arrangements were made on the part of our batteries to frustrate the success of such an attempt, if it should be made, it is believed that the fear of the batteries having knowledge of the affair, and that they had well prepared for it, kept them from undertaking the voyage. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The probabilities are that an effort will be made to get across the river by the troops stationed below the mouth of the canal, and that the ferry-beat and such of the captured steamers as they may have on hand will be used for this purpose.--If such a move was being made I would not blame the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops much for being disaffected at the prospect of being marched into a slaughter pen. </p>

<head>The currency &mdash; Taxation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The Congress now in session have had under consideration many schemes for improving the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>These generally look for the diminution of the amount of paper afloat by a forced conversion of notes into Confederate bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>None of them as far as we know anything of them, bear the impress of practicability or even justness.--They are better calculated to depreciate the currency than any other cause we are aware of. Indeed, these which propose that all notes of certain issues not presented for conversion into bonds by a certain date shall not be converted into bonds at the rate of interest (<num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num>,) to which they are entitled by the promise on their face, make a proposition plainly fraudulent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> But the <rs>Congress</rs> should, before it runs into these impracticable schemes for retiring the currency, discharge a solemn obligation to the country by passing a tax bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>This act, which is due to the <rs>Government</rs> and the cause, would do something towards bettering the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> paper, and would assist in a measure in diminishing its amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The people, next to fighting and perilling their lives for their country, can give no such proof of confidence in their Government and determination to sustain it as by paying taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>In the estimation of the world, nothing can give so much confidence in the solvency of a Government as the ability and willingness of the people who live under it to pay taxes for its support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> We believe the people of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> are ready to give this proof of their fidelity to the <rs>Government</rs> of their choice, and their representatives will fall of their public duty and prove recreant to the constituent will if they do not pass a liberal and equitable tax bill for the support of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It is a measure indispensable at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It will do more than anything else to improve the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>, and if it is omitted that credit must be seriously diminished, and both Government and people be more and more involved in the dreaded consequences of a depreciated paper currency. </p> </div3>

<head>The winter campaign.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> The winter months will be over on next <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, although we may look for much winter weather during the month of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The enemy at the beginning of the season boasted largely of what they intended to do before it was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Their <num value="1000000">million</num> of men were to restore the fortunes of Yankeedom, and to wipe out by their grand achievements all the disasters of the preceding <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They believed that the scenes of the former winter could be repeated &mdash; that the rise of the <rs>Western</rs> waters would give full play to their gunboats, and that conquests like those of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, would follow fast upon the heels of each other, until all Yankeedom should become unable to shout &#x0022;victory&#x0022; from sheer hoarseness and exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>In the <rs>South</rs>, they supposed that the tragedy of <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName> was to be repeated on a huge scale, with a prodigiously increased number of actors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>They did not take into consideration the very great difference between the state of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> <unclear></unclear> ago and its state at the present moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>At that time supine inertness, misplaced confidence, and a general belief that the war was soon to be closed by foreign intervention, had enfeebled the whole people, and prepared the way for unlimited disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The volunteer system had brought its proper fruits, in leaving us almost without an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Confusion reigned in the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War office</orgName>, and Congress was too much afraid of the &#x0022;dear people&#x0022; to take any steps for the salvation of the public cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The times are very different now. We have <unclear></unclear> that has never fought without conquering &mdash; that has chiefs in whom it relies to lead it to &mdash; victory whenever the long roll-may be beaten for a rally to arms &mdash; that will follow those chiefs whenever they point out the way. It has several others of material equally good, that want only the same experience to be quite equal in every respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>We have, above all, a Secretary at the head of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> who knows what he is about, who does his own duty and makes others attend to theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>We have a conscription which has already saved the country once, and has proved its most powerful bulwark ever since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> Thus far the winter campaign of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> has been a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>In <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> it has been a most disastrous failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>To undertake a winter campaign at all, in fact, without securing enormous advantages, is of itself a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Even great victories scarcely counterbalance the enormous evils which are its inseparable attendant, and it is never undertaken by able chiefs without the prospect of some advantage sufficient of itself to compensate the inevitable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Such an advantage the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have not secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>On the contrary, they have been defeated with great slaughter at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> &mdash; have fought a bloody battle and met with a bloody repulse at <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>', and have been driven back with shame at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Their troops have become demoralized to an extent unknown in war since the <rs>Russian</rs> campaign, by their struggle with the weather and the hardships inseparable from campaigning in this season, and have deserted and died by <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Unless they can succeed at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> &mdash; all <num value="3">three</num> places &mdash; they will have gained nothing whatever to compensate them for the losses and hardships which they have endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>And we can see no prospect whatever of their succeeding at either of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It would have been wiser in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to have taken a lesson from nature, and not to have recommended the war until the gave the signal for the trees to bud and the birds to fly abroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> If we shall be able to retain the several cities now threatened our gain will have been equal to a dozen pitched battles fought and won. We shall open the campaign in the spring with renewed life and the <hi rend="italics">prestiges</hi> of certain success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>We have no means of obtaining a right of things behind the curtain; but, to an outsider, the prospect seems exceedingly fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>We have already shown our enemy that numbers do not always prevail, and if taking the hint, he shall reduce <hi rend="italics">his,</hi> we shall then beat him to death. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
