<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday was <num value="1">one</num> of the most quiet days that has passed since the opening of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The indications at <placeName reg="Petersburg point">Petersburg point</placeName> to a great battle, which cannot be many days delayed, but so far nothing decisive has occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The enemy continue their barbarous practice of shelling that beleaguered city, and some damage to property his resulted there from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The localities known as <placeName reg="Pocahontas, Randolph, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009278">Pocahontas</placeName> and <persName n="Blandford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Blandford,nomatch:0"><surname>Blandford</surname></persName> have suffered, the former quite heavily, and the people have been mostly compelled to abandon that portion of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some injuries to persons are reported, among them a little son of <persName n="Bain,Mister,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Bain,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Bain</surname></persName>, who was badly hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is gratifying to note <num value="1">one</num> circumstance in connection with the shelling, and that is that the <rs type="place">Rock House</rs>, on <address><street n="Market street">Market street</street></address>, occupied as a prison by the captured <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, was struck on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The shell passed through the building from top to bottom, but did not explode, else we might have had the additional satisfaction of recording the death of a number of the vandals at the hands of their own friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The prisoners at once petitioned for a change of quarters, which request the authorities declined to accede to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Upwards of <measure n="400" type="prisoners">four hundred prisoners</measure>, among them <num value="18">eighteen</num> commissioned officers, were brought in between <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Consequently he has employed the leisure afforded by a temporary cessation of heavy fighting in missing his troops on our left, and it is there, probably, that the main attack will be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>That he means to fight, his move in his leave no room to doubt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The larger portion of the enemy's forces are how on the south side of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Those who recently occupied the <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName> Peninsula, or have lately been landed there, were transferred on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is thus threatened by an immense army, but between them stands like a wall of adamant, an army more brave and resolute, which has never yet been, and will not now be, overcome. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The fighting on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> As we Stated yesterday, there was no general engagement on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, though the enemy made several fierce and determined assaults at different points on our lines, each of which was handsomely and signally repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In each instance (says the <hi rend="italics">Express</hi>) their forces were advanced against our breastworks in columns of from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="6">six</num> deep, but were met with such steadiness and <num value="70">seventy</num> of fire from our batteries and infantry, that before reaching the goal of their ambition, they were compelled to fly precipitately and in great confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Time and again their charge was repeated, and with the result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> From all sources our information is that the enemy's loss in these assaults was very severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They advanced across fields &mdash; some of them save all <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in width, in which they were fully exposed to the play of our artillery, which was beautifully and most secretly served, and to the fire of our infantry, which is now rendered ever sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The bodies of their slain strew the fields from side to side, and the nearer our breastworks the assaulting columns came, the thicker the bodies lie. Within the last few days the <orgName>army of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName></orgName> has been depleted by many <num value="1000">thousands</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> On the other hand, as we have already stated, our losses have been comparatively light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The hospitals in <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> testify to the truth of the assertion that so few wounded were never before known in such a series of engagements, while the loss of his has been correspondingly small. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head><dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>'s operations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The operations of Sunday were mainly confined to heavy skirmishing, picket firing and sharpshooting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>As on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, the enemy attempted once or twice to force our lines on <placeName><persName n="Taylor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Charles,E.,,"><surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, (situated on the <placeName key="possibilities=23" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Baxter</placeName> road, near the right of our lines, and the scene of the most active hostilities on both days,) but met with a signal repulse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The enemy's line of battle extends from the <name>Jerusalem</name> plank road all around our former breastworks to the <placeName key="tgn,1121283" n="1.000 30" reg="appomattox, virginia, united states">Appomattox river</placeName> &mdash; their left resting near <persName n="Rives,,Timothy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Rives,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName>'s late residence on the above road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>On their extreme right, near <orgName type="battery" n="Battery 1">Battery No. 1</orgName>, they have placed a formidable gun in position, from which they have been throwing shells over the surrounding country and towards <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <num value="2">Two</num> flags of truce were sent by the enemy towards our lines on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, but nothing relative to their purpose has transpired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> there was some heavy skirmishing in <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002267">Chesterfield county</placeName>, in which the enemy were considerably worsted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Several dwellings have been burnt by the invaders in <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>, among them, reported, are those of <persName n="Hare,Mister,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Hare,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Hare</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beasely,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Beasely,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Beasely</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Gregory,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Gregory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gregory</surname></persName>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Up to the time of writing this paragraph we have no definite account of the operations of yesterday; though a gentleman who left <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> at <time value="6am">6 o'clock, A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The object of the flag of truce on Sunday was to ask permission to bury the dead, which was not granted. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It is evident, from the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> firing heard, that a fight took place, but the result, in the absence of positive information, is a matter of conjecture. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> The timid voice of the citizen, asserting that his rights have been invaded, seems to be overborne by the terrific conflict that is raging about us. But yet, fellow-citizens, terrible and devastating as war is, there is a more serious evil still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It is when citizens' rights, in the broad light of day, but with impressive and eloquent silence, perish before the gaze of a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>[Loud applause.] While our soldiers are engaged in deadly conflict with the foe, whose deadly weapon is pointed at the vitals of the <rs>Republic</rs>, there are repeated blows aimed elsewhere at our rights, at our franchises, at our liberties, and at our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Not that you have criticisms to urge upon the conduct of our champions in the field; not that you doubt their ability to sustain the shock of war; not that you are at all in suspense at the result; but that the constitutional period had arrived when citizens throughout this land must speak freely, determinedly, and resolutely upon the subject of the rights of man [Applause] Not, fellow citizens, that I should advise any of you for a moment to impair the power of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The Government is ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> We have no criticisms to bestow in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>We are content with that portion of the operations of the <rs>Government</rs>, and nothing that can be directed toward them must be imputed to us as to unworthy motives, or to that lukewarm doubt which insinuates a question of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>But, fellow-citizens, allow me for a few moments to attract your attention to those grievances in civil life, which, if permitted to remain unredressed, and continue in the direction in which they have, their diverging lines will soon open a vast field of deserted interests, rights, and liberties, which will pall the eye of the most stead fast. </p> </div4>

<head>The War a question of finance.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>There is a time when in my opinion, the question of war is absorbed in the question of finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>There never has been and never can be a war, conducted as all wars have been and will be, in which, at some <num value="1">one</num> period thereof, the question of the continuation of the war does not become absolutely a question of finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>For instance, we are destroying our enemy at the front; are we creating a more formidable enemy at home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We have annihilated him; are we annihilated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It there be danger of the latter, that danger must be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Hence, at such a period of the war, when it becomes a question of finance no people can pretend to any degree of wisdom if, in their spirit of fell revenge, they are willing to destroy their enemy at their own expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The object of war is not revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It may be the weapon of outrage; but with nations the creation and continuance of the body politic is the prime object, and any attempts upon the enemy that would destroy the life of a nation certainly are suicidal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We must be careful of the state of our finances, and see that while we are crushing the enemy on the <num value="1">one</num> side, we are not injuring the people on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>For instance, if we are expending, as I believe we are, over <num value="4000000">four millions</num> a day, and if we are in receipt at this time of no more than <num value="1000000">one million</num> a day, it becomes the people to consider the magnitude of the debt we are rolling up, and to demand at all points such a rigid, exact, and scrupulous economy, that there shall not <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> issue from the <name>Treasury</name> that does not go for the absolute wants of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> I do not mean to criticise the honesty of our rulers, but I do mean to allude to that bevy of depredators, that fell band of plunderers, that miserable set of public peculators placing their hands in the coffers of the country, and drawing them out reeking with the blood of our citizens and crying &#x0022;patriotism&#x0022; and &#x0022;loyalty;&#x0022; I aim my remarks at &#x0022;shoddy; I bid you beware of shoddy; excise shoddy form the body politic like a miserable fungus praying at the vitals of the nation, absorbing the taxes which men are depleting their hard earned savings to pay, in order that they may sustain this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It was not altogether through fear of them as a political rival, although they had grown to such an extent as to have become formidable to every nation of the earth.
