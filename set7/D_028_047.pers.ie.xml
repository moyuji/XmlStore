<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> At the beginning of this contest, there was <num value="1">one</num> statesman of the <rs>South</rs>, now in his grave, who stood alone in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and we may almost say the continent, in his opinion of the probability of <name>English</name> intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This was the late <persName n="Floyd,,John,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Floyd,John,B.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He maintained, with distinctness and emphasis, that it was not merely the disruption of the old Union which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> sought, but the material ruin of the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents, in order that she might relieve herself of the commercial rivalry of the <num value="1">one</num> and be in dependent of the cotton of the other; compelling the world to look to herself for not only the manufacture but the production of her own staple &mdash; an inferior kind, it is true, but still the best (Southern cotton out of the way) they could get. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> We well recollect the incredulity with which these views of <persName n="Floyd,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> were generally received, and yet time has set the seal of truth to every word he uttered, and added another to the many illustrations his life afforded of statesmanlike sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It only needed the application to the probable policy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> of the infallible standard of self-interest to know what would be her course in this war. The interest of nations is their only principle, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is certainly no exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We speak of her as a government, not as a people, when we say that nowhere on the face of the earth, in ancient or modern times, can be found more intense selfishness than controls her councils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Her policy towards <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, in particular, has been so cold-blooded and persistent in its purposes of self-aggrandizement and revenge that no penalty she can pay can ever reach the measure of her crime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> For <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> she has labored with deep and unflagging determination to produce the disunion of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>She was actuated in those labors by the combined influences of interest and revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>She never forgave the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The loss of the most resplendent jewels of her crown was an unpardonable sin. The late war added a fresh flame, which has never yet been extinguished, to her bitter exasperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>She would have forgiven the successes of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> in the <rs>North</rs>, and of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,F.,,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in the <rs>South</rs>, but her naval disasters were a rankling thorn which the hand of time could neither extract nor soothe.--Up to that period, she had been the acknowledged naval mistress of that element, and it was necessary she should be so to protect the trade by which she lives, and to secure her existence as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate Power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> once declared that, geographically, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was but a province of the <rs>Grand Empire</rs>, but between <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> rolled an ocean which even the genius of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> could never bridge over to his coveted prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Suddenly appeared upon the waters a flag which, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, caused the meteor glories of the <rs>British</rs> banner to trail the sea. In all the late war she only gained <num value="2">two</num> victories in the contest of ship to ship &mdash; a poor consolation for a long series of crushing defeats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Thenceforth the spell of <name>British</name> naval supremacy was broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There was another nation whose sailors were as good as her own &mdash; a nation with nautical tastes and aptitudes, and with unlimited resources of ship- building and of men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> As time passed on, the commerce of this new rival began to overspread the world,--and not only her commerce &mdash; she produced in abundance cotton which could not be equalled in quality in any <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> other part of the habitable globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Her manufactures, moreover, began to improve; her western forests were cleared up with unexampled rapidity, and her population increased at a rate unexampled in the history of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> stood idly by, the time was, evidently, not distant when her trans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Atlantic rival would overtop her own gigantic proportions, and drive her from the arena of commercial and manufacturing enterprise, and despite her power and influence among the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It was useless for her to attempt to get rid of this competition by war. Her experiments in that way had been too costly and fruitless to warrant their repetition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>She, therefore, looked with eager eyes for some vulnerable point in the armor of the young giant, and thought she found it in the slavery institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> She had planted slavery here herself; she had poured in slaves upon us contrary to our earnest remonstrances; she had been the great slave trader of the world; but what mattered that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At once she made the discovery that slavery was the greatest of human abominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Her public sentiment underwent at once a transformation little short of miraculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>All her organs of public opinion sounded the same emancipation note.--The pulpit, the press, the bar, the literature of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, became thoroughly saturated with the new philanthropy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The leaders of society gave the cold shoulder to slaveholders as the most execrable and wicked of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>All these influences were brought to bear upon the non-slaveholding communities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Emissaries, with their pockets lined with <name>English</name> gold, came to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> to stimulate what was then a feeble anti-slavery sentiment in the <rs>North</rs>; to encourage the organization of Abolition societies; to circulate Abolition tracts; to inflame the <rs>Northern</rs> public mind against the institutions and principles of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>For nearly <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has been pushing on with her whole moral power, and, no doubt, such material aid as she could furtively render, a crusade which could have no other possible end than the disunion of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The wedge was at last driven home, the once stately tree toppled to its foundation, the flames of war lighted a once peaceful land, and then, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, the conscience of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> ceased to be exercised upon the subject of Slavery.--Since the war began, we have heard very little from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> of that iniquity.--Since the war began, she has discovered that something can be said on both sides of that question; that slaveholders are not unmitigated monsters, but, on the contrary, are very chivalric and <name>Christian</name> gentlemen, who had been grossly misrepresented and misunderstood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> These newly acquired lights of intelligence do not, however, prevail upon her to afford us anything more than the light of her amiable countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>She is not disposed to demonstrate her newborn sympathies by any practical works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>She is careful to inform us by every mail that reaches this continent that she means to take sides with neither belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>She furnishes arms to both parties with indiscriminate impartiality, and hopes they will have a fair fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is possible she deplores our defeats, but surely not on our account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>She would rejoice to see our blood flowing for <num value="0.5">a half</num> century, or any other long period of time, so it did not exhaust our veins, till the <rs>North</rs> was equally exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>She fears that we may fall, because she apprehends that, in that event, she may be called upon to pay the arrears of a long account, and that both parties may find a new bond of union in vengeance for common wrongs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> In any event of this war, it is impossible that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should derive permanent advantage from the success, thus far, of her schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Her policy is as short sighted as it is malevolent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It will not take many years to neutralize the advantages her commerce has gained.--She has many enemies in the world, and there may be a combination hereafter which, proud and powerful as she is, may test, as it has never yet been tested, her strength and stability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Her policy has not gained her friends in either of the <num value="2">two</num> warring nations on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We are neither dolts nor idiots that we do not recognize in her the hand that has stimulated the passions <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> and sharpened the swords that have drank our best blood. </p> </div3>

This is no time for <hi rend="italics">much</hi> learning, and every <num value="1">one</num> knows that a little is dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Posterity will excuse the young men of this generation, if they are ignorant on all other points, so they know how to save their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>If they do not know that, it matters little on what other points they are enlightened or unenlightened; for people in that condition may as well be ignorant as educated, and as for the voice of Posterity, there is not likely to be, in that event, any posterity worth listening to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Our object in these reflections is to advise all parents whose sons will soon arrive at the military age not to be so anxious about their education as to smuggle them off to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, nor to entertain such contracted ideas of their real welfare as to lay cunning plans of any kind for keeping them out of the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We have no allusions to any of the falling-back generals when we say that the safest place a youth can now be placed in is the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Not the safest, perhaps, for his arms and legs, but for his manhood, his honor, his future estimation among men, and perhaps his morals and his soul. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> It is no longer a question with parents whether they can send their sons to colleges and universities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Colleges are broken up, universities turned into hospitals; or, if any are not, the few students have only to step out of doors to see a history enacting, which of course drives out of their heads the worm-eaten leaves that record the history of worm-eaten ages, long ago dead and buried.--You might as well ask them to pore over the wood cuts in a &#x0022;natural history&#x0022; when whole tribes of lions, elephants, grizzly bears, hippopotami, are roaring, growling, trumpeting, slaughtering and devouring under their windows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The best possible place for a young man's education is now the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The choicest vintage of the nation's grapes, the purest wine of her life, is now in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If the coming generation cannot be sent to schools of intellectual training, let them at least be sent to schools of honor, generosity and patriotism.--Better have a son grow up with noble sentiments and a lofty sense of duty to principle and to country than to become a selfish, groveling, mercenary, money -making machine, which is all that any education outside the army is now likely to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Any man who takes an intelligent view of the welfare and happiness of a child would sooner see him dead and in a better world than to see him become a fattened swine in selfishness and extortion, and trained up only to accumulate Confederate notes and lose his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>If we are to be subjugated, blessed, thrice blessed, are the dead, who have perished, or may perish, in endeavoring to prevent it, and who will not see the downfall of the <rs>Republic</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> If a Confederate parent now wishes to teach his son the way to live, and the way to die, let him send him, as soon as he reaches the military age, to the bronzed and battle-scarred veterans in the front. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> &#x0022;Whereas, the condition of our country, at the present time, in consequence of reverses and late disasters, while it does not justify a feeling of despondency or shake our confidence in our ultimate success, creates the imperative necessity for a prompt development of all our resources; and whereas, in the opinion of our wisest generals and statesmen, we have a powerful element of strength hitherto not brought to bear upon our enemy in this great struggle; therefore </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That negro philanthropy, as practiced by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, is but a hideous and fiendish mockery; that method of ameliorating his condition, their policy and treatment of the negro, but tends to lower and degrade him in the <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> scale of humanity; that the <rs>Southern</rs> master, who takes care of his slave in his hoary old age, nurses him in sickness and cares for him in his helplessness, is the true philanthropist, and not the almighty-dollar <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, who turns him away to die, as best he may, when his services are no longer valuable.--Therefore we earnestly urge the immediate use of this lever of strength, as we regard it humane and morally justifiable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th instant</day></dateStruct>, with reference to the employment of negroes as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I think the measure not only expedient, but necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The enemy will certainly use them against us if he can get possession of them; and as his present numerical superiority will enable him to penetrate many parts of the country, I cannot see the wisdom of the policy of holding them to await his arrival, when we may, be timely action and judicious management, use them to arrest his progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>I do not think that our white population can supply the necessities of a long war without overtaxing its capacity and imposing great suffering upon our people; and I believe we should provide resources for a protracted struggle &mdash; not merely for a battle or a campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> &#x0022;In answer to your <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> question, I can only say that, in my opinion, the negroes, under proper circumstances, will make efficient soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I think we could at least do as well with them as the enemy, and he attaches great importance to their assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Under good officers and good instructions, I do not see why they should not become soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>They possess all the physical qualifications, and their habits of obedience constitute a good foundation for discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They furnish a more promising material than many armies of which we read in history, which owed their efficiency to discipline alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>I think those who are employed should be freed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It would be neither just nor wise, in my opinion, to require them to serve as slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The best course to pursue, it seems to me, would be to call for such as are willing to come with the consent of their owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>An impressment or draft would not be likely to bring out the best class, and the use of coercion would make to their measure distasteful to them and to their owners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> &#x0022;I have no doubt that if Congress would authorize their reception into service, and empower the <rs>President</rs> to call upon individuals or States for such as they are willing to contribute, with the condition of emancipation to all enrolled, a sufficient number would be forthcoming to enable us to try the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>If it proved successful, most of the objections to the measure would disappear, and if individuals still remained unwilling to send their negroes to the army, the force of public opinion in the <name>States</name> would soon bring about such legislation as would remove all obstacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>I think the matter should be left, as far as possible, to the people and to the <name>States</name>, which alone can legislate as the necessities of this particular service may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>As to the mode of organizing them, it should be left as free from restraint as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Experience will suggest the best course, and it would be inexpedient to trammel the subject with provisions that might, in the end, prevent the adoption of reforms suggested by actual trial. </p> <closer> <salute>&#x0022;With great respect,</salute> <lb/> <salute>&#x0022;Your obedient servant,</salute> <lb/> <signed>&#x0022;<persName n="Lee,,R.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="default:Lee,R.,E.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, General.&#x0022;</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We have had ships fitted out here which have been afterward sent to a great distance, and have there received their arms and ammunition, and have been used for the purpose of war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> We had in our hands correspondence showing that Confederate agents were constantly employed in purchasing ships in this country, which were afterward sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and thence to other stations, to be fitted out and employed as cruisers against the commerce of the <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>And I do say, in fairness, that when the authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> see a number of ships coming, some way or other, from <name>English</name> ports and <name>English</name> rivers, and afterward used as ships of war to injure their commerce, which has very grievously suffered from that cause, it is natural that they should feel that they have considerable matter of irritation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>But they ought, at the same time, to ask themselves whether the <rs>British Government</rs> has done all that the law of nations authorizes, and that the municipal law of this country permits, to prevent this country from being made the basis of warlike operations, so as to involve us in war with that Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>With regard to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, the noble <rs>Earl</rs> seems to imagine that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, from mere hostility to us, had denounced that useful convention with regard to the lakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>But the case was that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, apparently seeking, if possible, to involve this country in war, and finding their own resources insufficient to carry on a successful war, sent persons into the lakes (which are no part of their own territory, but which belong either to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> or <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>), to take possession by force of certain vessels, and to set free certain persons who were prisoners of war of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> I say again that it was not wonderful that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, considering that the lakes were in the possession of a Sovereign friendly to them, should be indignant when they found that operations of war were carried on in those lakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They adopted a mode which I think again was not unnatural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>They say that if they remain in those lakes with unarmed ships the <rs>Confederates</rs> would come into those lakes and take possession of those ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It is a very painful thing, and a matter dangerous to the peace of the <num value="2">two</num> countries, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should be obliged to suspend that convention which was so useful to the interests of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>I cannot expect that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should ever permit that war should be made against them on the lakes, and that they should be without the means of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>For my own part, I think that, though it may be natural on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, their attempt to make <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canadian</placeName> soil a basis for operations &mdash; some, no doubt, of a belligerent character, but others more resembling the robberies and murders that take place in social life &mdash; are doing that which is most unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>And I trust that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government will be enabled as they proposed to the <orgName n="Canadian Parliament" type="parliament">Canadian Parliament</orgName>, to preserve the neutrality of this country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> At the same time, in the irritation that has been aroused, there has been a disposition with respect to <num value="2">two</num> questions to make most unfounded accusations against the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. --They have complained that we have allowed a belligerent character to the belligerent States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Well, looking at the character of the contest, at the extent of the territory which they occupy, and at the great operations of war which they have carried on, what could we do but allow them the character of belligerents [Cheers.] I know of no instance in which there has been so mighty an enterprise of war carried on, and in which a belligerent character has not been allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>There is another question with regard to which there has been a great deal of popular agitation, and every now and then there has been a sort of threat that the day will come when the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> will make demands upon <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Your Lordships heard last year, and the year before, that demands would be made for the capture and destruction of merchant ships by the <rs>Alabama</rs> and other vessels having some of their original build in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which were afterwards conveyed to distant parts, and there received armaments which enabled them to cruise against the commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> I must say, my Lords, looking at of the precedents, looking at the international law, looking at the declarations that were made by the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> themselves in the case of the <rs>Spanish</rs> and <rs>Portuguese</rs> war, when there were ships of war directly fitted out from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> port for the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent, where they preyed on the commerce of <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Portugal" key="tgn,1000090">Portugal</placeName>, that such a claim upon the <rs>Government</rs> of this country would be utterly unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Well, I say that while we make every allowance for irritation that may arise in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the course of the war which has come upon them unexpectedly, and has caused to both sides a great loss, we think unnecessarily, and are most strict and scrupulous in performing all the duties of neutrality, we must not allow any unfounded claims to be pressed as founded in justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> thing I cannot help saying before I sit down, on a subject affecting the welfare of mankind.--When I see in this <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> contest an attempt to put an end to that horrible and abominable crime of keeping men in slavery, and putting an end forever to involuntary servitude in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, I do rejoice that it great blot is about to be removed from the character of a civilized nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>I do rejoice that mankind may hope that the crime of slavery may be blotted out forever and freedom be the rule of the world. </p> </div3>
