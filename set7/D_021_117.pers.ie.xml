<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/> It is known to perhaps many of your readers that when our army retired from <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, <persName n="Cullen,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="mostcommon:Cullen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cullen</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, accompanied by a party of <num value="12">twelve</num>, consisting principally of medical officers, returned under a flag of truce to attend to our wounded, left in and near the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The college building and the churches of the place were used as public hospitals, and some of our men were received in private houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/> The Federal officers to a man, and soldiers almost to a man, showed the kindest disposition towards their unfortunate prisoners, moving them with tenderness, and frequently sharing with them the scanty contents of their haversacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>But in consequence of the confusion resulting from the battle and the constant movement of their troops, there was for several days no issue of other commissary or hospital stores, and the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers, as well as our own, suffered exceedingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>It is but justice to say, that if any preference was manifested, it was in favor of our men. In spite of this, however, some of our wounded would have well nigh starved had it not been for the noble women of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, who scraped the bottoms of their barrels, exhausted by previous charities, and prepared food for the soldiers, ignorant how their own for the coming week was to be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The remark was made to <num value="1">one</num> lady who was thus giving, not out of hor abundance, that it was hoped she would be rewarded both in this world and the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/> From every appearance, the eventful hour so long anticipated is at last upon us. The enemy are advancing by five different roads converging in <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, and are probably now within <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> of our entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Our pickets have been drawn in, the entire army is under marching orders, a portion are already behind our defences, and the work of preparation is silently progressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act in the approaching drama was performed yesterday. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/> The Federals, several <num value="1000">thousand</num> strong, supported by a heavy body of cavalry and <num value="2">two</num> batteries of artillery, made a demonstration upon <num value="1">one</num> of our brigades under the command of <persName n="Marmaduke,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="mostcommon:Marmaduke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Marmaduke</surname></persName>, stationed on the front, about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile beyond <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>The latter is a small place northeast of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, distant about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>, Firing between the pickets commenced between <time value="1">one</time> and <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>. Our skirmishers were then deployed and we drove them back Meanwhile the brigade, in pursuance of a preconcerted plan, retired a short distance to a better position, and here the entire force of <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> engaged the enemy and maintained a desperate resistance in the face of overwhelming odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Between <time value="5">five</time> and <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> the <rs>Federals</rs> brought up their batteries, and then commenced between the opposing artillery a fierce interchange of sho's which lasted for nearly an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Covered by this, the enemy made hank movements on right and left, and the result was a further retreat of our forces through Farming on and towards <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>In truth, such was the damaging effect of the shells-and they were thrown with great precision &mdash; that our men could not withstand the storm, and the greater portion of <num value="2">two</num> regiments scattered in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The remainder of the brigade came <sic>in in</sic> good order, without any attempt by the enemy at pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Our artillery, which numbered only <num value="4">four</num> pieces, is known as the <placeName reg="Sweat">Sweat</placeName> Battery, of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg, Mississippi</placeName>, and gallantly did it maintain its position and return the heavy thunder of the <rs>Federal</rs> guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/> Our loss cannot be less than <measure n="20" type="killed">20 killed</measure>, and about <measure n="100" type="wounded">100 wounded</measure>. That of the enemy was doubtless greater; in addition to which we <measure n="50" type="captured">captured 50</measure> prisoners, including a Major of Engineers, a Missourian from <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>They left for <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> this morning, and a sorrier looking set of humanity I never beheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>They were course, ignorant fellows, marked with brutality and imbecility in every line and angle of their <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> faces, and devoid of a solitary redeeming trait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Meet of them are <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> and <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, evidently born and bred amidst the richest comfort of social corruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>From the <rs>Federal Major</rs> I could glean not a word, except that the fight was a <q>&#x0022;reconnaissance in force.&#x0022;</q> Upon all other topics he was deaf, dumb, irresistible and impregnable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/> There is little doubt, however, that the demonstration was part of the general design to occupy our front lines as a basis of operations, and to enable the enemy to make a heavy flank movement, which, from their actions, is evidently in contemplation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Their present success has necessitated the concentration of our out posts nearer the center, and of course has narrowed our circle of operations to the focus from which we expect to deal out death and destruction; but we are proportionately stronger than before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/> From various Northern accounts I have been led to suppose that the <rs>Federal</rs> army would bring against us <num value="130000">130,000</num> men. I now have good reason to believe it does not number more than <num value="100000">100,000</num> at the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Sickness is making fearful havoc in their ranks, and not withstanding the admirable sanitary regulations devised by Northern ingenuity, hundreds are every day disabled and carried to the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/> During the excitement incident to the attack of yesterday, the promptitude and discipline which marked every movement of our troops, was gratifying beyond measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>The old adage that <q>&#x0022;large bodies move slowly,&#x0022;</q> was in this instance completely reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>The heavy tones of the artillery had scarcely rang through the forests, before every man was in his place, and the &#x0022;long roll found the army ready for action Guns were shotted, haversacks hastily filled, heavy garments thrown aside, and everything dispensed with that could impede the marching or fighting of the men. Everywhere you saw enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The men of the <rs>West</rs> in their rude homespun, with their shot guns, rifles, antique muskets, and home-made <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs>, were not <num value="1">one</num> whit behind the sons of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, or <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, who have the advantage of superior drill and arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Old men and young boys officers and privates &mdash; all appeared fired with patriotic ardor, once more to cross arms with the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Sick men left their beds to join the long processions of solders that filed away over the hills and through the valleys, and not a laggard was left behind who was ashamed to do his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>It was indeed a glorious spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>At army of such numbers as this pressing forward to give battle, with artillery, cavalry, trains of ambulances and wagons and all the paraphernalia of the occasion, wending along in an interminable current, is a sight which once seen can never be forgotten. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/> Last night our troops slept on their arms To-day a heavy rain--<num value="1">one</num> of those cold storms which thrown man's equanimity into a bilious fever &mdash; has set in, and the prospects of an engagement have materially lessened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> With the return of pleasant weather, however, I do not think that the events can be long delayed; and as soon as the ground is once more in marching order, you may prepare for details of a conflict before which all others of which this continent has yet been the theatre will pale in the comparison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/> Some there are who profess to believe that the fall of New Orleans will cause a change in the <rs>Federal</rs> programme, and that their commander-in-chief will retire towards <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> without risking the loss of life and the destruction of the army which would result from a general battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>It is extremely improbable, however, that the <rs>Northern</rs> army will now dare to retreat, in the face of the moral sentiment of the people that has urged it on, even though it be to accomplish a bloodless victory in taking possession of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/> P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>A desperate attempt is being made to get in our rear, hem us in, and cut off the means of escape in case of defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>Skirmishing has been going on all day with an all arms, and an occasional discharge of field pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>A decisive hour is undoubtedly at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>The line of battle will probably be not less than <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> long &mdash; Except by telegraph, you can hardly expect to receive details of the fight at once.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/> <measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> of rain have thrown a damper upon our expectations of a battle, and we now have to wait for warm sunshine, firm ground, and dry roads before our anticipations can be immediately resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>Even then the silence of the enemy is more provoking than inspiring because of the uncertainly which invests their future operations Since the skirmish at <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName>, reported in my last, they have been as quiet as death, excepting the usual small warfare which takes place between the pickets, and it is unknown whether they will follow up this preliminary attack or not. Some affect to believe that there will be no battle; that the intelligence of the capture of New Orleans will change their programme, and, notwithstanding their closed proximity, that they will content themselves with cutting off our supplies between here and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and if possible, strike a blow at the <orgName n="Mobile and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Mobile and Ohio railroad</orgName>, and thus also interrupt our communication with <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus, Miss.</placeName>, which to us is an important post. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/> My own impression, derived from <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">General officers</rs>, is that there will be a fight and that the delay is incidental entirely to the state of the weather, and the fact that the <rs>Federals</rs> require time to make themselves acquainted with our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>With our extended line, this cannot be done in less than a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>The reconnaissance which resulted in the fight of Saturday was a portion of these operations, and the daily advance of their scouting parties upon our front is further proof of the correctness of this view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Another significant fact, indicative of the intention of the enemy, is that for <num value="3">three</num> day they have been massing an immense force upon our right flank, and have by a sudden dash cut off the <orgName n="Memphis and Charleston Railroad" type="railroad">Memphis and Charleston Railroad</orgName> <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> above us. This event is comparatively unimportant <hi rend="italics">per as</hi> but it may be made the basis of another foray upon the <orgName n="Mobile and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Mobile and Ohio Railroad</orgName> <num value="6">6</num> or <measure n="7miles" type="distance">7 miles</measure> beyond, the success of which would </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> temporarily produce serious difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>These movements show that the enemy are active along our right at least, and their demonstrations cannot be without some ulterior object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>I am daily expecting similar movements against our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>No fears, however, can reasonably be entertained as to the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>We have a force amply sufficient to defend our entire line, and thanks be to <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, the nature of the country is such that the enemy cannot bring anything like organized forces to bear upon us. They must creep through woods and undergrowth, naturally impassable to artillery, until their troops are face to face with us, and then we shall have them in our tolls, of open fields there are few or none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Consequently, with all their odds against us, we are fully their equal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/> It is not improbable that the <rs>Federals</rs> are employing their spare time in entrenching themselves in front of us. The object of this is to prevent a rout, and enable them to fall back upon a position in which, they can resist our advance, should the immaculacy of our troops impel them beyond our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>It looks on the face of it merciful and reasonable enough in a conqueror, but you needn't rely on these soft words, for, notwithstanding the minute in his particulars, he is keeping a sharp watch for an opportunity of laying his grasp on some of the prominent men in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/><persName n="Soule,,Pierre,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00506" reg="default:Soule,Pierre,,,"><foreName>Pierre</foreName> <surname>Soule</surname></persName>, who has acted as spokesmen for the municipal authorities, will, I am afraid, find himself in trouble soon unless he makes his escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Several prominent gentlemen likely to suffer have already prudently retired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/> Under the assurance of the enemy's commander, there is a stronger feeling of security among the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>They begin to believe that their houses will not be nasties by the forced presence of the marauder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>They will not be knocked down and <q>&#x0022;dragged out&#x0022;</q> on the streets, or have their <q>&#x0022;things&#x0022;</q> stolen indiscriminately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>But this is only the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Just as soon as the enemy find that they have the city secure, you may look out for a rigorous enforcement of the right of the conqueror to govern as it best leases him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/> There is no doubt that a good many are willing to submit to their condition &mdash; welcome it. There are persons who have never favored the cause, except as it was needful to do so in order to gather their profits from their business, but I am glad to hear that the honeyed phrases of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00507" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s proclamation have not in the least shaken the fealty of the mass of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>They are per force held fast, but only await the moment to let the invader know where their hearts and their weapons are. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> Very little news can be gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The papers are careful to keep the wolf from their doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>That is prudent and is a condition precedent of their not being pitched overboard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/> The streets are not what they were by a long way. The night is dark, and citizens sit around the circle of their household gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>There are none of those lively street groups that used to make nightfall pleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>People speak with <q>&#x0022;bated breath;&#x0022;</q> but they keep up a good deal of thinking and in assured coteries express their abhorrence of the foe, and talk in a whisper of the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> The <placeName reg="Creole, Cameron, Louisiana" key="tgn,2042592">Creole</placeName> population, as far as I can learn, are earnestly loyal to their own Government; and it is no secret that there is a vast amount of chagrin and disappointment as regards the tame surrender of the city &mdash; not after the enemy's boats reached the city, but in the blunders, or treachery, or lack of zeal in the cause, which induced the fall of the forts and kept unworked the other means to block the advance to the face of the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/> But it is almost with tears that I allude to the subject at all. I have no heart to dwell on the painful subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>I think, however, that you may rest assured that the present calm of the population is not of despair.--<measure n="60days" type="date">Sixty days</measure> the city may be cursed by this foe, but I think not longer, unless disaster follow disaster as for the past months, and no hope shall be left of sweeping the enemy, except Yellow <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00508" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>, whose presence hundreds of the true citizens invoke morning, noon and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Anything than the presence of the enemy &mdash; anything but to feel that the citizens are watched, have no use of their tongues, and may be at any moment scourged or imprisoned, or their property destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>It is a most painful position to any <num value="1">one</num> with a spark of true manhood in his bosom. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
