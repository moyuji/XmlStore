<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> [From the <orgName n="Norfolk Day book" type="newspaper">Norfolk Day Book</orgName>, <date value="05-20">May 20th.</date>] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> Yesterday (<dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>) evening, about <num value="4">four</num> or <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>, a small schooner from below passed up, and when near the <rs>Monticello</rs> she fired a gun which passed over the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is not known positively whether she fired at the schooner or at the battery; though it is asserted by some that the schooner was acting in the capacity of a look-out for the steamer, and had sent a boat alongside of her before she fired the gun. The idea is, that the schooner got as near the fort as possible, and sent a man up on her mast-head to spy into the fort, those inside being unconscious of what was going on, and deeming her a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>However, that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun was taken as a banter, and the battery answered it with as much spirit and rapidly as convenience would allow, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> ball, we understand, taking effect in her rigging, much of which was cut away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The firing continued for some considerable time, by both the steamer and the battery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The <num value="2">two</num> rifle-cannon, it is said, done the most execution, a shell from <num value="1">one</num> of which it is reported bursted on striking the steamer's rigging, though it is not known whether it proved fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The steamer was struck in her hull several times, nearly amidships, and <num value="1">one</num> hole we understand was knocked into her side, large enough for a flour barrel to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The steamer's battery was finally silenced, and about that time the <num value="2">two</num> little steamers, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> and the <rs>Young America</rs>, came up, both of which we understand fired a few bails at the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They all <num value="3">three</num> then started off down the river, towards <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> It is the general impression that the <rs>Monticello</rs> is seriously crippled, from the manner in which she was careened over when she left, and probably from her having ceased her fire so quick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The shot and shell from the steamers few over the battery, many of them striking a mile in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><num value="1">One</num> shell bursted near the battery without injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A piece of it, weighing <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5l." type="pounds"><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>, we saw last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The tops of the pine trees in the neighborhood were pretty well cut down by the shot and shell from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the boughs and splinters were scattered about with a good deal of activity, though with no bad results, except the scratching of the hand of <num value="1">one</num> of the staff officers who was present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> It gives us pleasure to hear so glowing a report of the spirit of bravery which was brought out in this engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>We feel satisfied that our cause is in the hands of the right kind of men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> During the cannonading, we understand, some of the infantry sallied out on the beach and discharge their small arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>(<persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> rifles, we presume,) at the <rs>Monticello</rs>, she being, what was considered at the time, within range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It is said that every man engaged on shore acted the part of a hero; the only regret being that they were not more thoroughly prepared for the occasion, by having their heavy ordnance in better condition for the reception of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The only Injury, we understand, with the exception of the staff officer, was that received by <persName n="Morris,Mister,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Morris,William,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <surname>Morris</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Woodis Rifle</rs> corps, who got his ankle bruised by the re- bound of <num value="1">one</num> of the big guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>We understand the injury is very slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Not a shot of the enemy struck the works to injure them, most of them passing far over head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/><q>&#x0022;Nobody hurt&#x0022; </q> on our side, though we don't believe we can say the same thing for the enemy, as the appearent confusion on board seemed to indicate otherwise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> It is thought by some that this attack on our battery is intended as a <hi rend="italics">russ </hi> to draw our attention from some point of more importance to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>However this may be, they will likely find it unavailing, as our people now begin to realize that they are at war and have got fighting to do, which, judging from the eagerness displayed by <q>&#x0022;the boys,&#x0022;</q> they will do to perfection if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will only give them a chance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> By others it is surmised that the attack on that unfinished battery was intended merely to demolish it; that they did not know it was there till they discovered it on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, while in pursuit of the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Kahukee</rs>, and finding it unprepared to return their fire, they anchored near by to deter our folks from working on it.
