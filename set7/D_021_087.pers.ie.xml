<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> I take the occasion of a brief visit to this city to note some of the note-worthy incidents and facts which have presented themselves to me on my journey and while enjoying the hospitalities of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> Everywhere on the line of road I found the condition of our troops excellent and the health of but very few comparatively requiring the attention of the surgeons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In like manner, and arising no doubt from the same cause, (for health is the greatest invigorator of the mind and remedy of diseased imaginations.) I found all desirous of active service and willing to inaugurate a guerilla warfare, since the enemy seem determined to give them no opportunity to attack in force or to make any formidable movement on our lines of defence.--The misfortunes of their outposts have been accumulating upon them, the activity of <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>'s troops having in several instances caused them the loss of men within a few yards of their pickets, and even strong regiments within short distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>So much has been done that they have finally abandoned <placeName reg="Little Edisto Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2454977">Little Edisto Island</placeName>, where a strong detachment had been posted, after having no doubt caused all the loss and injury that was in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Our forces, which until lately have been encamped along the line of railway, has been advanced from <unclear><placeName reg="Pocotaligo, Jasper, South Carolina" key="tgn,2589001">Pocotaligo</placeName>,</unclear> <placeName reg="Coosawhatchie, Jasper, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095609">Coosawhatchie</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Hardeeville, Jasper, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095951">Hardeeville</placeName>, their respective depots, to a point nearer the coast and in proximity to <placeName reg="Bluffton, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095374">Bluffton</placeName>, the scene of the foray attempted some weeks since, from which point any landing between <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName> may be easily defended, and our forces concentrated to resist any more formidable attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Indeed, the impression has gained strength here, as well as in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> do not design any such movement, but threaten with the object solely of keeping our troops from being forwarded to points of vital importance either in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The long service which our troops have seen here is at least fitting them for a more vigorous campaign when transferred to other localities; and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> will, like <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, have a large number of regiments of State troops, or those organized for local defence, in a thorough state of discipline and equipment, ready, at the call of the <rs>Governor</rs>, to respond heartily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The State has done nobly in this cause, in which she has borne the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> burst, and in which she has borne the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> burst, and in which she and her people feel all their dearest interests centred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>At present she has in the field <num value="31000">thirty-one thousand</num> men &mdash; soldiers who have proved their devotion to her by their courage and constancy in the field, and in the endurance of a winter campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>No State can do more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Those who are left are not idle, but devote all their energies to promote the cause of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Arms are being manufactured, and saltpetre, so indispensable to the conduct of the war, is being provided by the establishment of plantations, which the increase of a few months will render prolific &mdash; Everything that can conduce to our success is being initiated, and the future will bring forth good fruit in the earnestness, strength, and devotion of the people of the <rs>State</rs> to the cause nearest their heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> I have made a personal inspection of the lines of defence about being completed around the city, and have to report the almost gratification at the visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>In company with some officers, I made a circuit of a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of works, extending across the country from river to river, all being beautifully profiled and the slopes sodded, the redoubts and bastions strong and commanding, and even the sally-ports admirably built of brick; a work which should forever remain a monument of the perseverance of the people of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and a boulevard for their recreation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I have visited similar works of defence in different parts of the country &mdash; those about <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> especially deserve commendation; but none have been executed more skillfully, none have the same command, and, I may add, few had the same amount of difficulty to over come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The engineer who has carried out the work deserves great commendation for the result which he has produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Should the enemy ever come near enough to see this frowning line of defence, I venture to say that his courage will fall him at the eventful moment, or he will be decimated in an assault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> On my return towards the city, I visited the camp of the <orgName n="Lafayette Artillery" type="artillery">Lafayette Artillery</orgName>, <persName n="Kanapaux,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Kanapaux,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt</roleName> <surname>Kanapaux</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>A company which will, on the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="2">25th</day></dateStruct>, celebrate its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> centennial anniversary whose organization has never passed into that of any other, and which formed during the war of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, now steps forward to contend for their rights in this the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> war of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The company is in possession of a complete battery of beautiful guns and howitzers, and are now engaged in drilling their horses for the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>I had the pleasure of witnessing the inspection parade, and was much pleased at the efficiency which was manifested; a good test of the qualities of the officers, all of whom are men of steering worth, possessing the confidence of the men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> In company with <persName n="O'Connor,Lieutenant-1,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:O'Connor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-1">1st Lieut.</roleName> <surname>O'Connor</surname></persName>, I made an inspection of the quarters of the men, and after <num value="0.5">a half</num> hour's intercourse, in which the enlivening glass passed frequently, I returned to the city much pleased with the visit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> Through the courtesy of friends in the garrison of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and by the removal of the strict injunction against visitors by <persName n="Ripley,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Ripley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName>, I was enabled to visit the fort and view the great changes which the year has produced since he memorable bombardment, which we shall soon celebrate with becoming honors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Every part looks as well prepared for a strong defence as when <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,J.,R.,,"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> defiantly held the post; the exterior appears as new as on the day before the fire opened upon it, the casemates are completed, the barracks rebuilt, and all evidences of the great flee, save in a portion of the officers' quarters not reconstructed, has entirely disappeared.--From the ramparts nothing can be seen of the once formidable batteries of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>, which have been entirely levelled, and at Fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/><persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Wm,,,:2"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> only the shade of the <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName> remains, for its strength has been shorn from it, the guns being dismounted, and the iron stripped from its mailed front. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Following the horizon in my survey, I can readily distinguish the black hulls of <num value="5">five</num> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> blockaders, each commanding an important outlet over the bar; but, despite which, our gallant and adventurous sailors pass out without fear and without molestation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>They have lately added a saucy little craft of light draft, which is found every morning close under <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName>, near the beach channel, and frequently runs close in on the bar, as if bidding defiance to us. --They know not how often they are laughed at within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of their guns, when the moon is veiled and a dark pall covers the face of the deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Pursuing the survey, we come to <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, which looks much more pleasantly then when watching with grim satisfaction the once beleaguered <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Between lie the rafts which are designed to arrest the progress of any audacious gunboat, and bring it under the fire of the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Further in, appears above the water the long line of piles driven across the main channel, upon the verge of which, and within <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> of a passing ship, a new battery has been commenced upon a <unclear></unclear> which will soon be able to give the <name>Lincolnites</name> additional cause of regret at having penetrated to our inner harbor, if they should ever be <unclear>bol</unclear> enough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Of the movements for the construction of the gunboat, I shall not speak <unclear>ti</unclear> office it to say, that the work has been begun, and when it is completed will add greatly to the strength of the fortress which now commands the harbor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> The good news of the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs> arrived here yesterday through the modest, brief, but comprehensive, dispatch of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>All the city is gay with banners, the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> office has given to the breeze the flag of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and all are exultant over a victory to which our <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> has so materially contributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The devotion and love of our people for this distinguished officer is on the increase, and all look confidently to the good star which guides him to lead to yet greater honors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> Our hearts are saddened by the loss of the gallant <rs>Johnston</rs>, than whom no man deserved more the love and confidence of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>But he fell where the noble prefer to die &mdash; on the battle-field which has secured the rights and liberties of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>May the battle-field of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> be a favorable omen of the coming of the deliverance of our people, as it is the name of the hope of the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> of old Bethel Manassas, and <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>!--names which deserve to be engraved on every heart, and from which we can draw comfort; for on each field we won, by Almighty power, a signal and glorious victory.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>There is nothing easier than to exaggerate the force of armies to the field at a given point or on a particular line of invasion or defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The highest reasonably authenticated estimate of the whole force of the rebels is about <num value="230000">230,000</num>, or <num value="350">350</num> regiments of about <num value="700">700</num> effective rank and file each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/><num value="1">One</num> of our morning contemporaries, of yesterday, accepts this estimate, and renders a schedule by States of the different regiments; yet another morning journal peaked with all confidence of <num value="150000">150,000</num> or <unclear><num value="80000">80,000</num></unclear> under <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Lee</surname></persName> behind the <placeName reg="Rappahannock river, Virginia" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock, in Virginia</placeName>, alone; while and her estimate of <num value="120000">120,000</num> at <placeName reg="Corinth, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,7017649">Corinth, in Mississippi</placeName>, is currently spoken of as the force concentrated for a general engagement with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and Bued in that quarter. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Times"></bibl></cit>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> That is the grand problem which at present is agitating the <rs>Northern</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They have bought an elephant and do not know what to do with it. They bought it some centuries ago en the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, and sold it to their Southern brethren to feed and keep, and the elephant has waxed fat and mighty, and interested to great droves of elephants, whose ivory is of incalculable value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The <rs>North</rs> is new seeking to reclaim the elephant, but the great bother is what to do with him.--That is the problem of the day, and it is more puzzling even than to subjugate <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of freemen and teach them to be docile and to obey and love their conquerors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> In this <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> raid on a grand scale, there has been a magnificent amount of rainbow rhetoric and volcanic passion on the subject of the <name>Genius</name> of Universal Emancipation; but when the practical question of &#x0022;What to do with <persName><foreName>Sambo</foreName></persName>?&#x0022; comes to be worked eat, the lines of the rainbow disappear, and the volplane becomes as dry as a doggery under the operation of martial law.--What to do with <persName><foreName>Sambo</foreName></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>That is the great question which even the invincible Fuss and Feathers cannot solve, nor <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> travel with their puissant swords, nor the ghost of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, which has been &#x0022;marching on, marching on, &#x0022; for such a considerable length of time, stop to give any explanation of. For <persName><foreName>Sambo</foreName></persName> is not an abstraction, nor is there much about him that is metaphysical, but he is of the earth, earthy; he is a corporeal being, delighting much in corn, cabbage, and bacon, things which to him are essential and inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>In his present state of servitude he is, as every <num value="1">one</num> gees, not so much a being who pines for liberty as a well-fed ox, who performs a respectable amount of labor, and who knoweth his master's crib.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The eye of every man gees that he is as fat and shining as he is sable, and all who know him can testify that freedom from work is his highest conception of freedom or happiness of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>It happens, therefore, that, in many instances where the <rs>Northern</rs> invasion has reached large settlements of Sumbo, whole congregations of that color have at once voted themselves exemption from the curse of <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName>, and accepted the particular kind of liberation which they supposed the <rs>North</rs> was about to give them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>To imagine that each head of an <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> family is in such a hurry to begin that kind of work which is necessary for the support of his whole establishment, and which most white men find a painful and difficult process, is to do injustice at once to their understanding and their character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The vague idea glimmers through the opaque atmosphere of Negrodom that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, whose reign seems to be a reign of loafers, has sent a large army to save their race from the necessity of any longer working for their living; and, therefore, though not having much respect for him, many of them conclude to become contrabands of both war and peace, and not to be employed on any purpose for any consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>As soon as they discover their mistake, they make their way back to their masters, if they can, with some experience enlightening their lives, and a lively idea that the hardest kind of work a negro can ever perform is what the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> call freedom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> But, &#x0022;what to do with him,&#x0022; is the great question for all Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>We have seen it suggested of late, by a Northern journal, that these contrabands are to be sent to <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, where, in the warm shoe-rooms, of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> manufacturers, which manufacture so much shoe leather and corruption, they may become artizans and mechanics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>It is not stated how the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mechanics are to be induced to create the vacuum into which the skilled labor of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> is to be introduced, nor how <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> will like to become a free-negro Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Others talk of a colony for them, somewhere in the tropics, where the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which is flush of funds, can transport them by <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and leave them to perish gradually from improvidence and want, as all similar colonies have become gradually extinct in all parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>As <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> cannot support them, and the <rs>Western States</rs> refuse positively to have them within their borders on any terms, it would seem that the only alternative is this plan of abolishing them by colonization, which, however, is se costly and onerous a process that it may as well be set down at once as impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>There is positively no solution of the problem except the continuance of the <hi rend="italics">status quo</hi>--the perpetuation of slavery in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>We defy and dare the <rs>Lincoln</rs> despotism to carry out this Wide-Awake programme, on the strength of which it came into power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Without giving them credit for any more conservatism than Jonathan Wild, or humanity than Robespierre, we challenge them to displace the corner-stone of our Southern institutions, or a single pillar that upholds the edifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/><placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName>, which has fed the infernal fires of their fanaticism, and <name>British</name> pulley, whish, for its own selfish purposes, has heaped fuel upon the flames, will never be able in this world again to make <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle an abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>He has already involved himself in debt to the tune of about <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> for the purpose of preserving certain products of the <rs>Southern</rs> soil, which can never be cultivated except by Southern slave labor, and, therefore, for the sake of his own precious pockets and pelf, the negro, in the event of Northern conquest, will have to work harder than he ever did before, in order to support himself, his master, and to pay off the enormous debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It is only to be hoped, for the rakes of the poor negro, as well as for the <rs>Southern</rs> proprietor, that he will be permitted to remain under the beneficent dominion which has been so beneficial to him in body and soul, and not transferred to the hands of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> owners, who will treat him as badly as they do their own sailors, and drive him to madness and destruction by cruelty and oppression. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> The late <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs> evinced in a remarkable degree the capacity of even raw Southern recruits to contest the field with the veteran troops and the best soldiers of the <rs>Northern</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The Western forces of that army are composed of the very flower of their military strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>They are not the effete debauches and desperate adventurers of the <rs>Northern</rs> cities, but the hardy dwellers of the <rs>Western</rs> forest, and the athlete farmers of the <rs type="place">Ohio valley</rs> &mdash; men who are accustomed from their childhood to the gun and horse, to peril, labor, and exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>An army composed of men like this, and enjoying the advantages of long and thorough drill and discipline, and the most approved weapons of modern warfare, has been met and routed, and their arms taken from them, by raw levies, whose strength consisted in their burning patriotism and devotion to principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Without training, and with weapons which have been the mirth and mockery of their enemies, they have hurried themselves with irresistible sodrage and energy upon the boasted invincible of the <rs>West</rs>, and demonstrated the ability of the <rs>South</rs>, even without military discipline, to retrieve her recent disasters and to roll back the tide of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>With the example of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> before the <rs>South</rs>, the <rs>North</rs> has everything to year, and the <rs>South</rs> everything to hope, in the capability of our people for vindicating their independence. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/> It would seem that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are much more closely blockaded by land than by sea. They can import arms; they could if they would export cotton and tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>But that which used to come to us overland, through the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, has not yet found a safe channel for itself &mdash; Letters and newspapers seem but rarely to run the blockade, and we are left with comparatively little information as to the condition of Southern affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>What we receive through the <rs>North</rs> is so untruthful and so willfully perverted as to be worse than none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Strict precautions have been taken to prevent unpleasant truths from reaching the cars of the <rs>Northern</rs> people or of foreign readers of Northern newspapers.--Nothing can be published by these organs without the permission of <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00281" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, who has caused military possession to be taken of the various lines of telegraph, and has made use of very effective means of terrorism, exclusion from the mails, prosecutions before servile tribunals, and the severities of club law, in order to check the publication of any obnoxious reports which the editors may receive through such channels as cannot be closed in a similar manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Consequently the <rs>Northern</rs> press has a monopoly of falsehood, and the independent journals are wholly stopped from contradiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>We may not, therefore, place the least reliance on any statement relative to the situation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the policy of their Government or the feelings of their people, which rest on the authority of the <rs>Northern</rs> journals or the partizans of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The utmost pains are taken, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to preclude them from knowing the truth; and, secondly, to deter them from speaking it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The exigencies of the struggle had a sobering effect upon the journals and statement of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and they are too hard at work and too much in earnest for falsehood and braggadocio. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>The <rs>Senators</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> generally, its representatives almost invariably, have been demagogues, intriguers, or nobodies; those of the <rs>South</rs> have been more frequently statement and gentleman.
