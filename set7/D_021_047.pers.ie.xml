<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> <hi rend="italics">Follow-Citizens</hi> On this, the birth-day of the man most identified with the establishment of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> independence, and beneath the monument erected to commemorate his heroic virtues and those of his compatriots, we have assembled to usher into existence the permanent Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Through the instrumentality, under the favor of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, we hope to perpetuate the principles of our Revolutionary Fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The day, the memory' and the purpose, seem fitly associated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> It is with mingled feelings of humility and pride that I appear to take, in the presence of the people and before high Heaven, the oath prescribed as a qualification for the exalted nation to which the unanimous voice of the people has called me. Deeply sensible of all that is implied by this manifestation of the people's confidence, I am yet more profoundly impressed by the vast responsibility of the office, and humbly feel my own unworthiness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> In return for their kindness, I can only offer assurances of the gratitude with which it is received, and can but pledge a zealous devotion of every faculty to the service of those who have chosen me as their <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> When a long course of class legislation, directed not to the general welfare, but to the aggrandizement of the <rs>Northern</rs> section of the <rs>Union</rs>, culminated in a warfare on the domestic institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs>; when the dogmas of a sectional party, substituted for the provisions of the constitutional compact, threatened to destroy the sovereign rights of the <name>States</name>, <num value="6">six</num> of those States, withdrawing from the <rs>Union</rs>, confederated together, to exercise the right and perform the duty of instituting a Government which would better secure the liberties, for the preservation of which that Union was established. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Whatever of hope some may have entertained that a returning sense of justice would remove the danger with which our rights were threatened, and render it possible to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, must have been dispelled by the malignity and barbarity of the <rs>Northern States</rs> in the prosecution of the existing war. The confidence of the most hopeful among us must have been destroyed by the disregard they have recently exhibited for all the time-honored bulwarks of civil and religious liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Bastiles filled with prisoners, arrested without civil process, or indictment duly found; the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> suspended by Executive mandate a <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName> controlled by the imprisonment of members whose avowed principles suggested to the <rs>Federal Executive</rs> that there might be another added to the list of seceded States; elections held under threats of a military power; <rs type="role" reg="civil-Officer">civil officers</rs>, peaceful citizens, and gentle women incarcerated for opinion's sake, proclaimed the incapacity of our late associates to administer a government as free, liberal, and humane as that established for our common use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> For proof of the sincerity of our purpose to maintain our ancient institutions, we may point to the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and the laws enacted under it, as well as to the fact that through all the necessities of an unequal struggle, there has been no act on our part to impair personal liberty or the freedom of speech, of thought or of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <rs type="place">Courts</rs> have been open; the judicial functions fully executed, and every right of the peaceful citizen maintained as securely as if a war of invasion had not disturbed the land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The people of the <name>States</name> now confederated became convinced that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had fallen into the hands of a sectional majority who would pervert that most sacred of all trusts to the destruction of the rights which it was pledged to protect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They believed that to remain longer in the <rs>Union</rs> would subject them to a continuance of a disparaging discrimination, submission to which would be inconsistent with their welfare, and intolerable to a proud people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They therefore determined to sever its bonds, and establish a new Confederacy for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>(Cheers.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The experiment instituted by our revolutionary fathers of a voluntary union of sovereign States for purposes specified in a solemn impact, had been perverted by those, who feeling power and forgetting right, were determined to respect no law but their own will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The Government has ceased to answer the ends for which it was ordained, and established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>To save ourselves from a revolution, which in its silent but rapid progress was about to place us under the despotism of numbers and to preserve in spirit as well as inform, a system of government, we believed to be peculiarly fitted to our condition and full of promise for mankind, we determined to take a new association composed of States homogeneous in interest, in policy and in <unclear>ing</unclear> (Cheers.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> True to our traditions of peace and our love of justice, we sent Commissioners to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to propose a fair and amicable settlement of all questions of public debt or property which might be in dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, denying our right to self-government, refused even to listen to any proposals for a peaceful separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Nothing was then left to us but to prepare for war. (Cheers.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year in our history has been the most eventful in the annals of this Continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>A new Government has been established, and its machinery put in operation over an area exceeding <num value="700000">700,000</num> square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The great principles upon which we have been willing to hazard everything that is dear to man, have made conquests for us which could never have been achieved by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Our Confederacy has grown from <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, already united to us by hallowed memories and material interests, will, I believe, when able to speak with unsifted voice, connect her destiny with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>(Great applause). Our people have rallied with unexampled unanimity to the support of the great principles of constitutional government, with firm resolve to perpetuate by arms the rights which they could not peacefully secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>A <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, it is estimated, are now standing in hostile array, and waging war along a frontier of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of miles; battles have been fought; sieges have been conducted, and, although the contest is not ended, and the tide for the moment is against us, the final result in our favor is not doubtful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The period is near at hand when our foes must sink under the immense load of debt which they have incurred; a debt which in their effort to subjugate us has already attained such fearful dimensions as will subject them to burthens which must continue to oppress them for generations to come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> We, too, have had our trials and difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>That we are to escape them in future is not to be hoped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It was to be expected when we entered upon this war that it would expose our people to sacrifices and cost them much, with of money and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But we knew the value of the object for which we struggled, and understood the nature of the war in which we were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Nothing could be so bad as failure, and any sacrifice would be cheap as the price of success in such a contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>(Cheers.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> But the picture has its lights as well as its shadows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>This great strite has awakened in the people the highest emotions and qualities of the human soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is cultivating feelings of patriotism, virtue, and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Instances of self-sacrifice, and of generous devotion to the noble cause for which we are contending, are life throughout the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Never has a people evinced a more determined spirit than that now animating men, women, and children in every part of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Upon the last call the men fly to arms; and wives and mothers send their husbands and sons to battle, without a murmur of regret. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> It was, perhaps, in the ordination of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that we were to be taught the value of our liberties by the price which we pay for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The recollections of this great contest with all its common traditions of glory, of sacrifice, and of blood will be the bound of harmony, and enduring affection amongst the people, producing unity in policy, fraternity is sentiment, and joint effort in war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Nor have the material sacrifices of the past year been made without some corresponding benefits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>If the acquiescence of foreign nations in a pretended blockade has deprived us of our commerce with them, it is last making us a self supporting and an independent people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The blockade, if effectual and permanent, could only serve to divert our industry from the prostration of articles for export, and employ it in supplying commodities for domestic use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> It is a satisfaction that we have maintained the war by our unaided exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We have neither asked nor received assistance from </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Yet the interest involved is not wholly our own. The world at large is concerned in opening our markets to its commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>When the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is recognized by the nations of the earth, and we are free to follow our interests and inclinations by cultivating foreign trade the <rs>Southern States</rs> will offer to manufacturing nations the most favorable markets which ever invited their commerce, Cotton, sugar, rice, tobacco, provisions, timber, and naval stores will furnish attractive exchanges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Nor would the consistency of these supplies be likely to be disturbed by war. Our Confederate strength will be too great to tempt aggression, and never was there a people whose interests and principles committed them so fully to a peaceful policy as those of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>By the character of their productions they are too deeply interested in foreign commerce wantonly to disturb it. War of conquest they cannot wage, because the <rs>Constitution</rs> of their Confederacy admits of no coerced association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Civil war there cannot be between States held together by their volition only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>This rule of voluntary association, which cannot fall to be conservative, by securing just and impartial Government at home, does not diminish the security of the obligations by which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> may be bound to foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>In proof of this, it is to be remembered that at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of asserting their right of secession, these States proposed a settlement on the basis of a common liability for the obligations of the <rs>General Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Fellow-citizens, after the struggles of ages had consecrated the right of the <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> to Constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Representative Government, our colonial ancestors were forced to vindicate that birthright by an appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Success crowned their efforts, and they provided for their posterity a peaceful remedy against future aggression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The tyranny of an unbridled majority, the most odious, and least responsible form of despotism has denied us both the right and the remedy; therefore, we are in arms to renew such sacrifices as our fathers made to the holy cause of Constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>At the darkest hour of our struggle the <name>Provisional</name> gives place to the <rs>Permanent Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>After a series of successes and victories, which covered our arms with glory, we have recently met with serious disasters.--But in the heart of a people resolved to be free, these disasters tend but to stimulate to increased resistance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> To show ourselves worthy of the inheritance bequeathed to us by the patriots of the <name>Revolution</name>, we must emulate that heroic devotion which made reverse to them but the crucible in which their patriotism was refluxed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> With confidence in the wisdom and virtue of those who will share with me the responsibility, and aid me in the conduct of public affairs; securely relying on the patriotism and courage of the people, of which the present war has furnished so many examples, I deeply feel the weight of the responsibilities I now, with unaffected diffidence, am about to assume; and fully realizing the inadequacy of human power to guide and to sustain, my hope is reverently fixed on Him whose favor is ever vouchsafed to the cause which is just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>With humble gratitude and adoration, acknowledging the <rs>Providence</rs> which has so visibly protected the <rs>Confederacy</rs> during its brief, out eventful career, to Thee, Oh <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I trustingly commit myself, and prayerfully invoke Thy blessing on my country and its cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> In the <unclear></unclear> of definite information on the subject, we take it for granted that the evacuation of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> was occasioned by the want of such fortifications and forces as would be entirely reliable to resist an assault by the large Northern army, aided by the iron and gunboats, which, with the present high waters, could easily ascend the <rs>Cumberland</rs> to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>There gunboats co-operating with the <rs>Federal</rs> land forces, give our enemy an immense advantage, and our General no doubt consider the present not the time to repeat disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The evacuation of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> under these circumstances has been regarded here for some days as an event consequent upon the full of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, which opened the <rs>Cumberland</rs> to the gunboats up to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Even if the enemy gave notice to women and children to leave the place, a large portion of those in a city like <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> would be unable to do so. It was therefore a dictate of humanity, as well as prudence, to abandon a town under the circumstance, which our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> had not the certain means to defend. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> That the loss of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> is mortifying no <num value="1">one</num> will deny, but its fate was inevitable after the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/> I noticed in your issue of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="02-15">Feb. 15th,</date> some remarks from <num value="1">one</num> of the members of the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName>, upon the subject of the reduction of the pay of officers engaged in this war, and the advance of the pay of privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>It is true the necessities of many of the latter, in our ranks require an increase of pay, still it should remain as it is, (for the sake of our glorious cause,) unless that of the officers be reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>We have patriotism enough, I trust, to make us willing to serve in our Southern cause, with our present pay, or even less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Still such exertions in behalf of privates deserve our praise, and more so, as coming from a body, whose every action has heretofore been for their own individual comfort and case, being willing to remain at home, (or in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,) spending our money, discussing means to exempt themselves from serving their country, and quietly view those more loyal than they go forward and gain an independence, and they, because, forsooth, they are legislators, cannot go to the field of battle, and thus endanger their valuable lives; yet when the noble work is done, and the dastardly foe driven from our sunny South, who will be more clamorous than they, in claiming that <hi rend="italics">we</hi> have fought and conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Many of them were foremost in the ranks of secession last spring, and were calling upon all to rally to the standard of liberty, but now are shrinking from duty, and screening themselves behind an office that does not interfere with their known duty to an outraged country.--Many of our brave volunteers are deterred from again entering the ranks because the leaders have now become followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>It is a lasting shame in times like these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Why not exempt those who are engaged in raising insistence for the army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>They were the ones, (if any be exempt,) and not the lawyers who compose the <name>Legislature</name>, with a few honorable exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Then rally to your country's call, all who are now in service, and show <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> legislators that there remains in the noble old State men who are willing to sacrifice case and comfort for the sake of liberty; and when our sacred soil is polluted by the tread of a tyrant's foot, let every son be willing to avenge a mother's wrongs; and when we think of the noble sacrifice which was offered upon the altar at <placeName reg="Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia" key="tgn,7014343">Roanoke</placeName>, may it prove an incentive to urge us to action, and may we be willing to imperil our lives in defence of a cause so full of interest to us all. Remember the boasts of our insulting foe, and show to him and all he has mistaken the men he has to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Remember our victories and our losses, and may it nerve our hearts to greater struggles for independence and freedom. </p> <closer> <signed><rs type="role2">Private</rs>.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>
