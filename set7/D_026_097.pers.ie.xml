<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The plants of most rapid growth are the soonest to decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If we had achieved our liberties with case we should have parted from them without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We should have valued our independence at the price it cost us, and if we had gained it after the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs>, have been by this time on the road to reconstruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> If there is a nation on the face of the earth which ever obtained permanent independence after a short war, we know not where to look for its history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We cannot make ourselves a new people in a day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> The war has disclosed to us the true character and purposes of the people from whom we have separated, and in that disclosure has produced its unanswerable justification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It has also made known to us our own strength and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We are acquiring that self dependence which is the only guarantee of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The real or affected incredulity of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journalists and orators that the <rs>South</rs> can ever be separated from the <rs>North</rs> is not greater than that which was entertained by the <rs>English</rs> people in regard to the separation of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies from the mother country.

I have very often heard old persons describe the impossibility of making any <num value="1">one</num> believe that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies could ever be separated from this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was always considered as an idle dream of discontented politicians, good enough to fill up the periods of a speech, but which no practical man, devoid of the spirit of party, considered to be within the limits of possibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>There was a period when the slightest concession would have satisfied the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>; but all the world was in heroics; <num value="1">one</num> set of gentlemen met at the <name>Lamb</name>, and another at the <rs>Lion</rs>; blood and treasure men, breathing war and vengeance and contempt; and in <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> afterwards an awkward looking gentleman, in plain cloth, walked up to the drawing room of <placeName key="tgn,2060347" n="1.000 2" reg="saint james, phelps, missouri">St. James</placeName>'s, in the midst of the gentlemen of the <rs>Lion</rs> and <rs>Lamb</rs>, and was introduced as the <hi rend="italics">Ambassador from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>.</hi>&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The oath which the accused had taken was an oath of parole, and the charge against the prisoner seems to have been disloyalty in his feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In a late copy of &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">The New Regime.</hi>&#x0022; published at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, we find a report of a subsequent examination of <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> A. by the <name>Beast</name> in person at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>We give it as a part of the history of the times: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Now I need not say to a man as experienced as yourself, that taking the oath of allegiance is only a manifestation of loyalty that as a man might join your church and still be a very had man after so doing, so a man may take the oath of allegiance and still be a very disloyal man. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Rev Mr. A &mdash; If you will allow me to make a state meat to you I will do so, or I will answer such questions as you please. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> A &mdash; The view with which I took the oath was this: I believe the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commander</rs> has a right to demand of the citizens at any time that they shall take a parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I regard <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> as for the present a conquered city; indeed, I have had no idea that the <rs>Confederates</rs> would again take it, and that if it ever again did become a part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, it would be by treaty at the end of the war. I wished, in accordance with the scriptural injunctions, to &#x0022;obey the powers that be,&#x0022; and I believe the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to be &#x0022;the powers that be. &#x0022;I took the oath with the intention of keeping it so far as my actions were concerned.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> A.--I talked with her. I don't recollect what I said.

<head>Northern sectionalism.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> The signs of the outbreaking of sectional sentiments at the <rs>North</rs> are increasing of late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Not long ago we had a lively demonstration from the <rs>Northwestern</rs> press touching some plans of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> for keeping her citizens out of the war, and making all the money she could by Government contracts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> The shrewd fanatic at the head of the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive department</orgName> of the <rs type="place">Bay</rs> State coolly suggested to the <name>Legislature</name> that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> had furnished about as many men for the field as could be expected of her; that those now at home were needed to conduct the manufactories so indispensable to the army &mdash; its clothing and its arming &mdash; and that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> ought therefore to let her off. This man&#x00E6;uvre excited the ire of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, and her press descanted upon it most freely and severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The cunning and cupidity of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> were re-enlisted in no very select or polite language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>She was charged with the most self <unclear>h</unclear> motives and the most unscrupulous arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>She was represented as making everything out of the war, while the <rs>Northwest</rs> did the <unclear>ghting,</unclear> and was reduced almost to ruin in all her interests by the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The truth of the allegations added to their bitterness, and it was plain that <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> was provoking an enemy in the <rs>Northwest</rs> that was not loth to join issue with it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> There have been many signs of this sectionalism &mdash; this impatience of the predominance of puritanism and fanaticism in the federal Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>But the latest is <num value="1">one</num> which occurred in the <rs type="place">House</rs> of <rs type="role" reg="Representative">Representative</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> the other day. <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> <unclear></unclear> of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, moved the abolition of the fishing bounties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>This raised the whole of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and there was a marry time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>We have already published the debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> P. charged that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> monopolized everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Out of <num value="12">twelve</num> senators <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> had <hi rend="italics"><num value="14">fourteen</num></hi> chairman of committees, and with this example <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> It was easy to see how the country was taxed for her benefit ! He said it was as just to tax the pigs of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, or the power mills of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, as that the <rs>West</rs> should be taxed to pay these fishing bounties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The debate became personal, and <persName n="Powell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Powell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Powell</surname></persName> was called a friend to traitors by <persName n="Chandler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Chandler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chandler</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, (a native of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>)--<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> P. charged him with falsehood, and each declared he had no respect for the other.--It was at this juncture that <persName n="Saulsbury,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Saulsbury,nomatch:0"><surname>Saulsbury</surname></persName>, of <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Del</rs>., with admirable irony, (for such, no doubt, it was,) &#x0022;appealed to the <rs>Senators</rs>, that as sons of common sires (very common!) and as brothers, they should, in the present unhappy state of affairs in which the country found itself, act as became the dignity of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> !&#x0022; Capital ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> After the pleasant debate thus aroused by assailing <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>'s interest, the vote was taken, and the motion to repeal the bounties failed by a tie vote--<num value="19">19</num> to <num value="19">19</num> ! This is certainly most remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>When the <rs>South</rs> was in the <rs>Union</rs>, and paid most of the taxes, the <rs>West</rs> thought nothing of these bounties to the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> fisheries, and would not help to repeal them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>But now that the <rs>South</rs> is out and the burthen falls on the agricultural <rs>West</rs>, that <name>West</name> demands their repeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Well, they ought in justice to be repealed, but it would not be an unmerited punishment to hold the <rs>West</rs> a few years to the task of paying these bounties while groaning under the war &mdash; the war waged by <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and into which the <rs>West</rs> permitted itself to be drawn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> By and by we shall see more and yet stronger signs of impatience of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> yoke in the <rs>Northwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>There is no community of interest between the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> proper and the <rs>Western</rs> people, and of course no real community of feeling and sentiment. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
