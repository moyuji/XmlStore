<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The batteries on the long line of bluff, but a moment before silent as the church yard, now resound to the hurrying tread of men while the quick, stern tones of command are heard above the awful din, and the furtively glancing rays of light from the battle lanterns reveal the huge instruments of death and destruction, and show the half-covered way to magazines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> Rotying greatly upon the suddenness and vigor of their attack to disconcert and confuse the defenders of our cliffs the roar of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discharge had not died away upon the car before it recommenced; and then the quick and irregular, but unceasing volleys and broadsides showed that the crew of each <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gun were firing with each other in colority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The sheets of flames that poured from the sides of the sloops at each discharge lit up nearly the whole stretch of river, placing each craft in strong relief against the black sky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> Minute after minute passed away, each driven to eternity distracted by the maddening roar of so many cannon, and the fleet kept up its unchecked course up the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Amazement seized upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers and men. Where were the long-talked of batteries the rebels had been constructing with which to hold the <rs>Mississippi</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Had they been abandoned in a panic caused by the terrible bombardment of the fleet?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The marine officer of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> (now a prisoner) tells me the query was seriously propounded whether the rebels had not evacuated their stronghold and thus cheated the &#x0022;brave <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> tars&#x0022; out of the glory they were expecting to reap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Only too soon did the enemy discover that they were but waiting to bring their whole fleet irretrievably under our guns before they went to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>This was the monitor, and stones the enemy saw a cordon of vivid light as long as their own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Now commenced the battle in all its terrible earnestness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Outnumbered in guns, and outweighed in metal, our vollies were as quickly repeated, and the majority of them unsering in their aim. --As soon as the enemy that discovered our batteries they opened on them with grasp and canister, which was more accurately thrown than their shells and threw clouds of dirt upon the guns and gunners; the shells went over them in every conceivable direction, except the right <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The <rs>Hartford</rs>, a very fast ship, now made straight for up the river, making the best time, and trying to divers the aim of our gunners by her incessant and deafening broadsides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>She soon outstripped the balance of the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Shot after shot struck her, riddling her through and through but still she kept on her way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> Every craft now looking out for itself and bound to make its very best time to get by, the fleet lost its orderly line of battle, and got so mixed up it was difficult and sometimes impossible, to distinguish <num value="1">one</num> from another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It was speedily apparent to the enemy that the fire was a great deal hotter and more destructive than had been expected, and the captains of the <num value="2">two</num> gunboats and of the <rs>Monongahela</rs> doubtless resolved quickly that it would be madness to attempt to run such a terrific gauntlet of iron hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Whether the commanders of the <rs>Richmond</rs> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> had already arrived at the same determination, or came to it soon after, is not known, but they all except the <rs>Hartford</rs>, undertook to put about and return the way they came. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> For this purpose the <rs>Richmond</rs> sheered close into the left bank, under the batteries, and then circled round, her course reaching nearly up to the opposite point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>In executing this man&#x0153;uvre she gave our batteries successively a raking position, and they took excellent advantage of it, ripping her from stern to stern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>From the crashing of timbers plainly heard during every brief interval of the din and from the view had of shots that struck her, it was evident that her doom was sealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Instead of making a run for it down the river, hugging the opposite shore, she again turned her prow towards our batteries and run right in under them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>As she got this position a voice from on board of her cried out: &#x0027;Now let me see you strike me from those bills G &mdash; d d &mdash; n you!&#x0027; As if an answer to this blasphemous appeal a battery above and below got his range, and while a shell crashed through his force as to a double charge of grape swept his docks from the mizzenmast forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It must have done fearful execution, and the voice which had just before rung out an oath and a defiance now exclaimed in piteous accents: &#x0027;For <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake don't shoot any more!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>We are sinking! &#x0027; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> It was reported among a crowd of observers on the bluff that a voice from her deck had called out: &#x0022;We surrender I we surrender!&#x0022; If this was said it was not probably spoken by her commander, who, however, appealed to our batteries to cease firing upon her as the ship was sinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>As she was evidently drifting down in an unmanageable condition and apparently settling, the batteries let her alone, and turned their attention to other craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Whether or not she sunk, I do not yet know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Her commander may have used a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> artifice to escape by the mistaken humanity of the victors, but if she is not seriously disabled then many an experienced eye was greatly deceived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> <placeName reg="The Mississippi">The Mississippi</placeName> undertook to execute the same man&#x0153;uvre, of turning round and making her escape back to the point she started from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>She had rounded and just turned down stream when <num value="1">one</num> of our shots tore off her rudder, and another went crashing through her machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Immediately after came the rushing sound of steam, escaping from some broken pipe, and the now unmanageable vessel drifted aground directly opposite our crescent line of batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Her range was quickly gained, and she was being rapidly torn to pieces by our missiles when the commander gave the order for all hands to gave themselves the best way they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>At the same time fire broke out in <num value="2">two</num> places.--The prisoners we have taken are of opinion that she was not on fire by her own officers, but it is quite as likely that it was caused by our red hot shot which were being poured into her uninterruptedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>At this time her decks were strewn with dead and wounded, according to <num value="1">one</num> of her crew, with whom I have conversed, who thought that <num value="0.5">one half</num> her compliment of men were included in the list of casualties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> In the meantime, I must account for the other vessels of the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>A vessel, which was either the <name>Genersee</name> or <placeName reg="Monongahela, Washington, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090863">Monongahela</placeName>, most probably the former, slipped by in the confusion, and joined the <rs>Hartford</rs> up the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> Some <num value="55">fifty-five</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> persons saved themselves by jumping overboard and swimming or wading from the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The dead and <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> wounded were left upon the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, which soon fleeted off and started down with the current.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> When the burning <rs>Mississippi</rs> reached the point where the mortar boats and other craft lay, she created a perfect panic among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Probably, from the fear of her magazine exploding among them they speedily cast loose from their moorings and run before her, not making their appearance again until near the hour of noon to day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> That the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> ought to have recognized agents abroad, to watch over and promote their interests and thwart the machinations of their adversaries, is a proposition which admits of no dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>But whether it comports with our dignity or even our interests that we should commission representatives simply to sit at the gates of kings and petition for our admission to the family of nations, is a question of a very different character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The reception which our Commissioners have received socially is satisfactory enough, and if our only object in sending them to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> was to ascertain whether the slice of hospitality would be extended in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to Southern gentlemen, we have no reason to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>But beyond this our Commissioners have met only the most discouraging treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>What earthly influence they are able to exert upon the subject of recognition we should like to be able to perceive.
