<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> How truthfully has this portion of the <rs>Holy Word</rs> been verified: &#x0022;For we know not what a day may bring forth.&#x0022; In my last, dated the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th inst.</day></dateStruct>, I apprised your readers that profound silence reigned along our entire picket lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Nor could I discern at that time the smallest speck, indicating an advance, on the bright horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>All, in the language of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, was painfully quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Since, there has been quite a formidable advance of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>At a very early hour on last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th inst.</day></dateStruct>, your correspondent was informed that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were crossing at <placeName reg="Rixey ford">Rixey</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kelly's Ford, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2112479">Kelly's fords</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Soon after intelligence came that they were crossing at all the fordable points on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> between the <num value="2">two</num> fords mentioned above.--<persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, with his usual vigilance, had not allowed himself to be surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Through his scouts and other sources he had been apprised of the enemy's making preparations to cross the river, and sent orders to officers commanding the different brigades to hold themselves in readiness to meet the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Soon bugles of the various regiments were sounded, and the men sprang into their saddles promptly and dashed off to meet him.--A very heavy column of cavalry, accompanied by several batteries, had crossed the river at <persName n="Kelly,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Kelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Kelly</surname></persName>'s, and was marching cautiously on the road leading from this ford to Brandy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They had met with very little resistance until they reached this point, having no force to contend with save that of pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Here the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 6">6th</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 12">12th regiments</orgName> skirmished with them for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They were finally driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><persName n="Lomax,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lomax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lomax</surname></persName> reinforced the above regiments promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Another engagement immediately ensued, in which the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> and <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> participated largely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Both fought splendidly; the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> has long since won a glorious name for prowess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But with all the valor evinced, the overwhelming column of the enemy could not be checked, our cavalry retiring slowly until it reached <placeName reg="Mountain Run, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,2528029">Mountain Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Here a squadron of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> made a bold charge and drove the enemy back a short distance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> It was here we lost <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery that had been placed in position to hold a ford below the railroad bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The regiment that had been placed in supporting distance of this artillery changed its position through a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>A portion of the enemy's cavalry swept around, under cover of a hill and out of view, until they got within a very short distance, when they charged and took it. About the same time another gun was captured by a very rapid flank movement on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>While I regret to record the loss of these guns, I do not believe it could have been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>During the engagement at the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> <persName n="Gordon,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> moved up on the <placeName key="tgn,2114382" n="1.000 36" reg="stevensburg, culpeper, virginia">Stevensburg</placeName> road and attacked the enemy vigorously on his left flank; but, fearing he might greatly cripple his command by prolonging the fight, he retired on the <placeName key="tgn,2113825" n="1.000 35" reg="raccoon ford, culpeper, virginia">Raccoon Ford</placeName> road, the enemy in hot pursuit of him. The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 6">6th regiment</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Flournoy,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Flournoy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Flournoy</surname></persName>, made a very brilliant charge, and succeeded in repulsing the enemy's sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The enemy's cavalry was supported by <orgName n="command"><persName n="Warren,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Warren,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Warren</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> &mdash; the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 12">12th army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The fight continued until twilight, having commenced about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Our loss in killed and wounded will not reach <num value="50">fifty</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He was in his saddle early on yesterday morning, and made a spirited attack on the enemy near <placeName reg="Rapidan Station">Rapidan Station</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The engagement lasted all day. The <orgName type="mil" key="CavArtillery">Horse Artillery</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Beckham,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Beckham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Beckham</surname></persName>, did some terrible execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>I witnessed a number of riders unhorsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>There was skirmishing at <placeName key="tgn,2113825" n="1.000 35" reg="raccoon ford, culpeper, virginia">Raccoon Ford</placeName> on yesterday between our cavalry and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I hear of but few casualties on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I omitted to mention the wounding of <persName n="Beale,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Beale,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Beale</surname></persName> early in the action on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. The wound is not supposed to be dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He was shot through the fleshy part of his leg. Skirmishing is still going on here this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But I am inclined to think this a joint, and that the enemy will cross the <rs>Rapidan</rs> below this point, perhaps at Raccoon or <placeName reg="Germana Fords">Germana Fords</placeName>.
