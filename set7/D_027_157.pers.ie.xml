<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The British Emancipation Act, passed in <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct>, provided for the liberation of about <num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> slaves in <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> from the passage of the act. The sum appropriated for the compensation of the proprietors was <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of pounds sterling, or not half the value of the slave, and in many instances not <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>From the date of that act the agricultural produce of the island gradually disappeared, until it became a wilderness in comparison with its former fertility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The planters never received anything but the interest of the <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>; and their once garden like estates have returned, like the negroes, to the freedom of nature. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The island of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>, before the emancipation of the negroes, produced <measure n="700000000l." type="pounds"><num value="700000000">seven hundred millions</num> pounds</measure> of sugar, being more than all the rest of the world put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>After emancipation, it was compelled to <hi rend="italics">import</hi> that article.--Let us hear <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>: &#x0022;Had any of your philosophic Liberals come out to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> to proclaim liberty to the blacks or the <name>Arabs</name>, I would have hung him up to the mast-head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, similar enthusiasts have delivered over the whites to the ferocity of the blacks; and yet they complain of the victims of such madness being discontented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>How is it possible to give liberty to <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> when they are destitute of any species of civilization, and ignorant even of what a colony or mother country is?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Do you suppose that, had they been aware of what they were doing, they would have given liberty to the blacks?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Certainly not; but few persons at that time were sufficiently far-sighted to foresee the results; and feelings of humanity are ever powerful with excited imaginations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But now, after the experience we have had, to maintain the same principles cannot be done in good faith; it can be the result only of overweening self-confidence or hypocrisy.&#x0022; Yet the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with all this experience before its eyes, is frantic for the immediate abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It will not even accord the <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> of apprenticeship permitted by the <rs>British Emancipation Act</rs>, although it required <measure n="500years" type="date">five hundred years</measure> to wear out <hi rend="italics">white</hi> slavery in the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896">British islands</placeName> and render the transition from servitude to liberty safe and salutary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> can be clothed with the habits and desires of a freeman by a simple act of immediate and unconditional liberation! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> In the palmy days of her <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> transferred above <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> negroes to this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, which is believed to be the most extraordinary example in the history of mankind of so considerable a removal from <num value="1">one</num> part of the world <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>, having turned philanthropist, she put a peremptory stop to the slave trade; notwithstanding which, the slave trade became doubled in extent and quadrupled in horrors!--Whilst the agricultural produce of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">British West Indies</placeName> rapidly declined, those colonies of other nations which still retained slave labor received an impetus of prosperity which is almost incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><placeName reg="Puerto Rico" key="tgn,7004643">Puerto Rico</placeName>, which <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> before only exported cattle and coffee and imported sugar, exported, in a short period after the passage of the <rs>British Emancipation Act</rs>, more than a <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> of the whole <name>British</name> consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The increase of the sugar exportation from <placeName reg="Cuba" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> and <placeName reg="Brasil" key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName> was equally marked and wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This prodigious increase was the result of the emancipation madness of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and was, of course, only obtained by a vast increase in the importation of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The whole history of mankind proves that slavery is a necessary step in the progress of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Without it, savage man never has worked, and never can be induced to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>For that reason it could not be expected from <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> or <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, nor among our <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> progenitors for <measure n="500years" type="date">five hundred years</measure>; for that reason it still exists over the larger portion of the <rs>Globe</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Whatever evils may be attendant on servitude, they are unimportant in comparison with the total stoppage of the advance and prospects of the human race which would follow universal abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could succeed in the overthrow of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery within our limits, we should have the stern consolation of knowing that it had totally and forever involved its own prosperity and power in the common ruin. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Scarcely a mail arrives from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that does not bring a statement from <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> or <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>, or both, that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> intends to preserve the most rigid neutrality between the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> belligerents, and that, in their opinion, the time for intervention has not yet arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The war has lasted now nearly <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and the same stereotyped missive is constantly crossing the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, until it seems to have become a regular part of the invoice of every steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If it should last <measure n="400years" type="date">four hundred years</measure>, and the <num value="2">two</num> old earls, who seem to have as many lives as a cat, could live so long, we should have the same message to the end of the chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The time for intervention will only arrive when <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> is destroyed, the <name>Revolution</name> of '<num value="76">76</num> avenged, and the only commercial rival of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> swept from the face of the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> These <num value="2">two</num> old gentlemen seem to be putting themselves to a great deal of unnecessary trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>At their time of life, they would better employ themselves in settling their own individual affairs for a future state of existence, and give sublunary, and especially trans-Atlantic things, the go-by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We are not so hopelessly thick-headed as not to comprehend the same statement when it is made a <num value="100">hundred</num> times over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They need not be hurrying their gouty old legs to every steamer and sending over their compliments--&#x0022;rigid neutrality, etc., but not yet time to intervene.&#x0022; They are both very interesting persons; and that intelligence, when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> communicated it, was a very interesting piece of news; but we venture to suggest that the best thing in the world loses by infinite repetition.--Their explication of the position of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is well understood both here and in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as they themselves also are. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> If they expect to keep the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in good humor by the eternally reiterated declaration of their neutrality, they have adopted a singular mode of effecting their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is precisely the recognition of the <rs>South</rs> as a belligerent which has offended the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> past all atonement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> look upon the <rs>South</rs> as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> does upon <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> &mdash; part and parcel of the empire &mdash; and here is <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, exalting her rebellious province to the dignity of a belligerent, and constantly declaring that she will not take sides with either.--It was lately urged in the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>, that, but for the recognition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as a belligerent power, <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and our other cruisers would have been treated by the whole world as pirates, and, consequently, the commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have been safe from harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The speaker <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> therefore proposed that a demand should be made upon <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for all the losses which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce has sustained by Confederate cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The fact that these cruisers are principally British-built and British-manned has led to a prevalent idea in the <rs>North</rs> that they are neither more nor less than <name>British</name> privateers, fitted out with the knowledge of the <rs>British Government</rs> to prey upon <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>This is a very uncharitable notion, we admit; but it none the less exists, and, should the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> fail, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will be called upon to make good all damages to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> merchantmen in this war, and, what is more, she will have to foot the bill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> For, in the event of its success, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will be no longer the same nation that it was when, in the palmy days of that political eunuch, <persName n="Buchanan,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Buchanan,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, <name>English</name> gunboats chased and boarded our own vessels on our own coast, and when <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> twisted the nose and slapped the jaws of <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> as suited his sovereign convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was then like a horse or an ass, that did not know its own strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The exemplary <rs>Buchanan</rs> took kindly every affront put upon his nation, and made many polite bows in recognition of the condescension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>But even if the war had not disclosed to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> its own military capacities, the eagerness of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to avoid a conflict with that power would rouse its valor to a dangerous point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Whilst <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has been seeking, by every indirect means, to do it mischief, she has fondled, like a spaniel, upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, to avoid an open rupture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Such, at least, is the view taken of matters by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> people; and their memory of an injury is remarkably good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Should a consolidated, gigantic military despotism dominate at some future day in this hemisphere, as <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> does in the <rs>East</rs>, &#x0022;our cousins&#x0022; across the <rs>Atlantic</rs> can reflect at their leisure upon the fruits of <name>British</name> neutrality. &#x0022;In that event, the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName> might as well execute a quit-claim deed to all its possessions on this continent and bid good-bye to its dominion of the seas. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>It is kept in a large cage, made of wire about the thickness of sheep-fencing.--For more than a year past, <num value="2">two</num> wild eagles of the same species have frequented the mountain over his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>They have, on several occasions, alighted on the cage of the tame eagle, and also on the top of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>They are not in the least shy, and, as no <num value="1">one</num> is permitted to molest them, they seem quite at home. --Last week <num value="1">one</num> of them broke through into the cage of the tame eagle, where he remained for a few minutes, and got out again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> &#x0022;On <date>Friday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, he broke in again, when some of the workmen stopped his means of exit, which seemed to astonish him no little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He was a splendid bird, with a spread of wing apparently over <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure>. After keeping him half an hour, <persName n="Pike,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Pike,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pike</surname></persName> opened the cage door and let him out. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he did not fly, as he seemed out of breath with his exertions, but allowed himself to be driven for <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure>, to a rising ground, where he took wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Instead, however, of flying off at once, he remained poised over the cage, but at a great height, for <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. These eagles build in the cliffs of Dooega, <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> off, in the face of a precipice which is about <measure n="1000feet" type="distance">one thousand feet</measure> high and perpendicular. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> &#x0022;The tame eagle seems to be the attraction; the wild ones remain in sight of it about <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> each day. They chiefly prey upon hares, which are abundant in the locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Their mode of pursuing them is curious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>They almost always hunt in couples, and, when once the hare is started, <num value="1">one</num> poises itself in the air to mark the game, while the other twists and turns about, like a greyhound, within a few yards of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>If, by any chance, the pursuer loses sight of the prey, he at once poises, and the other takes up the running, and so on until they kill.&#x0022; </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> <back>
