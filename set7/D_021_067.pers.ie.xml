<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> The <hi rend="italics">Banner</hi> gives the same extracts; illustrating and exhibiting the can't and hypocrisy of the puritanical plunderers who now infest <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We omit the disgusting details, but cannot omit the following explanation of the way in which these <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> respect private property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> What, then, should be the true system of administration here? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> It has been proposed to lease the plantations and the people upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>To this plan there are <num value="2">two</num> objections, each conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>In the first place, the leading object of the parties bidding for leases would be to obtain immediate revenue &mdash; perhaps to make a fortune in a year or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The solicitations of doubtful men offering the highest price would impose on the leasing power a stern duty of refusal, to which it ought not unnecessarily to be subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Far better a system which shall not invite such men to harass the leasing power, or excite expectations of a speedy fortune to be derived from the labor of this people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Secondly. No man, not even the best of men, charged with the duties which ought to belong to the guardians of these people, should be put in a portion where there would be such a conflict between his humanity and his self-interest &mdash; his desire, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, to benefit the laborer, and on the other the too often stronger desire to reap a large revenue, perhaps to restore broken fortunes in a year or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Such a system is beset with many of the worst vices of the slave system, with the advantage in favor of the latter that it is for the interest of the planter to look to permanent results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> Let the history of <placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">British East India</placeName>, and of all communities where a superior race has attempted to build up speedy fortunes on the labor of an inferior race occupying another region be remembered, and no just man will listen to the proposition of leasing, fraught as it is with such dangerous consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Personal confidence forbids me to report the language of intense indignation which has been expressed against it here by some occupying high places of command, as also by others who have come here for the special purpose of promoting the welfare of these laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Perhaps it might yield to the treasury a larger immediate revenue, but it would be sure to spoil the country and its people in the end. The Government should be satisfied if the products of the territory may be made sufficient for a year or <num value="2">two</num> to pay the expanses of administration and superintendence, and the inauguration of a beneficent system which will settle a great social question, insure the sympathies of foreign nations now wielded against us, and advance the civilization of the age. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> The better course would be to appoint superintendents for each large plantation, and <num value="1">one</num> for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> smaller combined, compensated with a good salary, say <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> per year, selected with reference to peculiar qualifications, and as carefully as <num value="1">one</num> would choose a guardian for his children, clothed with a separate power to enforce a paternal discipline; to require a <unclear>proper</unclear> amount of labor; cleanliness, sobriety, and better habits of life, and generally to promote the moral and intellectual culture of the wards, with such other inducements, if there be any placed before the superintendent as shall inspire him to constant efforts to prepare them for useful and worthy citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>To quicken and arouse the fidelity of the superintendents, there should be a director general or governor, who shall visit the plantations, and see that they are discharging these duties; and, if necessary, he should be aided by others in the duty of visitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>This officer should be invested with liberal powers over all persons within his jurisdiction, so as to protect the blacks from each other and from white men, being required in most important cases to confer with the military authorities in punishing offences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>His proposed duties indicate that he should be a man of the best ability and character; better if he have already, by virtue of public services, a hold on the public confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Such an arrangement is submitted as preferable for the present to any cumbersome territorial government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> ***** </p> 
<p> What should be the standard of wages where none has heretofore been paid, is not so easy to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>It should be graduated with reference to the wants of the laborer and the ability of the employer or Government, and this ability being determined by the value of the products of the labor, and the most that should be expected being that, for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, the system should not be a burden on the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Taking into con- <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> sideration the cost of food and clothing, medical attendance and extras, supposing that the laborer would require rations of pork and beef, meal, coffee, sugar, molasses, and tobacco, and that he would work <measure n="300days" type="date">300 days</measure> in the year, he should receive about <measure n="40cents" type="currency">40 cents</measure> a day in order to enable him to lay up <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">$30</measure> a year, and each healthy woman could do about equally well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/><measure n="300days" type="date">Three hundred days</measure> in a year is perhaps too high an estimate of working days, when we consider the chances of sickness and days when by reasons of storms and other causes there would be no work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It is assumed that the laborer is not to pay rent for the small houses tenanted by him. This sum, when the average number of acres cultivated by a hand, and the average yield per acre, are considered with reference to market prices, or when the expense of each laborer to his <hi rend="italics">former master,</hi> the interest on his assumed value, and on the value of the land worked by him, these being the elements of what it has cost the master before making a profit are completed, the <rs>Government</rs> could afford to pay, leaving an ample margin to meet the cost of the necessary implements, as well as of superintendence and administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The figures on which this estimate is based are at the service of the <name>Department</name>, if desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>It must also be borne in mind that the plantations will in the end be carried on more scientifically and cheaper than before, the plow taking very much the place of the hoe, and other implements being introduced to facilitate industry and increase the productive portion of the soil. </p> </q><bibl n="The Athens"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> The <hi rend="italics">Banner</hi> adds: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> By examining the last paragraph, it will be seen that each able-bodied negro is to be allowed <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure> per day for <num value="300">three hundred</num> working days in the year; provided he loses no time from bad weather or sickness; if he does, the lost time is to be deducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>In another part of the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>it is stated that the rations are deducted from the wages.--<measure n="40cents" type="currency">Forty cents</measure> per day for <measure n="300days" type="date">three hundred days</measure> is <measure n="120dollars" type="currency">one hundred and twenty dollars</measure> per annum, provided no time is lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Again, if the negro has a wife and children who cannot make wages, their rations are also to be deducted from the <measure n="120dollars" type="currency">$120</measure>. So, according to the programme of this philanthropic and pious <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, the poor negro will sum up his year's earnings after the manner of the clown's sum-- &#x0022;nought from nought and nothing remains; a tail from a tadpole and frog remains.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> It seems, however, from the report, that many of the negroes are not to be caught by these pretended friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>They are intelligent enough to see that they will be worked harder by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> than their former masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> proposes to call them &#x0022;wards,&#x0022; but <persName><foreName>Sambo</foreName></persName> does not think that any better name than slave, if they fare worse; so, many declare most emphatically that they prefer going back to their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>But the agent thinks he will be able to get that out of their heads by a judicious course of discipline.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> The whole report is a fine specimen of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> puritanical can't and hypocrisy. </p> </q><bibl n="The Banner"></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Almost at the commencement of the war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>--in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, <num value="76">76</num>--the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> army, under the orders of <persName n="Putnam,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Putnam,nomatch:0"><surname>Putnam</surname></persName>, was attacked on <placeName key="tgn,7015824" n="1.000 2" reg="long island city, queens, new york">Long Island</placeName> by an over whelming force of <name>British</name> regulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> seemed to have interposed at the propitious moment to stay the hand of the victor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Instead of assaulting, he made his men camp on the ground; the opportunity was lost, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> carried the whole force over in the night, and the advantage could never be recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>But the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> lost <num value="3000">3,000</num> men killed, wounded, and prisoners, at a time when they had not <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> in the field in all parts of the country.
