<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> --<hi rend="smallcaps">Rose-colored Views of the <rs>War</rs>.</hi>--The most curious feature of the war at the <rs>North</rs>, is the fact that the ultra Abolitionists are the most lukewarm class engaged in its prosecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The war upon the slaveholding <rs>South</rs> is emphatically their thunder; but, by some strange want of tact or vigilance, they have allowed what we of the <rs>South</rs> used to regard as the <q>&#x0022;conservative classes of the <rs>North</rs>&#x0022;</q> to steal away that thunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The only grumbling that we hear in Congress comes from these turbulent and disgruntled spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The only attacks upon the policy of the <name>Administration</name> are of their making; and we find in their speeches what the masses of the people of that section really think of public affairs, though none but the <name>Hales</name>, Stevenses, and Greeleys, dare give utterance to the popular feeling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> In the <rs>Federal Senate</rs>, <persName n="Hale,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Hale,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, has the temerity to denounce the seizure and confinement of citizens and the overthrow of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus.</hi> <q>&#x0022;Our fathers fought for principle, for constitutional liberty, regulated by law, and not for mere independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The Government had better fail than be faithless to that great principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>It was that principle which brought this Government into being; and, sir, if the time ever arrives when this principle cannot exist, let the nation die. Let it perish, and its memory be blotted from among the nations of the earth, for it has failed in its high mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>It will be faithless to the principles which gave it birth, and wanting in all the elements of life and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Constitutional liberty regulated by law &mdash; that is the beginning and the end of this nation, its high mission, and if it does not vindicate that, then it had better never have been born, and the <rs>British</rs> arms had better have crushed the rebel forces when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrayed themselves against that power, than for them to have achieved an independence, and we to have lived for nearly a century simply to surrender up that great boon to any power on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Have any arrests been made in violation of the great principles of our Constitution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>If they have, let us know it.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Then we will be asked to raise <num value="413000000">four hundred and thirteen millions</num> of dollars for the next year, making necessary to be appropriated by this Congress more than <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> of dollars without the addition of a single dollar more than is estimated for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> <q>&#x0022;We have had a rose-colored view of the whole matter presented to us in the <rs>President</rs>'s message; we were informed that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> had assumed an attitude which she could sustain herself in alone; we were told that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> was all but tranquilized, and would never again be in danger from traitors, and now we are told that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> will not be satisfied without an exclusive military occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>If the force already there be not sufficient to guard and protect her, let her have as many more men from the main army as she calls for. In <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> name, in fair defence of the <rs>State</rs>, let gentlemen give as many men as may be necessary, not only to conquer her from the rebels, but to hold her. I believe that the secessionists would rise again to-morrow in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> if we withdrew our troops from there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>I do not believe in the semblance of loyalty there, or that even that semblance would continue a day in the absence of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>I do not know how <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> can have <num value="7">seven</num> regiments in our service, and none in that of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, I don't know how the <rs>President</rs> gets his facts, but I don't believe it myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>I believe the <rs>President</rs> is misled in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>I believe he is laboring under a fatal hallucination &mdash; unwillingly, no doubt &mdash; but as grievous as that under which <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName> labored with regard to the <name>Philistines</name>, when he was under the manipulation of Delilah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>He could not vote a dollar to call into the service any more troops than now are mustered, unless a necessity can be shown for their employment.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> It is in this manner that the leading abolitionists in either house of the <orgName n="Washington Congress" type="congress">Washington Congress</orgName> make bold to read wholesome lectures to the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>We have no doubt that the war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will give new courage and voice to a faction always troublesome, and probably soon to become formidable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> --It is asserted by all the historians of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution, that the cause of freedom never was in such peril, during the entire period of the struggle, as it was immediately after the alliance with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> had been concluded.--The people had previously been making gigantic exertions &mdash; had become fatigued with the constant labor imposed by the necessities of their situation &mdash; and were naturally desirous of repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>When they found themselves in alliance, therefore, with a great Power, they were too ready to believe that the hour of their deliverance had already struck &mdash; that having, single handed, withstood successfully the utmost efforts of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to subdue them, they had no longer anything to fear from her, when they had such a friend to stand by their side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>This spirit rising among the masses at home, soon extended to Congress, and produced its natural effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>A want of energy became almost instantly apparent in all the departments of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>As a citizen and a Senator I have the right of criticizing the acts of the <rs>Government</rs>; and I mean to exercise it with the full flush of a truthful patriotism &mdash; kindly but fearlessly, cordially but searchingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>I will waste no words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>I do not wish uselessly to consume your time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>But the hour is when truth should be spoken in these halls, and that plainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>I declare, then, as a fact which all financiers will admit and no statesman dispute, that every day's delay in the vigorous prosecution of this war is pregnant with peril to the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Sir, this is a war of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>When <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> fell they became a unit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Party prejudices were scattered, personal hates forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Roused by their wrongs, they proffered their strength and pledged all their resources to avenge an injustice which threatened to destroy the freest Government of earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> followed &mdash; a fearful reverse, and seemingly a fatal defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>But even that did not dash the spirit nor shake the purpose of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The balk of the moment, the blood and treasure lost, only deepened their determination to crush out the conspiracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Such unity, such ardor, such sacrifices, the world has rarely or never witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Sir, let me not be misunderstood in this matter of delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>My confidence in the <name>Administration</name> will not permit me for a moment seriously to entertain the injurious suspicion that this army we have created &mdash; so admirable in spirit and discipline, so complete in all its appointments &mdash; this magnificent organization, to which the country has contributed its choicest spirits, and on which it has lavished untold <num value="1000000">millions</num> of treasure &mdash; is destined, without <num value="1">one</num> decisive blow struck, to a living burial in the inglorious obscurity of winter quarter!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>But should this confidence prove to be misplaced &mdash; should this fatal policy of inaction seize upon the energies of our, rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>I feel, I know, that the public announcement of the fact will be as the fire-bell at <time value="12am">midnight</time>. Dismay and confusion will follow, and the evils of anarchy may interpose new and fearful obstacles to the restoration of that Government whose chief peril must always result from the loss of confidence on the part of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Fortunately, the people are as intelligent as they are patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>They do not require impossibilities, nor insist upon premature action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>And thus we are brought to the consideration of the questions of strength and preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Why is our army inactive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Will it be answered that it is still deficient in discipline?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>That reply would be as unjust as it is illogical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Ours is an army of volunteers, who must not be judged by the rules applied to regulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>You cannot drill it into that mere machine which martinets consider the perfection of efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The citizen soldier is an individual; no amount of discipline can destroy his individuality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/><measure n="4months" type="date">Four months</measure> of industrious drill is ample time to prepare such troops for effective service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Prolonged inactivity will finally discourage his zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The prospect of action must be ever present as an incentive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Inaction is the bane of the volunteer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>These opinions I express with confidence, for I have had a large personal experience in the management of volunteer soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The training of <num value="2">two</num> distinct regiments during the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war, with subsequent labors in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and the campaigns of the last <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs> in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, have given me a practical knowledge on this subject entitled to consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>The regiments that fought and won the <rs n="Battle of Buena Vista" type="battle">battle of Buena Vista</rs> were not as well provided as the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, and not better drilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Sir, I have witnessed the drill of that Army, and I am satisfied that it has reached the maximum of discipline attainable by volunteers, and that every day of inaction now tends to its demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>While, also, as regards discipline, we are as fully prepared for action as we ever shall be. We have the advantage of superiority in that respect to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> Every unprejudiced observer during the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war will testify that the regiments from the <rs>North</rs>, in the excellence of their drill, far exceeded those from the <name>States</name> now in rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Our opponents are formidable only when their individuality can be shown while fighting under cover &mdash; as at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014531">Springfield</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Ball's Bluff">Ball's Bluff</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Operating in mass, on the open field, we can always conquer &mdash; as at Dry <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Wood,nomatch:0"><surname>Wood</surname></persName>, where <num value="400">four hundred</num> <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> troops checked and drove back <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> rebels; and of these facts the <rs>Confederates</rs> themselves are fully aware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Recently, at <placeName reg="Spring River, Arkansas, Arkansas" key="tgn,2687656">Spring river</placeName>, <num value="800">eight hundred</num> <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> troops encountered <num value="6000">six thousand</num> rebels, covered by that stream and <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> of timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>This handful of heroic men offered a fight on the open prairie, which was declined by the enemy &mdash; either because they expected us to repeat the folly of attacking them in their timber stronghold, or feared a defeat without its protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>It will require on our part rapidity of movement and boldness of strategy to force them into a battle on the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>So much for inefficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>That heroic veteran, the late <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> of the army, now forced by age and infirmity into a retirement made glorious by the memories of a long life of patriotism and triumph, announced the fact that the ides of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> would see his column prepared to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Hence, it is impossible not to believe that they are by this time complete in arms, equipment, means of transportation, and every other physical appliance of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Why, then, do they tarry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>If <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, with <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> undisciplined recruits, scaling the frozen fastnesses of the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>, and avoiding their hostile fortifications, could, in <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure>, reach the plains of <placeName key="tgn,7003237" n="1.000 6" reg="lombardy">Lombardy</placeName>, pierce the <rs type="place">Austrian lines</rs>, and annihilate the <orgName>army of <persName n="Melas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Melas,nomatch:0"><surname>Melas</surname></persName></orgName>, a <num value="120000">hundred and twenty thousand</num> strong, on the field of <placeName reg="Marengo, Iowa, Iowa" key="tgn,2035190">Marengo</placeName>, thereby emancipating the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, shall it be said that we cannot surmount the hills of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, in spite of their defences, and, penetrating to the heart of the rebellion, strike in detail their armies &mdash; inferior to our own in numbers, arms, equipment, discipline and all that constitutes the true soldier, and stretched along a line of over <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">two thousand miles</measure> in extent &mdash; destroying the heterogeneous hosts as we go, or scattering them in consternation, and restore to the rule of the republic those fair regions now cursed by a usurpation more intolerable than that of the <name>Austrian</name>, and which holds in bonds of terror even those wretched men who are committed to its support?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, to doubt our ability is disgraceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Let it not be said that the snows of winter are upon us. If <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> could march his barefooted soldiers over the frozen roads of <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, their footsteps marked with blood, and in the middle of winter cross the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, filled with floating ice, can we not, at the same season, move our well clad legions towards the mild valleys of the <rs>South</rs>, to re-establish that freedom which their sufferings secured?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Will you wait till spring, when the roads, if ever, will become impassable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>or till our troops shall have been decimated by the diseases of summer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>No. Clear this war of the doubts that surround its purpose; give to the volunteer a battle cry; cherish that enthusiasm which is indispensable to success, and which nerved the conscripts of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> to the achievement of victory without reference to disparity of numbers, See that your volunteers are not thrown upon artillery without preparation; they must see the guns, count them, hear the whistle of their balls, and thus prepared, no strength of fortifications can resist them; they are the most effective troops on earth. ****** The occupation of the rebel States by our army is a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>I laugh to scorn the policy of wooing back the traitor to their allegiance by seizing and holding unimportant points in those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Every invitation extended to them in kindness is an encouragement to stronger resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The exhausting policy is a failure; so long as they have <num value="4000000">four million</num> slaves to feed them, so long will this rebellion be sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>My word for it, sir, long before they reach the point of exhaustion the people of this country will lose confidence in their rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>And it is unreasonable to expect the loyal citizens of the rebel States to manifest their desire to return to their allegiance while their homes and families are in the power of their oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Did the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs> welcome <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> till he had expelled their tyrants, and thereby proved his ability to protect them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>So with the people of the disloyal States; march your armies there; engage and scatter the forces of the enemy; whip somebody; evidence your ability to protect the loyal citizens, their homes and families, and then, and not till then, will they rally to your standard by <num value="1000">thousands</num> and tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>I have alluded, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, to the slave population of the rebel states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>It is claimed by the friends of slavery that the institution is a source of military strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>The slaves are made not only to feed and clothe their oppressors, but to build fortifications for their defence, and even in some cases to bear arms in their service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The slaveholders are right, and they are wrong; the institution is an element of strength, but only while it exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Withdraw that element, and this rebellion falls of its own weight.--The masters will not work, and they must eat. Now, they are fighting to retain their <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> slaves, exposing their lives and the lives of their sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Suppose we had their slaves; to what lengths would they not go in an opposite direction, in the hope to recover them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>They would bow down in dutiful submission, even to <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>In my opinion, the obtaining possession of those slaves by the <rs>Government</rs> would be more effective in crushing out the rebellion than the seizure, if it could be made, of every ounce of ammunition they possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>As the fear of losing their slaves is now the incentive to war, so would then the desire for their recovery be the inducement for peace.--<dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct> your armies into the heart of their Confederacy &mdash; win <num value="1">one</num> victory &mdash; oppose kindness to cruelty, and as the peasantry of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> rallied to the standard of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> on his return from <placeName key="tgn,7006197" n="1.000 46" reg="isola d' elba">Elba</placeName>, so will the slaves, with <num value="1">one</num> impulse, flock to ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>The General who commands that army will be received with the same acclaim as was <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>; they will hail him as their liberator and friend, and by their very numbers will secure safety to his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>No trouble, then, in obtaining information of the enemy's operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> The arrest of an English mail steamer by an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> vessel of war is so serious a fact that we may be justified in believing that the officer who committed the act did so upon his own responsibility, so that, if he was obeying instructions from the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the latter had not sufficiently weighed the consequences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/> In either case we hope that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> government will make a reparation and satisfy the claims of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>We count upon it doing so in its own interests, which have always served as a guide to its policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/> In fact, it is impossible that the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> should not understand how irregular is the arrest of <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> on board the <rs type="ship">Trent</rs>; how contrary it is to the law of nations, and how prejudicial the consequences of this act would be to themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/> It would be the consecration of the <q>&#x0022;right of search,&#x0022;</q> against which they have always protested, and which was <num value="1">one</num> of the chief causes of the war they themselves waged with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>--a right of search exercised not only on commercial vessels, but on ships-of war, for the mall steamers are royal vessels, having on board a lieutenant of the royal navy, and their officers wear the uniform of the <rs>British</rs> navy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/> By declaring contraband of war simple passengers, with or without a diplomatic mission, the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> strike a mortal blow against the privileges of neutral States which it is to their interest more than any <num value="1">one</num> else to see respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Neutrality has been up to the present time their invariable rule of conduct, and that egotistical though wise policy (because wisdom has become the synonym for egotism in the affairs of the world) has made of nearly all wars of other nations the occasion of fortune for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>If the flag does not cover passengers as it covers goods, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> marine, which is engaged principally as transports, loses its revenues with the loss of its inviolability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>It is, therefore, a sort of suicide which it commits in laying its hands on this privilege which it has violated under circumstances in no way excusable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>If they had arrested men going from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> and carrying succor of any kind to their opponents of the <rs>South</rs>, this might perhaps be understood, looking into the circumstances of time and place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>But <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00248" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> were leaving <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>, and it was in a neutral country that they took their passage upon a neutral vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>If they could be arrested there, they could as well be arrested in <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> or in <placeName key="tgn,7008927" n="1.000 4" reg="le havre,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Havre</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/> They were going to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, it is said, to plead the cause of the <rs>South</rs> at the tribunal of diplomacy; but that is not an act of direct aggression, and the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had the least right to give it that character when they themselves had caused the departure, almost at the same moment, on the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Arago</rs>, of <persName n="Weed,Mister,Thurlow,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="default:Weed,Thurlow,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thurlow</foreName> <surname>Weed</surname></persName>, charged, it is said, with a similar mission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/> In short &mdash; and this is not the least decisive consideration &mdash; the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> preserve enough of prudence at the bottom of their temerity, enough of wisdom, even in their passions, not to cast themselves voluntarily. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="page" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/> On board the <rs type="ship">Trent</rs>, the envoys of the <rs>South</rs> believed that they were under the protection of the <rs>English</rs> flag, as well as of the royal mail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Was this according to the precise orders of their Government, or was it by their personal inspiration?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Certainly, it was an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> vessel-of- war &mdash; the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs> &mdash; which pursued the <rs>Trent</rs>, stopped her, by force, seized the persons of <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName>, after having claimed them as contraband of war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The emissaries or agents of a Government have never been regarded as <q>&#x0022;contraband of war,&#x0022;</q> consequently, there has been a manifest violation of the <rs>English</rs> flag, and it is to be feared that it was ordered by the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> in its desire to seize at all risks, the dispatches of which the envoys of the <rs>South</rs> were the bearers.--Under any circumstances, the <rs>British Government</rs> cannot dispense with exacting as a reparation the dismissal of the officers of the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs>, the liberation of the passengers taken from the <rs>Trent</rs>, and an indemnity for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/> Regarded from the point of view of the right of nations, the act of the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs> is altogether unjustifiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>It is, in fact, admitted by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> themselves that in time of war the neutral flag covers the goods, even the goods belonging to belligerents, provided they be not contraband of war. Now, the <rs>Trent</rs> carried the <rs>English</rs> flag; it was notorious that she did not carry goods qualified as contraband of war; and coming from <placeName reg="Montour Falls, Schuyler, New York" key="tgn,2070618">Havana</placeName>, a neutral port, bound to <placeName key="tgn,7013107;tgn,7005136" n="0.284 000000.8512	placename;tgn,7013107;saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;0.054 000000.1612	placename;tgn,7005136;Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America" reg="saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America">St. Thomas</placeName>, another neutral port, she could not in plain justice have been the object of search on the part of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cruisers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/> On what ground, then, does the <rs>Commander</rs> of the san <rs>Jacinto</rs> &mdash;&mdash; who, until this act is disavowed, represents the federal Government &mdash; sustain his act of boarding the <rs>Trent</rs>, under the firing of cannon, and taken off some of her passengers by force?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>But as no international law interdicts a mail steamer from carrying passengers, be they or be they not called ambassadors, the subtle <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commander declares that he considered these ambassadors contraband of war, and as such he arrested them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Through the example and persuasion of her vicious mother she went far astray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>The small court was filthy in the extreme; seeming scarcely fit for the brood of pigs which occupied the ground so completely that it was difficult to pass them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/> <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> was lying on a cot bedstead, with only an old quilt to serve as a bed, while another was thrown over her.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/> At a subsequent visit we found her husband had returned from prison to see his fair young wife die.
