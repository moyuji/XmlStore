<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>We smile when we recollect that there was a time when we thought these skirmishes great battles, and the man who commanded the troops a great general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Those were the days of the pigmies in contrast with the gigantic race of the present day, and the gigantic achievements which they have already accomplished, and by which they are to be still more distinctly marked than they yet have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/><placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and its Lillipution combats, are fast fading from the memory of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> individual, however, that will never forget them.
