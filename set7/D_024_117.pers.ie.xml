<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Getting into position, he attacked with his corps about an hour before sunset, and driving the <hi rend="italics"><orgName type="corps" n="corps 11">Eleventh corps</orgName></hi> of the <rs>Federals</rs> before him, routed and pushed them nearly to <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Riding upward and down the lines, he scarcely closed his eyes throughout the night, and saw in person that all was ready. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <hi rend="italics">Examiner,</hi> of yesterday, states that the spoils of the battle-fields are immensely large &mdash; including <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> muskets and rifles, and a vast amount of coats, knapsacks, etc., abandoned by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>This is the best evidence of a stampeded and flying army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>None other escaping from the field of fight would have left so much behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Even Northern accounts show that the <orgName>army of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName></orgName>, or a very large part of it, ran &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">as only men do as when convinced that sure destruction is starting them.</hi>&#x0022; We quote their own words applied to the flight of the <name>Datchmen</name> commanded by that hero of bombast, <persName n="Shurz,,Carl,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Shurz,Carl,,,"><foreName>Carl</foreName> <surname>Shurz</surname></persName>, and have not a doubt that it may be applied with equal propriety to many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> birth, who are certainly not better or braver men than the <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The enemy was dreadfully defeated beyond a doubt, and with his demoralization and his rapidly disbanding regiments he cannot with any immediate movement menace our own <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, which stands now with no superior in history, ancient or modern. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The victories we have recently won are clearly among the grandest on record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The enemy was assailed by <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, on the <sic>memorable</sic> <date value="05-02">2d of May</date>, in a position (as the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs></hi> justly says,) stronger than that at <persName n="Gaines,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Gaines,John,,,"><surname>Gaines</surname></persName>'s Mill, and driven from it. The <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7017622" n="1.000 715" reg="wilderness, spotsylvania, virginia">Wilderness</placeName></hi> was a fastness which an army ought to hold against almost any colds; yet what do we see?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>A Confederate force drives out of that position an army of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at least <num value="3">three</num> times as numerous as itself!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Is not that a great victory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Is not that something to boast of?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Something to be rejoiced at?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Can an army immediately recover from such a defeat as our enemy received there? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Let us thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for this grand triple triumph!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>and let us, putting our trust cheerfully in <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> and our brave men, never, never despond, or for a moment doubt the result! --the ultimate triumph of the <rs>South</rs>, and the vindication of our Honor and our Right. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The new flag, which was displayed from the <rs>Capitol</rs> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, it is gratifying to say, gives universal satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Almost any sort of a flag, to take the place of the detested parody upon the &#x0022;<orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>,&#x0022; for so long the lawful ensign of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, would have been hailed with pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But the <num value="1">one</num> we now have is not only acceptable on this ground, but on account of its own appropriateness; and more than this, again, because in it is preserved that immortal banner &mdash; the battle flag &mdash; which has been consecrated on so many battle-fields, and has been followed by our soldiers to so many glorious victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We had not anticipated from the action of Congress upon the subject a result so sensible, so generally satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The councils of many on such a topic rarely produce anything but an abortion, such as the &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Stars and Bars!</hi>&#x0022; for instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Let us have no more of that, but hereafter know only that appropriate and beautiful banner hallowed by our victories and now established by law. </p> </div3>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> --About <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> morning a fire broke out in the <rs>Crenshaw Woollen Mill</rs>, of this city, resulting in <num value="1">one</num> of the most destructive and disastrous conflagrations which the city has ever been called upon to suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The fire originated, and was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered, in the picking room of the <rs>Crenshaw Woollen Mill</rs>, situated on the canal, and although it had made but little headway when discovered, such was the combustible nature of the material in the room that the flames spread with a rapidity that soon enveloped the whole building, and prevented anything from being rescued from the destructive element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The splendid machinery of the factory &mdash; the loss of which at the present time is irreparable &mdash; is involved in the ruin, besides a heavy stock of material used in the manufacture of cloths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>This material includes over <measure n="30000l." type="pounds"><num value="30000">30,000</num> pounds</measure> of wool, in the various stages of preparation for manufacturing purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>In addition to this there were in the building and destroyed, with everything else, some <num value="40">forty</num> pieces of finished goods, double width, amounting in all to about <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">1,000 yards</measure>, and some <num value="3000">3,000</num> to <measure n="4000yards" type="distance">4,000 yards</measure> of the same goods woven, but not completed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> This mill was the most extensive and valuable of its character in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and its loss will be seriously felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Since the commencement of the war it has been supplying large amounts of the most serviceable cloths for our soldiers, besides a finer article of goods for citizens wear and officers uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>At the time of its destruction it was making about <measure n="2000yards" type="distance">2,000 yards</measure> of double width goods per week, with a capacity to manufacture annually goods sufficient to cloths from <num value="40000">40,000</num> to <num value="50000">50,000</num> men. By this disaster about <num value="150">150</num> operatives are thrown out of employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The insurance on the building, machinery, stock, &#x0026;c., amounted to something over <measure n="170000dollars" type="currency">$170,000</measure>. It is impossible at present to form anything approximating an accurate estimate of the loss sustained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> From the woollen mill the fire rapidly spread to the valuable shops of the <orgName n="Tredegar Works" type="works">Tredegar works</orgName>, and before the flames could be arrested the machine shops, boring mills, pattern shops, blacksmith and carpenter shops of that extensive and valuable establishment were destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The extent of damage done to the machinery in these shops could not be ascertained yesterday, as much of the machinery was of an indestructible character, and may possibly not have received any serious injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The rolling mills and casting departments of the establishment were not injured, and it was the opinion of the superintendent of the works that in a few weeks operations might be resumed in the boring department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>There was a large number of heavy guns on hand, ready for service, which, we are glad to state, received little or no injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The loss in the pattern shops, it is presumed, will be rather heavy, owing to the difficulty in replacing patterns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>A large number of hands were yesterday at work clearing away the rubbish, and rescuing the machinery from the ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The loss to the proprietors of the works will be very heavy, and the delay in manufacturing guns will, to some extent, be felt by the <rs>Government</rs>; but, as stated, it is not thought that this delay will be protracted beyond a few weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The works were partially insured in the following offices viz: Mutual Assurance Society, <orgName n="Richmond Fire Association" type="association">Richmond Fire Association</orgName>, Virginia Fire and <orgName n="Marine Insurance Company" type="company">Marine insurance Company</orgName>, <orgName n="Old Dominion Insurance Company" type="company">Old Dominion Insurance Company</orgName>, Merchants' <orgName n="Insurance Company" type="company">Insurance Company</orgName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> <orgName n="Insurance Company" type="company">Insurance Company</orgName> of <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>. </p>
