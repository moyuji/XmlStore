<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The present remoteness of the scene of active operations has greatly enhanced the difficulties of obtaining anything approaching an accurate account of the movements of the <num value="2">two</num> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>So long as the immediate vicinity of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was the theatre of battle, we bad daily opportunities of acquiring information from which we are now cut off. The policy of the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; whether wise or injudicious we will not now attempt to discuss &mdash; has been to prohibit all persons unconnected with the army from visiting the lines; hence, at a distance of <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> the newspaper reporter finds himself as much embarrassed in obtaining correct intelligence as the anxious public for whom he catena. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Our latest published advices from the army were to noon on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, at which time an engagement seemed imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The position of the contending forces gave currency to the belief that an action would not be long delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>During <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, however, matters remained quiet, and the fight that was so confidently anticipated, as early as <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, did not occur. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Early on Sunday a portion of the forces of the enemy were evidently in motion, but what their movement indicated was more matter of conjecture &mdash; some supposing that they were endeavoring to continue their retreat from <placeName reg="Berkeley, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002254">Berkeley</placeName> further down the river, and others suggesting that they were trying to work round to the left of our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In either event, we feel confident that our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are prepared to anticipate them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Yesterday, throughout the day, we had in circulation an abundance of rumors, but it is needless that we should entertain the public by giving them further publicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Early in the day it was asserted, with apparent confidence, that a most desperate and determined fight was in progress, and that <num value="3">three</num> of our divisions were engaged in the struggle.--From the known position of the <num value="2">two</num> armies, and the positive expectation that a fight was inevitable, this rumor was readily received as reliable, and the street retailers of army intelligence found no difficulty in creating the belief that the bloody tragedies of last week were about to be re-enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>As might have been expected under the circumstances, the public anxiety was intense, but there was not so much as the slightest-manifestation of want of confidence in the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The prevailing opinion was that our forces had attacked the enemy, only to achieve another brilliant success, and to complete the dismay of the routed and discomfited enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We endeavored to trace this rumor to a source entitled to give it the sanction of authenticity, but were soon convinced that it originated more from confidence in the expectation of a collision than from any information that had reached the city from the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> There are statements to the effect that the enemy has been largely reinforced in his new position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>These may or may not be so, but we think, from the best information we have, that it is not at all improbable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is an unquestionable fact, that they have the men and the means of transportation; and it is equally undeniable that they have the determined disposition to put forward every exertion for the reduction of the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This feat, however, may now be regarded beyond the range of probable events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>An army like ours, flushed with successive victories, with the reinforcements that may be easily brought into the field, will present an insurmountable barrier to the <q>&#x0022;onward to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022;</q> march of the young <rs>Napoleon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Indeed, it is plausible to apprehend that the <rs>Northern</rs> army will find it no mean undertaking to save their own capital within <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It can scarcely be expected that our Government will permit such advantages as we have gained within the past few days, through the resistless valor and intrepidity of our troops, to pass unimproved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> To return to the present condition of affairs below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we can only state what we have heard, but from parties whom we believe to be entitled to the fullest credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Up to noon yesterday there had been no engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>A most vigilant watch was kept upon the movements of the enemy, and it was not thought that his position was such as to render an attempt at escape entirely successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He has either to offer a manly fight to the forces confronting him, or suffer severe loss in a further retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If he offers fight, he will meet with certain defeat; if he attempts to retreat, he will be closely pursued by an army that will disregard every inconvenience to make our triumph complete and the rout of the enemy effectual. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> It was reported yesterday that <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> cavalry and <num value="1">one</num> piece of artillery, had forced his way into the enemy's rear, on his right, and opened fire upon a Federal transport, with good effect, putting a number of shot through her. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The movements of the enemy about <persName n="Berkeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Berkeley,nomatch:0"><surname>Berkeley</surname></persName> continue to attract much attention from spectators on this side, who cannot but regard them with interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They are busily employed down there about something, and the congregation of so many wagons, and so many vessels at that point is significant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The wagons, the tents, the steamers, the sailing craft, the tugs, the arks, etc., were all there <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and there was much commotion among the water craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The width of the river at <placeName reg="Berkeley, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002254">Berkeley</placeName> is too great to enable observers on this side to distinguish with accuracy what the enemy really are about, but still much can be seen that the enemy would no doubt like to conceal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We are indebted to a gentleman, whose position for observation is a good <num value="1">one</num>, for the following note: </p> 
<div5 type="letter" n="1">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Large quantities of canteens, letters, writing paper, lemons, boxes, etc., have washed ashore here, and are found daily along the south shores of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>These are supposed to have been thrown away at <persName n="Shirley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Shirley,nomatch:0"><surname>Shirley</surname></persName> by the panic-stricken <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> From the present aspect of affairs on the river, it is my opinion that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has been reinforced by at least <num value="15000">15,000</num> men. The wagons and tents at and about <placeName reg="Berkeley, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002254">Berkeley</placeName> cover the fields as far as the eye can reach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> There is no warlike firing to-day, nor was there any yesterday, save a few shells, or rather signal guns, I suppose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Some <num value="50">fifty</num> guns were fired to day at <placeName reg="Westover, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2114993">Westover</placeName>, as a <date value="07-04">Fourth of July</date> salute, and the vessels all displayed the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The drifting of canteens, letters, writing paper, lemons, boxes, etc., from the north side of the river, indicates thane panic must have occurred recently among <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Shirley, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2660001">Shirley</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In no other way can we account for this apparently reckless squandering of army valuables.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> <hi rend="italics">Assuming, therefore, the acquisition of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,</hi> it becomes a question of the profoundest interest to foregather, as far as practicable, the subsequent course of the war. We may have a decided policy marked out; but the movements of a victorious army are vexatiously dependent upon those of the vanquished, and until we know definitely the plans of the insurgent leaders, it is in vain we fabricate the most elaborate strategical projects, and determine upon the most complex and apparently indefeasible combinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The shrewdest player at chess is often baffled by the very folly and inconsequence of his adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The rebels, however, are not wholly destitute of method in their lunacy; and if we may confide in a revelation made through a Nassau paper, and since very generally circulated in the <rs>South</rs>, they have a very clear and well defined plan for maintaining the war at least through the months of summer and early fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> taken, they propose a retirement to the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Scattered while the hot weather prevails among <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghenies</placeName> and the elevated grounds in the neighborhood, they propose to recruit and remodel their army for a winter campaign, leaving the <rs>Union</rs> forces to perish along the unwholesome seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>With the aid of innumerable guerrilla parties, they expect to keep enough of the open country clear of the enemy to leave them abundant supplies, and not wholly without means of communication with the coast, where, from time to time, the <name n="United Kingdom">British</name> vessels, bearing arms and munitions, will land those always necessary stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The Union forces, it is calculated, may object to this arbitrary partition of the <rs>Southern</rs> territory, and <hi rend="italics">will insist upon fighting their way into the hills, </hi> and exposing themselves to the ruinous odds of a contest with a foe entrenched in every advantage of position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>In this ill-advised warfare, the gain will be steadily in favor of the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They will destroy, discourage, and demoralize their antagonists, at the same time they secure the prestige of success to themselves, without exposure or loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>And if when winter arrives the <rs>National Government</rs> is not weary of a contest so ruinous the rebels will be in a capital condition to resume an offensive policy in the lowlands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> While such is, in all likelihood, the matured programme of the rebel managers, we are not aware that any counter-policy has been fixed upon by our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>What that policy should be can hardly be a topic of question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The idea of prosecuting an active campaign in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States during the heats of midsummer is, of course, impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The climate and disease would mow down our ranks with far more terrible certainty than would the guns of an enemy; while, used to climate and country, the rebels would not only evade disease, but make such admirable improvement of their topographical knowledge as to defy the pursuit of a perishing and disheartened soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>All the odds of such a contest would be adverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/><hi rend="italics">The nation, watching the profitless and fatal mistake of our rulers, would grow weary of the war, and respond to the calculations of the rebels by clamoring for peace.</hi> The alternative of this mistaken course is obviously a pause in active field operations during the summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Let the enemy be surrounded by an impenetrable cordon by land as well as by sea. Perfect the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Strengthen every position thus far gained on land, so as to hold it securely.--Sever all railroad connections within reach, so that reinforcements and supplies can only reach the enemy with the almost difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Draw in as narrowly as possible the circuit of the <rs>Union</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Let vigilance while the summer lasts, take the place of energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/><hi rend="italics">When the rebel Capital shall be ours, delay will be the ally of the <rs>North</rs>.</hi> Every hour the rebels suffer under the opprobrium of that loss, will weaken and disorganize them; while the moral gain to the <rs>Union</rs> cause can only be endangered by persistence in active warfare sure to be attended with disaster and constant failure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> Whatever may be the plans of the rebels, the path of our duty is plainly set forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It is to place the army for the summer in a posture of vigilant repose, at once refreshing its strength and refilling its ranks, while the enemy is left to the decomposition sure to result from his compulsory inaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>When autumn comes, a result of this wise policy will be that there will, in all human probability, be no enemy to contend against. </p> </div4>
