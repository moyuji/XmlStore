<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The total liabilities of the company are <measure n="946552dollars" type="currency">$946,552</measure>. The company has <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> locomotives, which can all be used or so repaired as to be useful, and <num value="204">204</num> cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The bridge across the <name>Cow</name> pasture river, burnt by the enemy, will be rebuilt and ready for the trains early next year, so there will be a thorough line of travel to <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s river, as that across <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,Nathaniel,F.,,:1"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, which was washed away by a flood in that stream, has been already replaced. </p> </q><bibl n="road committee"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> That part of the road lying west of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> is in fine condition for the running of the trains, although very little labor has been spent on it during the past year, the obvious reason for which is that it was <hi rend="italics">ballasted</hi> soon after the track was laid, which kept the road-bed dry and prevented the cross-ties from being depressed by the weight of the trains. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> On the east side of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, in nearly all the cuts which are wet, the track is rough and uneven, and the iron is very much worn from the sinking of the cross-ties into the soft road bed, because most of them are without ballast, and the small force which the road master could obtain is entirely inadequate to keep the ditches open, put in cross-ties, and level up the track. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> <num value="100000">One hundred thousand</num> cross-ties will be needed for the road during the winter and the next summer, and unless a very large additional force can be put on it, if the winter should prove wet, it will be impossible to keep it in a condition to meet the demands of public travel, and also to transport supplies for the army and freight for private citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The timbers placed under the <rs type="place">Rivanna bridge</rs> as guards against the breaking down of the iron, of which the bridge is built, are decayed, and must be replaced at an early day; or, what would be better, build a bridge of timber, and use the iron of the old bridge for other purposes, as it is much needed in the shops. </p> </div3>

<head>The substitute question.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> The substitute question will doubtless be raised at an early day in the <rs>Congress</rs> which assembles early next month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The Governor of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> in his message to the <name>Legislature</name> devotes a considerable space to the consideration of this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We make some extracts from his views: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> That portion of the conscript act which authorizes those within conscript age to employ substitutes has, in my opinion, been productive of the most unfortunate results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>If conscription is right, or if it is to be acquiesced in as a matter of necessity, it is certainly just that it act upon all alike, whether rich or poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>With the substitution principle in the act, its effect has been to compel the poorer class, who have no money with which to employ substitutes, to enter the army, no matter what may be the condition of their families at home, while the rich, who have money with which to employ substitutes, have often escaped compulsory service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This is not just as between man and man. While I trust I have shown that the poorest man in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has such interest at stake as should stimulate him to endure any amount of hardship or danger for the success of our cause, it cannot be denied that the wealthy are under as great obligation to do service, as they have, in addition to the rights and liberties of themselves and their children, a large amount of property to protect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>If every wealthy man would do his duty and share his part of the dangers of the war, but few complaints would be heard from the poor.--But if the money of the rich is to continue to secure them from the hardships, privations and dangers to which the poor are exposed, discontent, and more or less demoralization in the army, must be the inevitable result. </p> </q><bibl n="The Legistature devotes"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> He who has paid <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">three thousand dollars</measure> for his substitute has often made it back in a single month by speculation, and it has not unfrequently happened that the families of those in service at <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> per month have been the most unfortunate victims of his splenization and extortion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> A very large number of stunt, able-bodied young men between <num value="18">18</num> and <measure n="45years" type="date">45 years</measure> of age, ace now out of the army, and in their places the <rs>Government</rs> has accepted old men over <num value="45">45</num>, who have, in most cases, been unable to undergo long marches, privation, and fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of these have sunk by the way, either into the hospitals or into the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It is also understood that much the larger number of deserters and stragglers from the army have been substitutes, who have entered it for hire, and after receiving the stipulated price have sought the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity to escape, which they have in some instances been permitted to do with the acquiescence and encouragement of officers, who have been their partners in guilty speculation.--Thus the same individual has been accepted as a substitute for each of several able-bodied young men, who have been left at home to seek for gain and enjoy comfort, while our enemies have gained advantages on account of the weakness of our armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> If we expect to be successful in our struggle the law must be so changed as to place is service the tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of young men who are now at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>This would reinforce our armies so as to enable us to drive back the enemy upon every part of our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>After this change in the law the <rs>Government</rs> could provide for the protection of the most important interests at home, by making proper details of such persons as are indispensably necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>This would be much better than the extension of the conscription act up to <num value="50">50</num> or <num value="55">55</num>, as it would bring into the field young men able to endure service, in place of old men who must soon fail when exposed to great fatigue and hard ship, many of whom are as competent as young men to overseer plantations and attend to other home interests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> But it may be dented that the <rs>Government</rs> can now so change the law as to make those who have furnished substitutes liable to service, as it is bound by its contract to exempt them, and they have acquired vested rights under the contract which it is not in the power of the <rs>Government</rs> to divest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Let us examine this for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Purchase a lot of land from the <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">State of Georgia</placeName>, and pay her <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> for it, and she conveys it to me by grant under her great seal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The contract is as solemn and binding as the <rs>Government</rs> can make it. My fee simple title is vested and complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>But while I have the grant in my pocket and the <rs>State</rs> has my money in her treasury, it is discovered that public necessity requires the <rs>State</rs> to repossess herself of the land; I refuse to sell to her; she may pay me just compensation and take the land without my consent, and she violates no fundamental principle, as all our private rights must yield to the public good, and if we are injured we can only require just compensation for the injury. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Again, suppose I have labored hard and made upon my land a surplus of provisions which are my own right and property, and I refuse to sell them to the <rs>Government</rs>, when the army is in need of them; it may take them without my consent and pay me just compensation, and I have been deprived of none of my constitutional rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> The right of a person who has employed a substitute to be exempt from military service can certainly stand upon no higher ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The Government has extended to such persons the privilege of exemption upon the employment of a proper substitute, but if the public safety requires it the <rs>Government</rs> certainly has as much right to revoke this privilege as it has to take from me my land, or my provisions, or other property, for public use; and all the person who employed the substitute could demand would be just compensation for the injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The measure of damage might be the amount paid by the principal for his substitute, less a just prorate for the time the substitute has served, and upon the payment of the damage or the just compensation for it, the <rs>Government</rs> would have the right to retain the substitute as well as the principal in service, as the substitute has been paid by the principal for the service, and the principal has been compensated for the damage done by him by ordering him into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It would be competent, however, in estimating the damages in such case, to take into the account the interest the principal has in the success of our cause and the establishment of our independence, as necessary to the perpetuity of his liberties and the security of all his rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It would also be competent to inquire whether he has indeed suffered any pecuniary loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>If he has paid <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">three thousand dollars</measure> for a substitute, and has been kept out of the army for that sum for <num value="1">one</num> year, and during that time he has made <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">ten thousand dollars</measure> more, by speculation or otherwise, than he would have made had he been in the army, at <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> per month, the actual amount of compensation due from the <rs>Government</rs> to him might be very small indeed, if anything. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> Believing that the public necessity requires it, and entertaining no doubt that Congress possesses the power to remedy the evil, without violating vested rights, I respectfully recommend the passage of a joint resolution by this <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> requesting Congress to repeal that part of the conscript act which authorizes the employment of substitutes; and, as conscription is the present policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, to require all persons able to do military duty, who have substitutes in service, to enter the military service of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> with the least possible delay, and to provide some just rule of compensation to those who may be injured by the enactment of such a law. I also recommend that said resolution instruct our <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, and request our representatives in Congress, to vote for and urge the passage of this measure at the earliest possible day. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> The advance of the enemy recently into the county of <placeName key="tgn,2002264" n="1.000 25" reg="greenbrier, west virginia, united states">Greenbrier</placeName> and adjoining country has been, no doubt, disastrous to the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The event occurred just at the nick of time, when the grain crops were matured and mostly gathered, and when cattle and hogs were fatted for killing and packing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The acquisitive <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, it may be well imagined, enjoyed the opportunity for stealing and feasting to the full extent of their power to take off and to eat. It is much to be regretted, in the present pinched condition of the country for supplies, that such an inroad upon them as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have made in the <rs>West</rs> should have taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It will be seriously felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>A goodly number of cattle fell into the enemy's hands because of the rigid interdiction of their exportation by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs> of the department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They could not be driven out, and the invaders arrived so suddenly that the owners had not time to avail themselves of the license to run them off which his coming certainly gave them, and their property was gathered in wherever it could be found by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124364">Greenbrier</placeName> is in the new <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">State of West Virginia</placeName>, formed by the lawless Northern Government in defiance of their own Constitution and without the consent of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>They are making an effort, as far as possible, to retain possession of the territory and to keep our forces out of it. The issue should be met, and their line of possession should be interrupted as much as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The gallant but limited advanced guard of our <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Western army</orgName> will no doubt do this to the extent of their power; and they have proved that they are worthy of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and of association with their brethren who have won such a glorious name on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>They will yet return to their front posts and allow the enemy anything but a quiet possession. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>He is of opinion that the <rs>North</rs> is much nearer exhaustion than the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Their bluster and bravado will increase in proportion as their strength diminishes, but if we are true to ourselves, patient, persistent and harmonious, the worst of our danger, with the blessing of Heaven, will soon be over.--Such at least is the opinion of <num value="1">one</num> whose name, if we could give it, would carry with it no ordinary weight. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Wherein they differ practically we are at loss to perceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The <num value="1">one</num> is an unmitigated brute in his manners as well as sentiments; the other, when he says in civilized language &#x0022;the rebellion must and shall be put down at whatever cost,&#x0022; means the same thing.
