<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> &#x0022;We need not inquire for great common offences which have exposed us to this terrible expression of the <name>Divine</name> displeasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>National guilt is formed by individual sins, and to the mass of iniquity so accumulated we have each fearfully contributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The wonder is, not that He has scourged, but that He has not cut short the work in righteousness and consigned us to remediless ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>But <name n="God" type="God">God</name> assures us that He doth not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men. It is that they may examine and try their ways and turn unto the <rs>Lord</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> &#x0022;Now, as the national guilt, which displeases <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and calls for affliction, is formed by individual sins, so the penitence which must precede its removal is not an affair of State, to be conducted in our stead by those in authority, but the personal penitence of the people who constitute the nation, each individually transacting with <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Even the penitential services of the <rs type="place">House</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> are but the joint utterance and open avowal of individual contrition, neither beginning nor ending there, but brought from the solitude of the closet which has been broken by its moan, and deepened by the social and sympathetic confessions in the sanctuary, and abiding in the humble heart, not only as a guard against relapse, but as an incentive to all dutifulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>And this, dear brethren, is the very exercise essential to the health and salvation of the soul, to which, with appropriate helps, the church calls us, at this season, with special solemnity and earnestness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Borrowing the awakening language of inspiration, she addresses us: &#x0027;Therefore also now, saith the <rs>Lord</rs>, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning, and rend your hearts and not your garments; for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth Him of the evil.&#x0027; &#x0027;He spares us when we deserve punishment, and in His wrath thinketh upon mercy.&#x0027; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>He at once created a large sensation by exposing the back of his hand to the audience, with blood flowing from it. The excitement at this point was <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> extreme, and although it was hardly explicable how a rope could produce a wound from which the blood would thus copiously flow, the tables for the moment seemed to be turned upon the gentlemen whose brutality had been so strongly animated upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>That blood was caused by <persName n="Ferguson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName> in cutting the rope.&#x0027;</q>--Upon this, an immense shout of mingled triumph and indignation arose from the audience, whose sympathies, it was at once evident, had scarcely wavered, even during the sensation incident they had just witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>In the noise which ensued, <persName n="Ferguson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName>'s explanation was to us inaudible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> &#x0022;The audience now began to take matters into their own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/><num value="1">One</num> gentleman led the way, and several others scrambled over the footlights on the platform, with the view, apparently, of demanding their money of <persName n="Ferguson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It is due to <persName n="Hulley,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Hulley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Hulley</surname></persName> and <persName n="Cummins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Cummins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Cummins</surname></persName> to say that they did their utmost to keep the crowd back, and to protect <persName n="Furguson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="mostcommon:Furguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Furguson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Leighton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Leighton,nomatch:0"><surname>Leighton</surname></persName>, who were still on the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The numbers, however, were too great for resistance to avail; and the next thing witnessed was the overthrow of the cabinet, <persName n="Ferguson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName> being pushed backwards into it. He immediately rose, but as immediately retreated, and we are informed that he, the <name>Davenports</name> and <persName n="Fay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Fay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fay</surname></persName> were out of the building almost as soon as <persName n="Ferguson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName> was off the stage.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> &#x0022;The crowd on the platform at once proceeded to demolish the cabinet, and <persName n="Ferguson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Ferguson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ferguson</surname></persName>'s much-ridiculed &#x0027;structure&#x0027; will never again battle the scrutiny or beguile the credulity of a British audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The scene during the smashing and distribution of the fragments of the cabinet was very exciting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Pieces were thrown up into the galleries, and the occupants of that part of the hall busily vied with those in the body in scrambling for the spoils, while many resorted, probably as a relief to their excitement, to the exhilarating occupation of letting themselves down from the galleries on to the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/><num value="1">One</num> person only fell into the hands of the police upon a charge of breaking <num value="1">one</num> of the caryatides by which the gallery is supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>A portion of the right arm of the figure was knocked off by the young man placing his hand upon it as he dropped from the gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The proceedings, though turbulent, were exceedingly good-humored, and they were enlivened by a few burlesque addresses, delivered from the platform to those in the body of the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>In the meantime, some <num value="30">thirty</num> policemen had arrived; they occupied the stage, and the hall was shortly afterwards cleared.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Post"></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>On the occasion corresponding to this <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease.
