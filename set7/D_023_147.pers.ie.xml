<head>From <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The news from the armies in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> for the past <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> has been exceedingly meagre, and even rumors with reference to the respective forces have been unusually scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>By the train last night we were unable to obtain anything which looked to the probability of another attempt on the part of the enemy to recross the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Everything was reported quiet up to noon yesterday, with no new development of the operations of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> In the early part of the day yesterday it was asserted positively that a dispatch had been received from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> that the enemy were crossing the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName>, but on inquiry late last evening we were assured that no such dispatch had been received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The general impression is that their army has been withdrawn to the <rs>Potomac</rs> &mdash; whether to take transports for some other locality to pursue their inward to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> journey, or to go into winter quarters around the <rs>Federal</rs> capital, can only be conjectured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><num value="1">One</num> thing is certain, <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> is in no haste to renew the experiment which resulted so disastrously to his fortunes at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The report that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army has again changed commanders since the recent severe battle so <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> is renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This time it reaches as by way of <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, and is said to have as its origin that a notice of the fact appeared in a Northern paper received in the lower part of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The report now has it that <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> is assigned to the command of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The force that visited the <rs type="place">Court House</rs> was under the command of <persName n="Naglee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Naglee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Naglee</surname></persName>, and consisted of a whole brigade, including infantry, artillery and cavalry.--Their general appearance was that of the better class of troops, but their conduct proved that the heart of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cannot be estimated by his exterior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They supplied themselves very freely with liquor at several places in the county, got uproariously drunk and discharged their firearms at harmless barn yard fowls, doubtless under the impression that they were tainted with rebel sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But perhaps the greatest destruction of property at any <num value="1">one</num> point was at a locality known as <q> &#x0022;The <rs>Dragon</rs>.&#x0022;</q> near the line of <placeName reg="Middlesex, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002667">Middlesex county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There was an extensive tannery at that place, owned by <persName n="Reed,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Reed,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <surname>Reed</surname></persName>, which supplied the people of the surrounding country with leather, and it so happened that the amount on hand at the time of the visit was very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> loaded a wagon with the valuable material and took <num value="2">two</num> of <orgName n="horse"><persName n="Reed,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Reed,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Reed</surname></persName>'s horse</orgName>s to draw it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They then piled up all that remained, with the tanbark which was found in abundance, and net it on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At the usual exportion prices of leather, it is said, the quantity destroyed would amount to over <measure n="30000dollars" type="currency">$30,000</measure> worth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The party of the enemy that visited <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> in <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Queen county">Queen county</placeName>, numbered not more than <num value="18">eighteen</num> and might all have been captured by <persName n="Littleton,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Littleton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Littleton</surname></persName>'s men, had they not taken them <unclear></unclear> off in consequence of alarming reports of numerical strength brought in by pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We hear that some friendly rifle sent a bullet through the leg of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> picket near <address><street n="Wood's Cross Roads">Wood's Cross Roads</street></address>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is safe enough to presume that he did not compromise his well known Southern sentiments. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The men in open ranks stood with arms presented, the officers saluting, and the regimental bands playing, each band taking it up in succession, as the cortege passed.
