<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This has occasioned numerous complaints, and we very much regret our inability to obviate the difficulties out of which they have grown. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Some of our regular subscribers are under the impression that they are neglected to accommodate the transient demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They are mistaken in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There is no arrangement in the office intended to give any such preference over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>On the contrary, all of the regulations in the department which governs the distribution of the paper are intended for their advantage over all, after the malls are sent off. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If human energy can achieve this, it shall be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> The real state of the case was this: Upon bearing that the enemy had advanced as far as <placeName reg="Edwards' Ferry">Edwards' Ferry</placeName>, on the <rs>Maryland</rs> side of the river, <persName n="Hunter,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, stationed at <placeName><placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, <distance reg="4miles">4 miles distant</distance></placeName>, ordered <num value="1">one</num> <orgName n="Infantry Company" type="company">company of Infantry</orgName> thither, to take their position on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side, to act as a guard and to harass the enemy as much as possible in case of an attempt to cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>In fact, I cannot say with certainty that there was a whole company sent, at any rate not more at that time.--So that there was no regiment visible, and consequently no intention to march upon <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Their fire was directed to an officer and several citizens, I think, who were crossing Goose <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, which runs into the <rs>Potomac</rs> at this point, neither of whom was struck, nor was any <num value="1">one</num> of the company there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The ruse had the desired effect, showing that they could be easily scared, and was laughable in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>It is to save this <q>&#x0022;loss without gain&#x0022;</q> that they prefer to do now that which must be done eventually, viz: Settle this business by negotiation, as all belligerents have done before us.--It is true, we have but little hope of a peaceable settlement, which must be either on the basis of the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>, or of separation, and the reason is, because <num value="1">one</num> section is as obstinately determined to have a Union of the whole <num value="34">thirty-four</num> States as the other is to have a separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>If the testing of this question by physical force is considered so important as to justify all the loss and disaster entailed thereby, there is of course no use in argument.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/> Some week or <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago a young man, originally from the country, became engaged to marry a lady equal to him in rank and fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>She was a Parisian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>He occupies a lucrative place in <num value="1">one</num> of our railway company's offices here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Her father lives on the family estate, which is situated in <num value="1">one</num> of the mountain gorges near the <name>Francorepanish</name> frontier, and separated almost entirely from the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>He had passed for a widower about <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>. The young man paid a visit, to the old family seat, where indeed he was accustomed to spend his summer vacations, to collect the innumerable documents the <rs>French</rs> law requires the officer who performs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The marriage to have in his hands before he stamps the civil contract made before him with its Medean and Peralan character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/> He asked his father for his mother a burial certificate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>The father was extremely embarrassed by this appeal; but no bands could be published until the burial certificate had been lodged at the <rs>Mayor</rs>'s office, where the marriage was to be contracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>The father at last broke the silence, saying: <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/> &#x0022;My dear boy, I have for a great many years concealed a secret from you, because its possession would prove a painful burthen to you, because the honor of our house is interested in its maintenance, and your tender years have hitherto rendered you incapable of preserving it. Your mother lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>She is a lunatic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Come with me and I'll let you see her.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The father"></bibl></cit> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/> He carried his son, who was trembling with emotion, into an old tower which formed part of the architecture of the chateau, and they went to the top of it. The chamber on the last floor was the lunatic a cell &mdash; He opened the door, the son entered, and kneeling at the poor woman's feet, sobbed;<q>&#x0022;Mother ! mother !&#x0022;</q> in a most heart-rending manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>These touching appeals, which would have moved stone idols almost, made no impression on the poor lunatic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Her stare continued as vacant and her lips as speechless as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>The son, his soul sick at the sad spectacle, there gently upbraided his father for denying him the melancholy solace of sharing the attention he (the father) had bestowed on his wreck for so many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>The father repeated the excuse he had given of his son's youth and the importance of the secret to the family happiness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/> It became necessary to avow this misfortune to the bride's family, and they naturally desired to see for themselves, as the story that the wife was dead and the story that she was crazy, seemed something awkward, which needed explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Several members of the family went down to the distant chateau, and the poor lunatic was introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>As soon as she saw herself surrounded by witness, she said in a calm tone: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/> &#x0022;I am not mad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>I preferred languishing in prison all my life to being hourly harassed by these dreadful scenes of jealousy.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n=""></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> You may imagine the effect of this declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>The persons assembled thought at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> this accusation was but an additional evidence of the distracted state of her mind, for madness often borrow reason's mask, and wears it so well as to deceive even the most practical physicians of the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>The Faculty was appealed to. Before they could decide, her husband, who had been in a state of agitation ever since his wife charged him with her sequestration, became raving mad. His papers were inspected, and it appeared that he had been crazy &mdash; a monomaniac &mdash; his purenzy arising from jealousy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>He was carried to a mad-house, and his wife signed the marriage contract of her son.--<hi rend="italics">Paris Correspondence <orgName n="New Orleans Picayune" type="newspaper">N. O. Picayune</orgName>.</hi> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> Going into a very public ordinary for his dinner, he was surprised to observe the extra care with which a gentleman who took the seat opposite to him took off his hat; he turned his hat as nearly upside down as possible without breaking his neck; then placing his hand over the inside of his hat, he again turned it, and received its carefully guarded contents, concealed by a pocket handkerchief, in his hand; then gently laying the back of his hand on the cushion, he slid the hat and its contents off and commenced dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>The attention of my friend was irresistibly directed towards the hat; and his surprise greatly increased, the reader may well imagine, on observing the head of a sizable <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs> thrust out and looking sharply about him. The gentleman perceiving the discovery, addressed him: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/> <q>&#x0022;My dear sir, I was in hopes to have dined alone and not to annoy any <num value="1">one</num> with my poor pet. Allow me to explain: He is perfectly harmless &mdash; only a common black <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>I was advised to carry him on my head for a rheumatism; I have done so for a few weeks, and I am cured &mdash; positively cured of a most agonizing malady.
