<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They are, in fact, a series of political and moral maxims, fraught with wisdom derived from the profound study of man in all his relations, social and political; and are therefore as well adapted to the exigencies of nations which may arise of <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> hence as they were to those of the <rs>English</rs> people in his own day. There is nothing transitory about them; nothing lifted only to the particular occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>They are all full of vitality, and are of that description which mankind will not willingly let die. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> It is well known how violently opposed that great genius was to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <name>French</name> revolution; how clearly he traced its origin to its causes; how bitterly he denounced its atrocities; and how distinctly he foretold the end, which was then far distant, and not to come until he had been laid in his grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>While the <rs>Republic</rs> was proceeding with tremendous strides, overturning thrones and striking down nations, and while the <rs>English</rs> nation, tired of the conflict and of the little success which it had brought to the <rs>British</rs> arms, were eagerly crying out for peace, <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="nearbymention:Burke,Edmund,,,"><surname>Burke</surname></persName> was preparing his celebrated &#x0022;Letters upon a Regicide Peace,&#x0022; in which he endeavored to show that there could be no peace with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> but at the cost of national independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In those remarkable productions remarkable from the prophetic vein which runs throughout them he takes the position that no nation can be fatally defeated but by its own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The loss of battles, and even of cities and provinces, he tells us, are but slight wounds, while the loss of national spirit is the true blow at the vitus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>As long as the public spirit exists in vigor, disaster serves but to arouse the nation to a true sense of its own resources, and to call out energies of the existence of which it had never before dreamed. --&#x0022;While our heart is whole,&#x0022; says he, &#x0022;it will find means of make them.
