<head>The last Felly of Federalism.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The last folly of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> is, like its other follies, doing the cause of the <rs>South</rs> great service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The proclamation freeing the slaves changes in no wise the fate of the people in those districts of the seceded States overrun by the enemy, while it involes in their misfortunes all the people of the border slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Wherever the <rs>Northern</rs> hordes have spread themselves over the <rs>South</rs> they have taken away all the negroes they could by persuasion, and generally force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Therefore, the proclamation makes matters no worse, in respect to that kind of property, for the States-rights men of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> But the proclamation is absurd in another view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> has passed laws confiscating the entire property, personal and real, of all rebels, and they of course sweep everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The Southern patriot knows that if the <rs>Southern</rs> army fails to protect him the <rs>Northern</rs> robbers will despoil him of everything he possesses, and may not spare his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It matters not with him, therefore, that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> by proclamation declares his slaves free. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Since, then, it accomplishes nothing more than the policy already legalized by the <orgName n="Northern Congress" type="congress">Northern Congress</orgName>, there could be nothing gained by issuing this proclamation but some popularity with the insane fanatics of abolitionism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>To propitiate them and relieve himself from the pressure of their continued appeals, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> must have taken the step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But it will raise up enemies against him in the border States that will plague his imagination, and rob him of many a night's rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We have only to read <persName n="Nelson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Nelson</surname></persName>'s eloquent address to the people of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, to be satisfied of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>That gentleman was the ablest of the <orgName n="Southern Union" type="union">Southern Union</orgName> party in the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> before secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He has proved himself to be <num value="1">one</num> of the most devoted of them; holding on up to the date of the proclamation to his hope of reconstructing the <rs>Union</rs>, and his aversion to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>That paper has aroused the dormant spirit of State rights and State sovereignty in his heart, and he comes out like a man and a true patriot in their defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He is worth a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He will have worthy compeers standing by him, struggling nobly for that just cause which Northern tyranny and outrage have at last forced him to response. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The next folly of the <rs>Brigand Government</rs> in its war of rapine will be the arming of the slaves by authority from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>That act is an essential part of the brutal policy to which they have been forced by submitting to the pressure of the fanatical public sentiment of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is the next step in the course of degradation and inhumanity of the <rs>Northern Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It will still further help along the cause of the <rs>South</rs> on both sides of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>From the beginning we knew they would invoke all the powers of earth and hell in their war upon us. Their public avowal of their horrid measures do not surprise or alarm us, while we have the benefit of the object of their acknowledgment upon the civilized world as well as upon a large portion of their own people. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> and our Government.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> We constantly see in the <rs>Northern</rs> journals the most mendacious accounts of tyranny and oppression practiced by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, libellous caricatures of the persons who compose the administration, and false statements of their universal unpopularity with the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>From these assumed facts they argue that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is on its last legs, and the <rs>Southern</rs> cause becoming extinct in that which was the only source of strength it ever possessed, the affections and will of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> If all this were ever so true, it might be answered that the same argument would prove the <rs>Federal Government</rs> on its last legs, and the <rs>Union</rs> cause at the point of perdition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Lincoln Government has deprived its people of every vestige of constitutional liberty, thrusts into its dungeons every man who dares to breathe a free thought, and substitutes the rule of the bayonet for the rule of law everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He and his Cabinet are at this moment so unpopular in the <rs>North</rs> that if they were not kept in their places by the army, the storm of suppressed public indignation would scatter them to the <num value="4">four</num> winds of Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Therefore, we might take it for granted that the <rs>Union</rs> cause is near its last end in the <rs>North</rs>, having lost all that ever gave it cohesive power &mdash; the confidence and affections of its people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> But there is another and better reply to the arguments against our Government, by which the <rs>Northern</rs> writers attempt to prove that the rebellion, as they call it, is near its extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is this: <orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> and our Government are <num value="2">two</num> wholly different things; and, though the last were as weak, selfish, and tyrannical, as malignant enemies describe it, the loyalty of our people would not be affected, because they are fighting for a cause, and not for any man or set of men. It was not the <rs>Southern</rs> administration which produced this revolution; it was the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The individuals who compose its Government are but sparks from the great popular locomotive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Or to change the figure, they are but drops of water on the paddle-wheel of the steamboat, which a revolution has brought to the summit, where they remain but a short time, and are consigned again to their native deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If each and every <num value="1">one</num> of them were as dead as <persName n="Caesar,,Julius,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Caesar,Julius,,,"><foreName>Julius</foreName> <surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, the onward course of the <rs>Southern</rs> movement would no more be retarded by it than the <rs>Great Eastern</rs> is by the myriads of phosphorescent stomas which she dashes off in every encounter with the waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It is ridiculous, then, to talk of Southern disaffection on account of the alleged imbecility and selfishness of Southern leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is the country and not the <rs>Government</rs>; it is our homes, our wives and children, our institutions, our honor, and property, and freedom, we are fighting for, and not for any Government, except as the representative and agent of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Were these representatives and agents ever so arrogant and incapable, they could not wean us from the cause, which involves all that makes existence precious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Never was there a revolution which was so universally a revolution of the people as this of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Even the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution itself was not as much so.--There was a large and influential class of the community which opposed that movement from beginning to end. Most of the literary men of the time were its uncompromising antagonists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Many of the men of wealth and of political influence, and numbers of the yeomanry of the day, were opposed to it. What is there in the <rs>South</rs> which can compare with the <name>Toryism</name> of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> the only enemies of our cause are secret enemies, who have never dared to take arms in their hands, and even these are in a minority so pitiful as not to deserve consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The people have given their children, their sons, and brothers, themselves, and all that they have, to the war. If the <rs>Government</rs> has in any degree incurred censure, it has not been by being ahead of, but being behind, the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But whilst no <num value="1">one</num> claims for the agent of the people infallibility, it has conducted its difficult task with a degree of wisdom and prudence which the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>, has not been able, with all its resources, to equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is in vain for the stipendiary tools of Lincolnism to try to sow tares among the wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The people of the <rs>South</rs> are true to themselves, and in that loyalty they are not to be disturbed by the machinations of their enemies. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>On the subject of the proclamation he said: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Loyalty did not depend upon color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Help from the slaves was constitutional, and justified by historical precedents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>An appeal to the slaves should be tried, and he believed that such an appeal would be effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The slaves would be encouraged and the masters discouraged by a panic among them &mdash; The various objections to the proclamation of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to liberals the slaves, were that the <rs>Border States</rs> officers would throw down their arms; that side issues would arise; that there would be slave insurrections, and that the slaves would overflow the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>These questions were considered by him, and he appealed to his audience if he had not answered them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>He believed that success could only be obtained through the emancipation of the slaves, as without a fire in their rear, a united people could not be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The proclamation, he continued, was a herald of peace, and emancipation the best general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Force alone could not conquer without ideas, and for the sake of peace he now plead for freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If the instincts of freedom did not prompt the support of emancipation, the command of the <name>Almighty</name>, to <q>&#x0022;Let His people go free,&#x0022;</q> should have an effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The conclusion that he (<persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,George,J.,,:2"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>) came to was, that by emancipation the war was changed in its character but not in its object, and that it was a war for all mankind. </p> </q><bibl n="Sumner's speech"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Life, liberty and property had been sacrificed, and yet these men are silent about it; but when we defend ourselves against these plotters and scoundrels, and seek to defend the life of the nation, we are told it is unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>(Hisces) Was not time enough given to them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>How much more did they want?--How would the proclamation affect the nation in the matter of foreign intervention?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He had precious little confidence in the aristocracy, the ruling classes of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, whether the <rs>Government</rs> was against slavery or for slavery. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>But what were the facts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>So, whether the nation stood with slavery or against slavery, it made no difference with the <rs>British</rs> aristocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The truth was that the <rs>English</rs> aristocracy desired and were glad to welcome such a state of things, in order that they might establish for themselves a new ground for the production of cotton, and so be independent of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The great republic had been a perpetual thorn in the sides of the aristocracy; and that same influence would keep <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> against us to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>But the laboring classes of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> did sympathize with this, country, and did hope that the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> would be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has issued the proclamation of emancipation, which is to go into effect on the <date value="01-01">1st of January</date> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> There were those who fancied that it would be utterly without effect upon the rebels; that they would feel themselves so secure behind the bayonets of their armies, so confident of the willing obedience of their slaves and of their power to enforce obedience among them, if necessary, that they would only laugh at the proclamation as an impotent penance, and at the <rs>President</rs> for thus sitting as Glint <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> in Pilgrim's Progress sat, <q>&#x0022;grinning and biting his nails&#x0022;</q> at the pilgrims who went by in safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> Others have said that the only effect of it would be to make the rebels issue an edict of immediate emancipation, in order to forestial us, and save for themselves the power which emancipation is sure to bring in this struggle to him who confers it.--But we have never seen any I kelihood of either of these things; and thought it is too soon to speak positively of results, yet thus far the manner in which the rebels have received the proclamation indicates neither result, but the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>So far from being received with indifference, or with <q>&#x0022;rears of laughter,&#x0022;</q> as the proclamation calling out <num value="75000">75,000</num> men was received by them, it has been the signal for a burst of rage which will be remark able in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Every rebel newspaper exploded into curses and threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The fountains of billingsgate could not flow fast enough for them, but choked up from the fullness of their rage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The subject was immediately brought up also in the rebel Congress, and a resolution offered that retaliation be at once resorted to, in order <q>&#x0022;to secure its withdrawal or arrest its execution.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> And so far from turning their thoughts towards emancipation, they have thus far only breathed out threatening and slaughter, not only against us, but also against the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Their thoughts have turned to extermination instead of counter-emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>These threats of retaliation will, as we said, test the firmness of the <rs>Administration</rs>'s nerve; and if we were to judge of the future by the past, we should fear that they would be too much for it &mdash; How was it with the privateers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>We tried them for violations of the law. They had all their rights secured to them, and were legally convicted before a jury of their countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The rebels resorted to retaliation, as they called it: that is, without form or ceremony, they threw our gallant men into dungeons, and threatened to kill them if the just sentence of the law was executed on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Instead of seizing retaliation as really our weapon to meet their throat and overpower it, the <name>Administration</name> left it in the hands of the rebels, and finally yielded the point, released convicted felons from the fate which justly awaited them, and gave them into he hands of their rejoicing fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>We can understand the feelings which led the <name>Administration</name> to do so. The entreaties of friends are hard to resist, and they carried the day; but it may well be that the tender heartiness was mistaken, and has been the cause, in the long run, of more suffering and misery than a sterner policy would have produced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> The same course was again pursued in reference to the officers of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, not, however, with as complete success,--and the same course will be adopted again in reference to this emancipation policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The rebels know that it is fatal to them, and they will strive by every exhibition of ferocity and cruelty <q>&#x0022;to secure its withdrawal or arrest its execution.&#x0022;</q> They must not succeed.--<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has <q>&#x0022;put his foot down&#x0022;</q> firmly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>He must keep it down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Tenderheartedness is out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It will only be the cause of untold and prolonged miseries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>As it is, the struggle may be fierce, but it cannot be long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>But any change in policy will be hailed as a sign of weakness by our foes at home and our maligners abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Nothing would so much encourage the rebels as their being able to <q>&#x0022;secure the withdrawal&#x0022;</q> of that proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They would wade through seas of blood to secure it. There is no atrocity which would be too great for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>We shall not follow them in their downward career.--Let them, if they choose, determine to kill every man of ours who falls into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>We shall not kill our prisoners on that account; but our men will fight better for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Our soldiers will not falter; our columns will not be checked in their onward career by all the fury and all the atrocity which the rebels may exhibit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>We hope that the <name>Administration</name> on its part will show a corresponding firmness, and that its only answer to the furious menaces and barbarous deeds of the rebels will be <q> &#x0022;Push on the columns &mdash; Liberty and Union now and forever!&#x0022;</q> </p> </q><bibl n="The Times"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>The pretence that enlistments are to be discouraged, and that the national front against the rebels is to be weakened by the freest discussion on the platform and at the polls of the course and policy of the <name>Administration</name>, is as shallow as it is impertinent.--<rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens enlist in this war, we beg <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,H.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> to understand, not because they know or care anything about him, the casual <rs>Secretary</rs> of an elective <rs type="role2">President</rs>, but because they love their country and are determined to aid in rescuing it from a great and terrible peril in the only way in which it can be rescued &mdash; by the intelligent, independent devotion of its sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> If the <rs>Government</rs> wishes to see how enlistments can really be discouraged, and the national front really weakened in this war, it has only to silence criticism by force, and to attempt to impose upon a free people, in the form of executive edicts, great measures of war and State which its putty requires it to submit to popular discussion and to the final decision of the popular voice. </p>
