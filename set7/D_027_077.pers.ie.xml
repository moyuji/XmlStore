<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> On <num value="2">two</num> occasions within the past week a <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, defending a most important portion of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and conducting itself, so far as its infantry and artillery were concerned, with all the gallantry natural to it, has been defeated and compelled to fall back by the conduct of the cavalry placed to cover <num value="1">one</num> of its wings, which appears to have given way almost as soon as proposing cavalry of the enemy made its appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>This circumstance naturally revives an inquiry with which the public journals were rife but a year ago, and which it is of the last importance to pash to something like a definite answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Why is it that our cavalry has, throughout this war, proved so obviously inferior in efficiency to both the other arms of the service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Why is it that, in point of fact, it has never, on any occasion, played the <hi rend="italics">role</hi> which has always heretofore been thought to be peculiarly its own?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Why is it that in an army containing <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon <num value="1000">thousands</num> of soldiers who have been in the habit of backing and riding the wildest horses from their boyhood, and who are, in truth, among the best riders in the world, there should be absolutely no cavalry, if we are to understand by that term such a species of force as goes by that name in every army of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>? &#x0022;It is, &#x0022; says <persName n="Sehaller,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Sehaller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Sehaller</surname></persName>, &#x0022;the only weapon which can take advantage of a beaten enemy, pursue and rout him. Hence it has been fostered and trained in every well-regulated military system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Frederic the <rs>Great</rs> owes his most signal victories to the impetuous attacks of his Hussars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> hurled his masses of heavy cavalry against the decisive point, and felt assured of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The Polish cavalry dashed into many a Russian square in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The cavalry charges of <placeName reg="Inkerman, Hardy, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118708">Inkerman</placeName> and Balaclava are immortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>On the plains of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, both French and <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> horsemen, in the late war, performed prodigies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>And all these bright deeds of arms were performed by men who had to be taught to ride <hi rend="italics">after they were <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of age, and upon horses that had been broken by riding-masters who themselves would not have dared to mount a wild young horse, as our cavalrists do.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> The fact is, our cavalry have degenerated into what <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName> calls, in the same work to which the above extract is part of a note, &#x0022;dragoons.&#x0022; Of these, the same author says, &#x0022;in principle, they are entirely mounted infantry; they ought always to have preserved this character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>In <hi rend="italics">that</hi> capacity, dragoons can render, in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> circumstances immense services; such as detachments for surprises in retrograde movements, and, above all, in pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>But it would be necessary, in conformity to their constitution, to mount them upon horses too small to be placed in line, otherwise the aspirations and pretensions of colonels will soon convert them into cavalry, and they will then become both <hi rend="italics">bad infantry and bad cavalry.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> So says <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName>; and we have the strongest proof in what is occurring every day in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> that he spoke the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Of cavalry, as such, we have none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Our whole force on horseback is mounted infantry, or, as <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName> calls it, &#x0022;dragoons.&#x0022; It is an amphibious affair, indeed; neither cavalry nor infantry, but partaking of the worst points of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The superior skill of our countrymen in riding is absolutely thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The <hi rend="italics">spur</hi> which <persName><foreName>Frederic</foreName></persName> taught his cavalry to depend on is of no use except in getting out of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The sabre is never used at all. The men ride up and fire their revolvers; and this they are taught to call charging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The actual shock of cavalry combat, where force meets force in the headlong charge, is utterly unknown to our system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The so-called cavalry dismount, dig a ditch, or get behind trees and pop away at each other after he fashion of <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> fighters in the impenetrable forests of the far <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It is no wonder that horsemen thus trained should give way upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> symptom of a <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>How different was <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName>'s idea of what cavalry ought to be when he wrote the following: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Horsemanship is everything!</hi> It subjugates and breaks the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Man&#x0153;uvres will always be performed with sufficient correctness when the soldiers are good horsemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Encouragement of all kinds should be given to obtain this result.&#x0022; Our troops want no encouragement whatever to make them form themselves into good horsemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>They are such already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>They constitute such a body of riders as the world never saw. But all this is utterly thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>A very indifferent horseman would answer all the ends of our drill as well as the most splendid rider in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>He can ride up, fire off a revolver, wheel to the right about, and gallop away; or he can throw the bridle of his horse to some comrade, dismount, take a tree, and pop away like an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>We are told that the nature of our country is such that our cavalry cannot charge as in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/><orgName n="Tariton's Legion"><persName n="Tariton,Legion,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Tariton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Legion"></roleName><surname>Tariton</surname></persName>'s Legion</orgName>, then, was all a myth, we suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>There never was such a body of troops as the <rs>Queen</rs>'s Rangers, under <persName n="Simcoe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Simcoe,nomatch:0"><surname>Simcoe</surname></persName>. --<orgName n="Legion"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s Legion</orgName> was the fabrication of some crazy rebel during the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Tariton did not charge <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> at the <name>Cowpens</name>, and <persName n="Washington,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="default:Washington,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> did not charge Tariton in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> did not charge Tariton in the lane in front of <placeName reg="Guilford, New Haven, Connecticut" key="tgn,2016959">Guilford</placeName> just before the battle, and Tariton did not charge our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> (in the woods, too,) at that battle under cover of the smoke raised by a body of infantry who fired especially for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>These are all inventions &mdash; pure inventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The country would not have admitted any of these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It was infinitely more wooded then than it is now. Of course it could not have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>When we read, therefore, that Tariton charged the disordered ranks of <persName n="Gates,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Gates,nomatch:0"><surname>Gates</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Camden, Kershaw, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095449">Camden</placeName>, and produced an irrepressible stampede, and that he pursued the fugitives for miles upon miles, cutting them down by the dozen at every step, we are reading of something altogether imaginary &mdash; something existing only in the heated fancies of the writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The men who came from the <name>Waxhaw</name> settlements to a certain court-house, not many miles from this city, and there exhibited the terrible wounds that Tariton's men had inflicted in charging them, lied of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The face of the country was very woody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>How could Tariton charge there? </p> </q><bibl n="Marmont's idea"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> We believe the excuse about the nature of the country to be utterly unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>An author whom we have quoted before--<persName n="Schaller,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Schaller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Schaller</surname></persName>--pronounces it to be so in the following words: <q>&#x0022;No instances of what cavalry can do are necessary; history furnishes <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them; and if <num value="1">one</num> would contend that the nature of the ground with us is such as to forbid anything like a charge or effective pursuit, he but shows ignorance of the topography of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> battle-fields!&#x0022;</q> There it is, the whole truth, we doubt not. To tell us at this time of day that cavalry cannot charge and pursue in the countries where Tariton and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> charged and pursued <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> ago is preposterous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> Our men want nothing more than to be taught the use of the sabre, and the practice of charging with that weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Among the mounted men let there be a portion, at least, of these; and they the best riders, on the best horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Do not make mounted infantry of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the cavalry force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Let every squadron have a certain number of mounted infantry, say <num value="40">forty</num>, as <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName> advises in his book, which <persName n="Schaller,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Schaller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Schaller</surname></persName> has translated expressly for the use of our army, and which has the seal of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00123" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s approbation, and, we understand, of most other military men. Let the cavalry be made cavalry sure enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>We have very good officers; such as <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fitz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Fitz,nomatch:0"><surname>Fitz</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wickham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Wickham,nomatch:0"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName>, &#x0026;c. Let them be instructed to teach their men the use of the sabre, or to have it taught, and the evolutions necessary for cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Then, when we inflict another defeat on the enemy, there may be some hope of throwing a body of cavalry upon his disordered forces and gaining a decisive victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Then we shall have no more long, murderous, indecisive battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Then there will be bodies of troops who both can and will protect the country from pillage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of our commanders who shall teach his men to trust to the <hi rend="italics">spur</hi> for victory will find himself suddenly occupying a niche in the temple of fame alongside of Siedlitz and <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName>. </p> </div3>
