<head>The sequestration law.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Timid politicians contend that a law of confiscation, passed by the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName>, would disgrace our young Republic in the eyes of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They insist that we must be very careful what we do, lest we commit some act displeasing to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They would shape the whole conduct of the war and policy of the <rs>Government</rs> as if we were on trial for good behavior before mankind at large, and before the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> public in particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We must remain passively defensive in every formand manner; we must oppose the mere <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">vitinertia</hi></foreign> of our Government and army to the assaults of the enemy; we must carefully avoid injuring the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> too much, lest they get mad and become too exasperated to make peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The whole thought of this non-combatant party, who are the censors of our public councils, is <q>&#x0022;how not to do&#x0022;</q> anything effective and decisive; how to fight the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> without damaging their interests or wounding their pride; how to keep open the chance of peace and reconciliation, while continuing the pretense of war. To carry out their principles, if engaged in a personal collision, they would forbear to strike their adversary <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and would always wait till he delivered his blow; they would then return it, and confine themselves to a strict retort of his licks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They would note exactly how often, and when, and how hard, they had been struck, and reply, tit for tat, in the same identical measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is not allowable, according to their view, to injure or weaken the enemy except in some mode in which he has already injured and weakened us. If the enemy pulls our nose, then, and not till then, we may resent his insult; but we must only do it by pulling his nose in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>If he knocks us down, we may then legally, and with the approbation of the civilized world, knock him down too, if we be not disabled from doing so. But, after he had twitched our nose, or spit in our face, it would be an unheard of enormity, if we should let fly at him with the left, <hi rend="italics">a la</hi> <persName n="Heenan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Heenan,nomatch:0"><surname>Heenan</surname></persName>, and floor him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, thus has subjugated for mere empire a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of people; <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName>, who conquered and partitioned <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>; <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, who utterly destroyed <num value="2">two</num> civilized nations; and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, who made war against the world &mdash; would say we had done wrong if we struck our enemy except in retort; and even <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> would denounce us as savages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Because the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> has as yet passed no general bill of confiscation, the refore, it is insisted by this class of legislative warriors, that we should pass none either; even though, as is the case, the <rs>Northern Executive</rs> and army have been engaged for more than a year in the work of actual confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>That, however, is denied to be legislative confiscation, and therefore, it is maintained, we must not reply with legislative confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>And this is their argument when the enemy is invading us with an army of <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men and a navy of <num value="300">three hundred</num> ships! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Such spring-like days will soon work a great change upon the face of Nature, if this balmy temperature and this bright, warm sunshine continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The blue birds are already singing in the fields and among the leafless branches of the trees; spring flowers are lifting their heads above the ground, and the sward by the hill-side, close by the dancing rill, is already changing its dingy color to the rich hue of Nature, so pleasing to the eye. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> It is so calm that the whole surface of our wide and deep harbor resembles a vast miror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Occasionally a steamer passes along, and raises a few wavelets that go rippling and dancing to the shore, and sparkling in the sunshine like <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> polished diamonds. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The sale of the cargo did not average more than about <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure> peer sack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> We continued to sell rather lower than current rates; our house, in fact, kept down the price of salt in <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We closed up the cargo the last of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, by selling from <num value="500">five hundred</num> to <measure n="700sacks" type="mass">seven hundred sacks</measure> at <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">$7</measure> to <measure n="7.50dollars" type="currency">$7.50</measure> per sack; a few sacks at <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">$8</measure> and <measure n="8.50dollars" type="currency">$8.50</measure>, and yet the whole a verage of the sales did not exceed more than is stated above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The <orgName n="Railroad Company" type="company">railroad company</orgName>, strange to say, refused to transport a portion of this salt, and they sold it where it was stored at <measure n="14dollars" type="currency">$14</measure> to <measure n="14.50dollars" type="currency">$14.50</measure>; we, only a few days after our sale, bought <measure n="30sacks" type="mass">thirty sacks</measure> of this salt from <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Martin,nomatch:0"><surname>Martin</surname></persName>, <orgName type="company"><persName n="Tannahill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Tannahill,nomatch:0"><surname>Tannahill</surname></persName> and Co.</orgName>, to fill an order in this city, at <measure n="15.50dollars" type="currency">$15.50</measure>. Neither they nor I were extortioners, according to mercantile or moral laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>As price advanced, we bought salt in other markets, thus increasing the supply in our city, and of course keep prices down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>We bought about <measure n="3000sacks" type="mass">three thousand sacks</measure> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> salt, which we sold at <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, Norforld, and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> We bought the salt to make money, believing it would be very high; and, having this opinion, adviced many persons to buy in the months of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct>, and <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Now, air, if I had been mercenary or extortionate, as I am insidiously accused, surely I would have acted very differently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Supply and demand fix the price of everything in times of war as well as in peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> Many of the traducers of their neighbors seem to lose sight of the fact altogether that salt at <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> per sack, when bacon is selling at <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> per pound, is cheaper than salt at <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">$2</measure> and bacon at <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure>. It costs no more to fatten hogs now than it did last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>And no men is considered extortionate who sells his bacon at <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or even <measure n="30cents" type="currency">thirty cents</measure>-in fact, I sold bacon at <measure n="30cents" type="currency">thirty cents</measure> for a consigner, and he has not complained of me as an extortioner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Those who menifest displeasure and scorn, would appear disinterested and magnanimous by classing with me their own factors and merchants, their own short-sighted calculations as to the opening of the ports, an the ports, and the newspaper scribbiers, who said said there was an abundance of salt inthe country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>We consider all of the out-givings of the press, thus represented through the polished channels of the corrupt, Northern Journals, as entitied to very little weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The popular sentlment of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, inevitably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The approaching session of parliament will show it; and, in the meanwhile, the continued military preparation of the <rs>British Government</rs> is a circumstance not to be regarded as insignificant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/> As for the <rs>Times</rs>, it is a very powerful, yet a very inconsistent and unprincipled newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>It has neither a soul nor corporality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>So that, while the <rs>Times</rs> is a paper of great energy, great ability, it has no sort of sensibility, no sense of justice, no character for consistancy, sincerity, or fair dealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> In addition to the numerous designs for a Confederate flag, already on your table, permit me to offer <num value="1">one</num> embracing both stars and sun, which afford so exact a type of the relations of our State and general Government toward each other, that the seeming incongruity in their presence on the same field may be pardoned, especially when we reflect that they are really always present together, the <num value="1">one</num> overshadowing only, not blotting out the others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/> The stars in this design, then, are intended to represent the individuality of the <name>States</name>, shining, each in its own sphere, with a radiance steady and serene, though pale in comparison with the effulgence of the rising sun, the emblem of their united sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The number of stars, and (if seen fit) of sun-rays, correspond to the number of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The red field and dark band of clouds denote the period of blood, darkness, and trial, through which we are now struggling; the white, the region of peace and prosperity, into which we expect, with the blessing of Heaven, soon to emerge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/> This design is so unlike that of any other flag that floats, especially the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, as to be unmistakable; while it enables us still to assert our claim to the <q>&#x0022;<orgName n="Star Spangled Banner" type="newspaper">Star Spangled Banner</orgName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/> For a national coat of arms I would suggest a Shield <q>&#x0022;Argent,&#x0022;</q> charged with stars, in number as above, upon a blue belt:--The crest a <placeName key="tgn,2033454" n="1.000 3" reg="rising sun, ohio, indiana">Rising Sun</placeName> emerging from clouds:--and for a motto, the words <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">In <persName n="Deo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Deo,nomatch:0"><surname>Deo</surname></persName>,</hi>&#x0022;</q> as expressive, in the fewest possible words, of a sentiment inappropriate to no people or time, but <hi rend="italics">peculiarly appropriate</hi> to a people undergoing the baptism of fire that marks the birth of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/> Our coins (for we must abolish as speedily as possible the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> currency,) might show upon the obverse side the crest as above, rimmed with stars equal in number to the number of States--with the motto beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>On the reverse, the date and value, enclosed in a wreath of foliage and fruits of some of the most important productions of our country: such as wheat, cotton, corn, rice, cane, and tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>These hasty suggestions are thrown out for what they are worth, in the hope they may at least lead to something better, and that speedily; for these outward signs and symbols of nationality, small matter as they seem, are really of vast importance; and a flag to fight under, and to <hi rend="italics">learn to love,</hi> is now almost our greatest need. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/> Before closing, let me add a hearty endorsement of the proposition emanating from a writer in <q>&#x0022;<persName n="De Bow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="mostcommon:De Bow,nomatch:0"><surname>De Bow</surname></persName>'s Review,&#x0022;</q> that, in adopting a new coinage, not only its devices, but its names and values, and indeed our whole system of weights and measures constituting our <hi rend="italics">trade language,</hi> should be radically altered for the sake of the wider and surer separation from the accursed <q>&#x0022;Yankee&#x0022;</q> to which such a change would materially conduce.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> When I say his country's cause, not only do I mean those sublime abstractions which constitute the home of the philosopher and statesman; <q>&#x0022;Patria&#x0022;</q> for them means that everlasting succession in a portion of the human race possessing the same soil, speaking the same language, living under the same laws, and who, not being subject to death, perpetuates itself in its revolving motions as an immortal man who has <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the beginning and the end of all things; but yet I refer to something more sensual, more material, to something that lays closer to the patriot's heart &mdash; I refer to that which has been the love of his soul, of his whole soul, during his whole life: his fireside, his home, his family. </p>
