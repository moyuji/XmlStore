<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> From an official dispatch received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> yesterday morning it appears that the <rs>Confederate</rs> force which threatened <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> last, recrossed the <rs>Potomac</rs> on the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="2">14th</day></dateStruct>, bringing off everything safely and in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The dispatch further states that our loss during the invasion of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> was slight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The results of the expedition may be summed up as follows: A terrible fright of the <name>Lincolnites</name>, who for some days considered their capital in danger; and indeed the <rs>Washington</rs> <hi rend="italics">Chronicle</hi> admit that there were periods between <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> when the rebels might have dashed into <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and effected its capture, if not its occupation; the capture of a large number of cattle, horses, and a considerable amount of other property, the destruction of railroads and bridge's, and the withdrawals a portion of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> from the front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The apprehension that the &#x0022;raid&#x0022; will be repeated will doubtless keep the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in a constant state of anxiety, and cause them to keep <num value="2">two</num> or <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">three corps</orgName> of their &#x0022;veterans&#x0022; at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for the protection of the capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> We understand that our forces crossed the <rs>Potomac</rs> at <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">White's Ford</placeName>, a point a few miles below <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg, in Loudoun county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There was no pursuit, and the crossing was elected without difficulty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The Federal force believed to have been in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> and <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Wright,nomatch:0"><surname>Wright</surname></persName>'s <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num> (formerly <persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>'s) <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, and <orgName type="corps" n="corps 4"><persName n="Rickett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Rickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Rickett</surname></persName>'s Fourth army corps</orgName> from <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> There was some picket firing along the lines on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, which at times became quite rapid, but nothing approaching a battle occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The enemy continues his pastime of throwing shell into the city but if we except the disfigurement of a few houses and annoyance of non combatants, he has accomplished nothing by this barbarous and uncivilized practice. </p>

And at still another point a picket volunteered the information that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had been wounded in the arm by <num value="1">one</num> of our mortar shells, and died from the effects of amputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The statements of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers must be taken with many grains of allowance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We place but little confidence in them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the citizens of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> were startled by the reports of heavy guns, which were subsequently ascertained to have proceeded from the enemy's batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>They did not damage. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> <num value="6">Six</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners, captured on the right of our lines on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, were brought to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> last evening and duly quartered at the <name>Libby</name>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> We saw yesterday <num value="2">two</num> officers of artillery stationed on the north side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>; below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> We learned however, that our batteries on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> opened on the <rs>Federal</rs> <term type="ship">gunboat</term> <rs type="ship">Hunchback</rs>, and struck her <num value="3">three</num> times, when she withdrew to the protection of the bluffs in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The pontoon bridge and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> camp, which were in full view, were then shelled, and, as it appears, with some effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The Federal troops at the camp were seen double-clicking it to the shelter of their works, and, it is supposed, remained under arms all day, in the apprehension of an attack. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Several shots were fired without effect. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Our batteries opened on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> upon the enemy's pontoon bridge and camp, killing a number of horses and causing a hasty skedaddling of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> generally. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> We had an interview yesterday with a gentleman who accompanied <orgName n="command"><persName n="Morgan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> on its recent expedition to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The object of this movement, it appears, was to prevent a raid of the enemy, under <persName n="Hobson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Hobson,nomatch:0"><surname>Hobson</surname></persName>, upon the salt works and lead mines in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and proved a complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>On the <date value="06-07">7th of June</date> <orgName n="command"><persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,Gen,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> engaged the enemy, <num value="700">seven hundred</num> strong, at <placeName reg="Payne Gap, Letcher, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040707">Pound Gap</placeName>, and routed them, pursuing them <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> and causing them to destroy their stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They next made a dash on <placeName reg="Mount Sterling, Montgomery, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040401">Mount Sterling</placeName>, and <measure n="400" type="captured">captured four hundred</measure> of the enemy and large supplies of military and medical stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><num value="3">Three</num> nights afterward they captured <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, where they succeeded in obtaining <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> horses, a sufficient number to mount the entire command and supply the places of broken down and jaded animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Advancing then upon <placeName key="tgn,2038431" n="1.000 35" reg="cynthiana, harrison, kentucky">Cynthiana</placeName>, the enemy took refuge in the houses, and a portion of the town was burnt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>On the afternoon of the same day <persName n="Hobson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hobson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hobson</surname></persName> came up from <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> with <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>These men were surrounded, and surrendered without unnecessary delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The next morning <orgName n="command"><persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,Gen,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> commenced the return to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and safely brought off the ambulance train with the wounded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He was to have a large force and <num value="12">twelve</num> pieces of artillery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> While the above mentioned operations were in progress, detachments of troops were sent to the railroads, and succeeded in cutting them in <num value="5">five</num> different places. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They were paroled at different points in the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> State, so that they could not readily reorganize. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> In less than <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> this expedition marched <measure n="750miles" type="distance">seven hundred and fifty miles</measure>, performed an immense amount of work, and prevented the <sic>fullfilment</sic> of a design which, had it succeeded, could not have been otherwise than disastrous to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and indeed the whole Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>But they never for a moment Jolluded the eyes of cool and calm spectators at a distance to the actual state of the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>If <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was uniformly successful, and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> uniformly defeated, why, they asked, was not <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> destroyed and the object of the campaign obtained by the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>If victory has attended on <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s banner, where are its fruits?--Has a single object of the campaign been accomplished, and if not, what good has resulted to the <rs>Federal</rs> cause from so much slaughter and so many triumphs, if triumphs they can be called?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>In this spirit the <rs>London</rs> <hi rend="italics">Standard </hi> denies to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> all claim to be considered a General. &#x0022;He is,&#x0022; says that journal, &#x0022;but an infant in the hands of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>He has so many <num value="1000">thousands</num> or hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men placed under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>His way of utilizing the unhappy raw material is to hurl it against the enemy, regardless altogether of the loss of life.-- As Federal <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are estimated over there by the magnitude of their achievements in this line, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> must now be a hero of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Up to the <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> the <rs>Federal</rs> report confesses to a loss of <num value="40000">40,000</num> in <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure>--<measure n="40000" type="killed, wounded, and missing">40,000 killed, wounded, and missing</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>He attempts to outnumber his opponent; he is himself outnumbered by a dexterous combination of forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>He gives him battle, and is defeated; his <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> is scattered, his centre broken; <num value="2">two</num> whole brigades of his army captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>He attempts to drive him from his road to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; his opponent, after beating him, takes up, at his leisure, <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest positions in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and barring the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>He directs <num value="1">one</num> of his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to turn the right flank of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and finds on a sudden, to his dismay, that his own right flank has been turned, the enemy is behind him, and his baggage and supply train has gone before him to the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>He halts for a day to secure his communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The next thing heard of is a heavy cannonading near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and it is rumored that the road to Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> has been interrupted and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>During all this time he loses <num value="40000">40,000</num> men, among them <num value="8">eight</num> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> and an immense number of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Such a tissue of blunders has not been heard of since the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is confessed by this time that the <rs>North</rs> has no match for <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. There is mourning now in New York, but there is joy in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> Such is a view of this campaign, given by an English newspaper, after having read the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts and none other, for so the writer expressly states in the commencement of this article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>That the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers did not give half of their losses during that terrible week, it is perfectly reasonable to infer, not only from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> habit of suppressing the truth and suggesting a falsehood upon all occasions when it suits their purpose, but from facts that have since come to light, in spite of every attempt to conceal them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>From intelligence received in this city, from a source the perfect authenticity of which it is impossible to doubt, it is known that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> lost from all causes, previously to crossing <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, <num value="125000">125,000</num> men, and that but for the reinforcements which <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> sent to him, his army would have been literally and absolutely destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>These reinforcements amounted to <num value="85000">85,000</num> men, if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts are to be trusted, so that he was <num value="40000">40,000</num> men out of pocket when he began his march from <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>In the battle of <placeName reg="Borodino, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,2068136">Borodino</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> contending armies in <num value="1">one</num> day, lost an aggregate of probably <num value="90000">90,000</num> men. But then it was a grand pitched battle, in which the whole force on beth sides was engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>In the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>, which lasted <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, the aggregate of loss on both sides, was probably as great as the loss of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">single</hi> army in this campaign of a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Now these <num value="2">two</num> were the most murderous battles of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>In the month which ended with <placeName reg="Borodino, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,2068136">Borodino</placeName>, the <rs>Russian</rs> army had lost nothing like the number of men <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> lost in the month ending the <date value="1864-06-31">31 of June, 1864.</date> The same may be said of the month ending with the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The <rs>Russians</rs> estimate the loss of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s army in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> at <num value="330000">330,000</num> men the greater part perishing from the inclemency of the climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, on the contrary, says he lost but <num value="200000">200,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We shall not stop to inquire which of these statements is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>But it must be observed that the loss, be it what it may have been, to be distributed over a period of <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure>. No <num value="1">one</num> month can be put in comparison with this bloody month of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s. As for the other campaigns of the <rs>French</rs> revolutionary wars, they scarcely deserve to be named on the same day. All other campaigns, indeed, since the <name>Crusades</name>, sink into bloodless insignificance in comparison with it. We have not the slightest doubt that <hi rend="italics">up to this moment </hi> <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has lost <num value="150000">150,000</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> In singular contrast have been the losses of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Since war <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> became a science we do not believe that in a contest between veterans there was ever so great a contrast with respect to casualties. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> We are happy to say that we believe the rumor in circulation yesterday and <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, with regard to the death of this man, is altogether without foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We cannot afford to loss him just now. Were he killed, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would attribute to his death the stupendous failure they are about to make, and we wish them to have no apology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Besides, no General has ever played so handsomely into our hands, has exposed the lives of his men so frankly in impossible enterprises, or obtained such small results from such enormous means.--We might be worsted but could not be bettered, and therefore we are unwilling to part with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<head>Military successes.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> Without military successes, said <persName n="Chase,Mister-Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister-Secretary">Mr. Secretary</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, he could not promise much improvement of the finances of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The military successes did not come and the <rs>Secretary</rs> went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/><persName n="Fessenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Fessenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fessenden</surname></persName>, a man of abilities, is his successor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But it was not from want of abilities that <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> was compelled to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>It was the same want which <persName n="Fessenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Fessenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fessenden</surname></persName> will have to encounter &mdash; a want which no civilian can supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> Military successes, even if achieved, can only give temporary relief to the finances of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They must totally crush this rebellion, and break forever the spirit of a free people, before they can expect the exhausting drain upon their treasury to cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>But suppose the military successes continue to be on the <rs>Confederate</rs> side?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>What becomes of Northern finances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>What, in other words, becomes of the war? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> We hear of renewed disaffection in the <rs>Northwest</rs>, of increasing dissatisfaction every where with the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>, of bold and indignant denouncements of it, uttered with impunity, which not long ago would have sent the authors of such sentiments to a dungeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>We even catch faint whispers from different quarters of armistices and conciliation, and see something like a dove struggling afar off in the mist and tumult of the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Perhaps it is the <rs>Dove</rs> of Peace, bearing the <rs type="place">Clive branch</rs>, and giving taken of the subsiding of the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>And perhaps it is only a vision of the fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Whatever it may be, we place no confidence in any signs but the <name>Bow</name> of Victory, and when it pleases Heaven to span the whole firmament with that, when that grand triumphal arch shall light up all the dark canopy above, we shall feel sure that the deluge has ceased, never to return. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> With continued military successes on our part, the suppressed discontent of the <rs>Northwest</rs> will manifest itself in an unmistakable form, and the smouldering elements of revolution in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> break out in volcanic fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The Northwest is a mere hewer of wood and drawer of water for <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It loves the <rs>Union</rs>, no doubt, but it is beginning to see that the <rs>Union</rs> between <name>East</name> and <name>West</name> is a partnership for the sole benefit of the <rs>Eastern</rs> member of the firm, and it loves independence better than such a Union as that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The proposed increase of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> tariff must quicken its perceptions on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The injustice which the <rs>West</rs> suffers from such an alliance is aggravated by the fact that, in the war of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> fanaticism, and for <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> interests, the <rs>West</rs> has furnished the best troops and the ablest <rs>Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It has also common sense enough to know that all its interests are with the <rs>South</rs>, and that if it manfully cuts loose from <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, it will have not only the freedom of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, but advantages of trade which can never, by any possibility, accrue to that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The Peace Party not only in the <rs>West</rs>, but in all sections of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, feeble and unimportant as it seems, would prove a much stronger party than is generally supposed if it could have a free utterance of its opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>A fresh application of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s draft will only increase the profound latent disgust of a vast portion of the population for the war. We make all allowances for the traditional idolatry of the <rs>Union</rs>, but when the <name>Idol</name> demands such bloody and long continued sacrifices: when a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men have already gone down his voracious maw, and with unabated appetite he cries for fresh victims; when he devours all the costly offerings heaped upon his shrine, and answers none of the prayers of the worshippers, but, instead thereof, visits them with disaster, sorrow, bankruptcy and shame, his votaries must soon begin to doubt whether they are not bowing down at the altar of a false and ferocious demon, instead of a true <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.--Yet all the explosive materials accumulated in the magazines of Northern society will be of no avail to us till the sparks of our victorious battle fields are scattered among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>With decisive military successes here, there will be political successes there which will put an end to the war. Soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, it is for you, with the blessing of Heaven, to decide how long this war shall last, and then you can return to your homes in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We need not mention these things to inspire your courage, but to invoke you to the rigid exercise of those military virtues which are not subordinate in importance to the most magnificent heroism &mdash; to strict discipline, to eternal watchfulness, to the most perfect and systematic performance of every minor detail of a soldier's duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Let us never permit ourselves to despise any more than to overrate the capacity of our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Let us never heavy again of surprises of the failure of officers to carry out orders, of consummate plans defeated by the shortcomings of the agents to whom they are intrusted.
