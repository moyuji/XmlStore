<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>I did hope that the victory won by our fathers in the days which tried men's snouts, when <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> endeavored in vain to subjugate us, would have proved a lasting <num value="1">one</num>, but alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Now it is obvious, upon very little reflection, that a badge which becomes known to the enemy, either by being published in a paper, or by any other means of communication, must expose those who adopt it to infinite danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The latter unscrupulously resorted to the expedient of wearing the identical badge, at the same time adopting another, by which its, own members could readily distinguish each other, but which was not sufficiently conspicuous to be recognized as a mark of distinction by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Had the expected collision, under such circumstances, taken place, the weapons of the betrayed party, if used at all, must have been used equally against friend and Foe, and its badge would have insured its own destruction, or placed it at the mercy of its enemies. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/> Having been convened on an extraordinary occasion, as authorized by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, your attention is not called to any ordinary subject of legislation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> At the beginning of the present Presidential term, <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> ago, the functions of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> were found to be generally suspended within the several States of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, excepting those only of the <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post-Office Department</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/> Within these States all the forts, arsenals, dock-yards, custom-houses and the like, including the moveable and stationary property in and about them, had been seized and held in open hostility to this Government; excepting only <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Forts Pickens</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7021537" n="1.000 4" reg="key west, florida keys, monroe, florida">Taylor</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Jefferson, Monroe, Florida" key="tgn,2335347">Jefferson</placeName>, on and near the <rs type="place">Florida coast</rs>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/> The forts thus seized had been put in improved condition, new ones had been built, and armed forces had been organized, and were organizing, all avowedly with the same hostile purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The forts remaining in the possession of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in and near these States were either besieged or mentioned by warlike preparations, and especially <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was nearly surrounded by well protected hostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and outnumbering the latter as, perhaps, <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/> A disproportionate share of the <rs>Federal</rs> muskets and rifles had somehow found their say into these States, and had been seized to be used against the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>Accumulations of the public revenue lying within them had been seized for the same object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>The Navy was scattered in distant seas, leaving but a very small part of it within the immediate reach of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/><rs type="role" reg="Officer">Officers</rs> of the <rs>Federal</rs> army and navy had resigned in great numbers, and of those resigning a large <unclear>protection</unclear> had taken up arms against the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/> Simultaneously, and in connection with all this, the purpose to sever the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> was openly avowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>In accordance with this purpose an ordinance had been adopted in each of these States, declaring these States respectively to be separated from the <rs>National</rs> <unclear></unclear>. A formula for instituting a combined Government of these States had been promulgated and this illegal organization, in the character of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, was already invoking recognition, aid and intervention from foreign powers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/> Finding this condition of things, and believing it to be an imperative duty upon the incoming Executive to prevent, if possible, the consummation of such an attempt to destroy the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, a choice of means to that and became indispensable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/> This choice was made and declared in the inaugural address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The policy chosen looked as the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>It sought only to hold the public places and property not already wrested from the <rs>Government</rs>, and to collect the revenues, relying on the rest for time, discussion and the ballot box. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> It promised a continuance of the mails at Government expense to the very people who were resisting the <rs>Government</rs>, and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the people or any of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Of all that a President might constitutionally and <unclear>profitably</unclear> do in such a case, everything was forgone without which it was deemed possible to keep the <rs>Government</rs> on foot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> On the <date value="03-05">5th of March,</date> the present incumbent's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> full day in office, a letter from <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00487" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, commanding at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, written on the <date value="02-28">28th of February,</date> and received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> on the <date value="03-04">4th of March,</date> was by that Department placed in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>This letter expressed the professional opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown into that fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the limited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding possession of the same, with a force of less than <num value="20000">20,000</num> good and well-disciplined men. This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command, and their memoranda on the subject were made enclosures of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00488" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s letter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/> The whole was immediately laid before <persName n="Scott,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00489" reg="nearbymention:Scott,S.,S.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who at once concurred with <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00490" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> in opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>On reflection, however, he took full time, consulting with officers both of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy, and at the end of <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> came reluctantly but decidedly to the same conclusion as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>He also stated at the same time last no such sufficient force was then at the control of the <rs>Government</rs>, or could be raised and brought on the ground within the time when the provisions in the fort would be exhausted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/> In a purely military point of view, this reduced the duty of the <name>Administration</name> in the case to the mere matter of getting the garrison safely out of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>It was believed, however, that so to abandon that position under the circumstances would be utterly ruinous; that the necessity under which it was done could not be fully understood; that by many it would be construed as a part of a voluntary policy, that at home it would disorganize the friends of the <rs>Union</rs>, embolden its adversaries, and go far to ensure to the latter a recognition abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>That in fact, it would be our national destruction consummated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>This could not be allowed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/> Starvation was not yet upon the garrisons, and ere it would be reached <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName> might be reinforced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> This last would be a clear indication of policy, and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> as a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>An order was at once directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the <term type="ship">steamship</term> <rs type="ship">Brooklyn</rs> into <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>This order could not go by land, but must take the longer and slower route by sea. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> return news from the order was received just <num value="1">one</num> week before the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The news itself was that the officer commanding the <rs>Sabine</rs>, to which vessel the troops had been transferred from the <rs>Brooklyn</rs>, acting upon some quasi armistice of the late Administration, and of the existence of which the present Administration, up to the time at which the order was dispatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors to fix attention, had refused to land the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>To now reinforce <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>, before a crisis could be reached at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, was impossible rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter named fort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/> In precaution against such a conjuncture, the <rs>Government</rs> had, a few days before, commenced preparing an expedition, as well adapted as might be, relieve <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, which expedition was intended to be ultimately used or not, according to circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The strongest anticipated case for using it was now presented, and it was resolved to send it forward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> As had been intended in this contingency, it was also resolved to notify the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> that he might expect an attempt would be made to provision the fort, and that if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be no effort to throw in men, arms or ammunition without further notice, of in case of an attack upon the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>This notice was accordingly given, whereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fail, without even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/> It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was in no sense a matter of self-defence on the part of the assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>They well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>They knew that they were expressly notified that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> They knew that this Government desired to keep the garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> from active and immediate dissolution, trusting, as herein before stated, to time, discussion and the ballot box for final adjustment; and they <unclear>led</unclear> and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object &mdash; to drive out the visible authority of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, and thus force <unclear></unclear> to immediate dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>That this was their object, the <rs>Executive</rs> well understood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> And having said to them in the inaugural address, <q>&#x0022;you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,&#x0022;</q> he took pass not only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry, as that the world should not be able to misunderstand it. By the affair at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, with its surrounding circumstances, that point was reached. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> Then and thereby the assailants of the <rs>Government</rs> began the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in the fort, sent to that barbor years before for their own protection, and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> In this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country the distinct issue-- immediate dissolution or blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>And this issue embraces more than the fate of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional Republic or Democracy &mdash; a government of the people by the same people &mdash; can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this case, or in other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence, break up their Government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/> It forces us to ask, is there in all Republics this inherent and fatal weakness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Must a government of necessity be too strong for the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power of the <rs>Government</rs>, and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/> This call was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying, surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Yet none of the <name>States</name> commonly called slave States, except <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, gave a regiment through regular State organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>A few regiments have been organized within some others of these States by individual enterprise, and received into the <rs>Government</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Of course the seceded States, so called, and to which <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> had been joined about the time of the inauguration, gave no troops to the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/> The Border States, so called, were not uniform in their action &mdash; some of them being almost for the <rs>Union</rs>, while in others, as <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, the <rs>Union</rs> sentiment was very nearly repressed and silenced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/> The course taken in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was the most remarkable, perhaps the most important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>A Convention elected by the people of that State to consider this very question of disrupting the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> was in session at the <rs>Capital</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> when <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> fell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> To this body the people had chosen a large majority of professed Union men. Almost immediately after the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, many members of that majority went over to the disunion minority, and with them adopted an ordinance for withdrawing the <rs>State</rs> from the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> Whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, or their great resentment at the <rs>Government</rs>'s resistance to that assault, is not definitely known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/> Although they submitted the ordinance for ratification to vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more than a month distant, the <rs>Convention</rs> and the <name>Legislature</name>, which was also in session at the same time and place, with leading men of the <rs>State</rs> not members of either, immediately commenced acting as if the <rs>State</rs> were already out of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> They pused military preparations vigorously forward all over the <rs>State</rs>; they seized the <orgName n="United States Armory" type="org">United States armory</orgName> at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs> at <placeName reg="Gosport, Owen, Indiana" key="tgn,2032008">Gosport</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>; they received, perhaps invited, into their State large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments from the so-called seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>They formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance and co-operation with the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and sent members to their Congress at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>; and, finally, they permitted the insurrectionary Government to be transferred to their Capital at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> The people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> have thus allowed this great insurrection to make its nest within her borders, and this Government has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/> And it has the less regret, as the loyal citizens have, in due form, claimed its protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Those loyal citizens this Government is bound to recognize and protect as being <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/> In the <rs>Border States</rs>, so called &mdash; in fact, the <rs>Middle States</rs>--there are those who favor a policy which they call an armed neutrality; that is, the arming of those States to prevent the <rs>Union</rs> forces passing <num value="1">one</num> way, or the disunion the other, over their soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> This would be disunion completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation; and yet not quite an impassable <num value="1">one</num>, for, under the guise of neutrality, it would tie the hands of the <rs>Union</rs> men and freely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>At a stroke, it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only what proceeds from the external blockade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> It would do for the <name>Disunionists</name> that which, of all things, they most desire &mdash; feed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of their own. It recognizes no fidelity to the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; no obligation to maintain the <rs>Union</rs>; and while very many who have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens, it is nevertheless very injurious in effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> Recurring to the action of the <rs>Government</rs>, it may be stated that at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a call was made for <num value="75000">75,000</num> militia, and rapidly following this a proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings in the nature of a blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>So far all was believed to be strictly legal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> At this point, the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> Other calls were made for volunteers to serve <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, unless sooner discharged, and also for large additions to the regular Army and Navy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>It is believed that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> Soon after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call for militia, it was considered a duty to authorize the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>, in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> or, in other words, to arrest and detain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>This authority has purposely been exercised, but very sparingly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/> Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done under it are questioned, and the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that <num value="1">one</num> who is sworn to take care that the laws be faithfully executed should not himself violate them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/> Of course some consideration was given to the question of power and propriety before this matter was acted upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed were being resisted, and failing of execution in nearly <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the <name>States</name>.--Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to their execution some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty that practically it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should, to a very limited extent, be violated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>To state the question more directly, are all the laws but <num value="1">one</num> to go unexecuted, and the <rs>Government</rs> itself go to pieces lest that <num value="1">one</num> be violated? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/> Even in such a case would not the official oath be broken if the <rs>Government</rs> should be overthrown, when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>But it was not believed that this question was presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>It was not believed that any law was violated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/> The provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs> that the privilege of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require, is equivalent to a provision &mdash; is a provision &mdash; that such privilege may be suspended when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/> It was decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the writ which was authorized to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Now, it is insisted that Congress and not the <rs>Executive</rs> is vested with this power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/> But the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended that in every case danger should run its course until Congress should be called together, the very assembling of which might have been prevented, as was intended in this case by the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>No more extended argument is now offered, as an opinion of some length will probably be presented by the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject, and if any, what, is submitted entirely to the better judgment of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/> The forbearance of this Government had been so extraordinary and so long continued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our <orgName n="National Union" type="newspaper">National Union</orgName> was probable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/> While this, on discovery, gave the <rs>Executive</rs> some concern, he is now happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers, and a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/> The reports of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretaries of the Treasury</rs>, War and Navy will give the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient for your deliberation and action, while the <rs>Executive</rs> and all the <name>Departments</name> will stand ready to supply omissions, or to communicate new facts considered important for you to know. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/> It is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this contest a short and a decisive <num value="1">one</num>; that you place at the control of the <rs>Government</rs> for the work at least <num value="400000">400,000</num> men and <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure>. That number of men is about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of those of proper ages within the regions where apparently all are willing to engage; and the sum is less than the <num value="23" type="ordinal">twenty-third</num> part of the money value owned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/> A debt of <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> of dollars now is a less sum per head than was the debt of our Revolution when we came out of that struggle; and the money value in the country now bears even a greater proportion to what it was then than does the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Surely each man has as strong a motive now to preserve our liberties as each had then to establish them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/> A right result, at this time, will be worth more to the world than <num value="10">ten</num> times the men and <num value="10">ten</num> times the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>The evidence reaching us from the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant, and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction and the hand of the <rs>Executive</rs> to give it practical shape and efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/><num value="1">One</num> of the greatest perplexities of the <rs>Government</rs> is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>In a word, the people will save their Government, if the <rs>Government</rs> itself will do its part only indifferently well. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/> It might seem at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought to be of little difference whether the present movement at the <rs>South</rs> be called secession or rebellion.--The movers, however, well understood the <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>At the beginning they knew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by any name which implied <hi rend="italics">violation</hi> of law. They knew their people possessed as much of moral sense, and as much of devotion to law and order, and as much pride in and reverence for the history and government of their common country, as any other civilized and patriotic people.--They knew they could make no advancement directly in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments; accordingly they commenced by an insidious debauching of the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>They invented an injurious sophism, which, if conceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps through all the incidents to the complete destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>The sophism itself is, that any State of the <rs>Union</rs> may consistently with the <rs>National Constitution</rs>, and therefore lawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> without the consent of the <rs>Union</rs> or of any other State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> The little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only for just cause, themselves to be the sole judge of its justice, is too thin to merit any notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>With rebellion thus sugar-coated, they have been drugging the public mind of their section for more than <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, and until at length they have brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the <rs>Government</rs> the day after some assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretence of taking their State out of the <rs>Union</rs>, who could have been brought to no such thing the day before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/> This sophism derives much, perhaps the whole of its currency, from the assumption that their is some Omnipotent and Sacred Supremacy pertaining to a State, to each State of our <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Our States have neither more nor less power than that reserved to them in the <rs>Union</rs> by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, no <num value="1">one</num> of them ever having been a State out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>The original ones passed into the <rs>Union</rs> even before they cast off their British Colonial dependence, and the new ones each came into the <rs>Union</rs> directly from a condition of dependence, excepting <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>; and even <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> in its temporary independence was never designated as a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>The new ones only took the designation of States on coming into the <rs>Union</rs>, while that name was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adopted for the old ones in and by the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/> Therein the limited <rs>United Colonies</rs> were declared to be free and independent States, but even then the object plainly was not to declare their independence of <num value="1">one</num> another, or of the <rs>Union</rs>, but directly the contrary, as their mutual pledge and their mutual action before, at the time, and afterwards, abundantly show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>The express plighting of faith by each and all of the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> in the articles of confederation, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> later, that the <rs>Union</rs> shall be perpetual, is most conclusive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/> Having never been States either in substance or in name outside of the <rs>Union</rs>, whence this magical omnipotence of State rights, asserting a claim of power lawfully to destroy the <rs>Union</rs> itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Much is said about the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>, but the word, even, is not in the <rs>National Constitution</rs>, nor, as is believed, in any of the <rs>State Constitutions</rs>.--What is a sovereignty in the political sense of the term?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Would it be far wrong to define it <q>&#x0022;a political community without a political superior?&#x0022;</q> Tested by this, no <num value="1">one</num> of our States except <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> ever was a sovereignty; and even <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> gave up the character on coming into the <rs>Union</rs>, by which act she acknowledged the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and the laws and treaties of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, made in pursuance of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to be for her the supreme law of the land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/> The States have their status in the <rs>Union</rs>, and they have no other legal status.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>If they break from this, they can only do so against law and by revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The Union, and not themselves separately, procured their independence and their liberty; by conquest or purchase the <rs>Union</rs> gave each of them whatever of independence and liberty it has. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/> The Union is older than any of the <name>States</name>, and in fact it created them as States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Originally some dependent colonies made the <rs>Union</rs> and in turn the <rs>Union</rs> threw off their old dependence for them and made them States, such as they are. Not <num value="1">one</num> of them ever had a State Constitution independent of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/> Of course it is not forgotten that all the new States framed their Constitutions before they entered the <rs>Union</rs>, nevertheless dependent upon, and preparatory to coming into the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> Unquestionably the <name>States</name> have the powers and rights reserved to them in and by the <rs>National Constitution</rs>; but among these surely are not included all conceivable powers, however mischievous or destructive; but at most, such only as were known in the world at the time as governmental powers, and certainly a power to destroy the <rs>Government</rs> itself had never been known as a governmental &mdash; as a merely administrative power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>This relative matter of national power and State rights, as a principle, is no other than the principle of generality and locality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/> Whatever concerns the whole should be confided to the whole &mdash; the <rs>General Government</rs>; while whatever concerns only the <rs>State</rs> should be left exclusively to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>This is all there is of original principle about it. Whether the <rs>National Constitution</rs>, in defining the boundaries between the <num value="2">two</num>, has applied the principle with exact accuracy, is not to be questioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>We are all bound by that defining, without question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>What is now combatted is, the position that secession is consistent with the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; is lawful and peaceful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/> It is not contended that there is any express law for it; and nothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> The nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of these States were formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Is it just that they shall go off without leave and without refunding?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The nation paid very large sums, in the aggregate, I believe, nearly <hi rend="italics"><num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num>,</hi> to relieve <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> of the aboriginal tribes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> Is it just that she shall now be off without consent, or without making any return?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>The nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so-called seceding States, in common with the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Is it just, either, that creditors shall go unpaid, or the remaining States pay the whole?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>A part of the present national debt was contracted to pay the old debts of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Is it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> Again, if <num value="1">one</num> State may secede, so may another; and when all shall have seceded, none are left to pay the debts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Is this quite just to creditors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Did we notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/> If we now recognize this doctrine, by allowing the seceders to go in peace, it is difficult to see what we can do if others chose to go, or to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/> The seceders insist that our Constitution admits of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>They have assumed to make a national Constitution of their own, in which necessity they have either discarded or retained the right of secession, as they insist it exists in ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>If they have discarded it, they thereby admit that on principle it ought not to be in ours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/> If they have retained it by their own construction of ours, they show that to be consistent, they must secede from <num value="1">one</num> another whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling their debts, or effecting any other selfish or unjust object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/> The principle itself is <num value="1">one</num> of disintegration, and upon which no government can possibly endure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/> If all the <name>States</name> save <num value="1">one</num> should assert the power to drive that <num value="1">one</num> out of the <rs>Union</rs>, it is presumed the whole class of seceded politicians would at once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon State rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>But suppose that precisely the same act, instead of being called driving the <num value="1">one</num> out, should be called the seceding of the others from that <num value="1">one</num>; it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do, unless, indeed, they make the point that the <num value="1">one</num>, because it is a minority, may rightfully do what the others, because they are a majority, may not rightfully do. These politicians are subtle and profound on the rights of minorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>They are not partial to that power which made the <rs>Constitution</rs> and speaks from the preamble, calling itself, <q>&#x0022;We, the people.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/> It may well be questioned whether there is to-day a majority of the legally qualified voters of any State, except, perhaps, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, in favor of disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>There is much reason to believe that the <rs>Union</rs> men are in the majority in many, if not in every other <num value="1">one</num> of the so-called seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>The contrary has not been demonstrated in any <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>It is ventured to affirm this of even <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>; for the result of an election held in military camps, where the bayonets are all on <num value="1">one</num> side of the question voted upon, can scarcely be considered as demonstrating popular sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>At such an election all that large class who are at once for the <rs>Union</rs> and against coercion would be coerced to vote against the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/> It may be affirmed, without extravagance, that the free institutions we enjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole people beyond any example in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Of this we now have a striking and impressive illustration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/> So large an army as the <rs>Government</rs> has now on foot was never before known, without a soldier in it, but who had taken his place there of his own free choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>But more than this; there are many single regiments whose members, <num value="1">one</num> and another, possess full practical knowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and whatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>And there is scarcely <num value="1">one</num> from which could not be selected a President, a Cabinet, a Congress, and perhaps a Court, abundantly competent to administer the <rs>Government</rs> itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/> Nor do I say this is not true also in the army of our late friends, now adversaries, in this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>But if it is, so much better the reason why the <rs>Government</rs> which has conferred such benefits on both them and us should not be broken up. Whoever, in any section, proposes to abandon such a Government, would do well to consider in deference to what principle it is that he does it; what better he is likely to get in its stead &mdash; whether the substitute will give, or he intended to give, so much of good to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>There are some foreshadowings on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Our adversaries have adopted some declarations of independence in which, unlike the good old <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> by <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00491" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, they omit the words, <q>&#x0022;All men are created equal.&#x0022;</q> Why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>They have adopt- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> ed a temporary National Constitution, in the preamble of which, unlike our good old <num value="1">one</num> signed by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00492" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, they omit <q>&#x0022;We the people&#x0022;</q> and substitute <q>&#x0022;We the <name>Deputies</name> of the <rs>Sovereign</rs> and Independent States.&#x0022;</q>--Why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Why this deliberate pressing out of view the rights of men and the authority of the people? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/> This is essentially a people's contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>On the side of the <rs>Union</rs> it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government, whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial weights from all shoulders, to clear the paths of laudable pursuits for all; to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Yielding to partial and temporary departures, from necessity, this is the leading object of the <rs>Government</rs> for whose existence we contend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>I am most happy to believe that the plain people appreciate this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>It is worthy of note that, while in this, the <rs>Government</rs>'s hour of trial, large numbers of those in the army and navy, who have been favored with the offices, have resigned and proved false to the hand which had pampered them, not <num value="1">one</num> common soldier or common sailor is known to have deserted his flag. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/> A group of lovely girls were assembled in the sitting room of <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> --? busily plying the needle, for they had determined on devoting a portion of each day to sewing for our brave soldiers, and the quick movement of the small fingers, the hum of the machines, and the attention which each paid to her task showed how much they were interested in their undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>I was attracted, particularly, to <num value="1">one</num> of their number whom they called <persName n="Clara,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00540" reg="mostcommon:Clara,nomatch:0"><surname>Clara</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>She was a slight, fair girl of <num value="17">seventeen</num>, and without being strictly handsome, was yet so lovely, and had such a pensive look upon her countenance that my sympathy was instantly enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>When the buzz of conversation had continued for some hours a servant entered with the message, <q>&#x0022;<rs type="role2">Miss</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/> I did not see <persName n="Clara,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00545" reg="mostcommon:Clara,nomatch:0"><surname>Clara</surname></persName> again in <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, and on my <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> visit to the sewing-room while there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/><persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>, who had received sudden orders to return to his post, called at <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> -- to bid <persName n="Clara,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00546" reg="mostcommon:Clara,nomatch:0"><surname>Clara</surname></persName> farewell, and the poor girl, after his departure, could not repress the tears which fell in a silver shower from her eyes.

Her cheeks crimsoned, her eyes flashed, and drawing herself proudly erect, whilst an expression of contempt curled her lips, she exclaimed, <q>&#x0022;Then I would scorn him; do you suppose that I would lavish my love on <num value="1">one</num> who would not protect his rights?&#x0022;</q> and again her form drooped and tears filled the large blue eyes, and I thought to myself, yes, noble girl, and you would sooner have your own young life crushed out by his downfall in the path of duty than that he you love should shrink from the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>And this is the impulse of every true female heart &mdash; to shed proud tears over a fallen hero rather than embrace the loved <num value="1">one</num> living with the brand of coward upon his brow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/> During the days of the battle, poor <persName n="Clara,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00550" reg="mostcommon:Clara,nomatch:0"><surname>Clara</surname></persName> watched the conflict from the battery, and scarcely did more than breathe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>She shed no tear, but the deep melancholy of her eyes and the shuddering which shook her frame, when <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00551" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s cannon were belching forth their venom, showed the agony of her heart, and when repeated messages came assuring friends that their loved ones were safe, she yet teared to fill the bright angel hope to her <unclear>heart,</unclear> but when she could really no longer doubt the mouth of the blessed tidings, the reaction, after the great excitement she had undergone, seemed to have turned her to a marble statue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/> I was with <persName n="Clara,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00552" reg="mostcommon:Clara,nomatch:0"><surname>Clara</surname></persName> again on the happy day on which the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag was hoisted on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and when that emblem of a nation's triumph over the hand of tyranny was unfurled and fluttered out upon the breeze of heaven, I felt her tremble as she leaned on me for support, and I could not help congratulating her that for the present, at least, her heart could now revel in his happiness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/> Ah, it was a proud moment for every Southern heart to see that banner which for so long had been taunting us to our very faces and a canker to our happiness, now lowered before the emblem of justice and right, and our State flag with its palmetto and crescent shedding out their pure advert light, from its ground of Heaven's own azure hue, waving upon the seagirl for tress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>Ah! our very souls thrilled with pure patriotism, and from many a heart went up a fervent thank to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who, by a miraculous interposition, had saved us from the power of the enemy and given us the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Oh, surely we should be a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-serving, <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-fearing people, <q>&#x0022;for His merciful kindness is indeed great toward us.&#x0022;</q> </p>
