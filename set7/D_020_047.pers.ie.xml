<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> On the <date value="07-04">4th day of July</date> last, a Convention of Cotton Planters was held in the city of <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The States of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> were pretty well represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>As the <rs>President</rs> of that Convention, I adopt this method of presenting to the public the claims of the enterprise in which it is engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The representation being confined to a few States, it was not deemed advisable, nor indeed did we feel that we were authorized by se small a delegation to undertake a great deal, but from such a stand point we were able to survey the vastness of the field before us, and to appreciate something of the benefits which might result to the cause of our country, from an assemblage of wise and experienced men, brought into conference from every portion of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> We could not, at any rate, consent to abandon an enterprise which had been so wisely conceived, and which, to our minds, seemed capable of accomplishing so much good, merely because, in its inception, it had not met with universal favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It was determined, therefore, to meet again in the city of <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Georgia</placeName>, on the <date value="10-15">15th day of October</date> next, and in the meantime, by presenting the subject to the public, to endeavor to enlist in the movement the great body of the planters of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> I come now to ask of this class who hold in their hands the vast productive wealth of the <rs>South</rs>, a due consideration of this question, and a full representation in the next Convention from every State in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>I know that the history of popular conventions may discredit their efficiency for usefulness; the want of earnest co-operation, and their subserviency to personal schemes, too often converting their deliberations into farces, and their actions ending in fruitless resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Yet, after all, they afford the most practicable mode of ascertaining and consolidating the opinions of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> In this Convention there will be no individual schemes to foster, no ulterior designs to accomplish; but an honest, undivided effort to provide the ways and means of supporting the <rs>Government</rs> in its present extra ordinary emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It may, if the people wish it, be a Mass Convention, I would that it could be, and I therefore invite all who can do so, to meet with us. But the questions to be considered will be grave, deep, broad; involving on the <num value="1">one</num> hand the wants of the <rs>Government</rs>, and on the other, the wisest mode of applying to those wants the material aid within the control of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Impulse and enthusiasm are good in their place, but they must be directed in wisdom in planning, and sustained by uncompromising purpose in executing the schemes which may be devised. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>To this end, we hope to see a chosen delegation from each <orgName n="Congressional District" type="district">Congressional District</orgName>, as well as from each State at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Let the delegates be men who have the confidence of their constituency, as well as the ability to devise a plan of aid to the <rs>Government</rs>, that will be acceptable and adopted, and let them come up prepared to make the largest pledges of support and recommend the best plans of making our means available. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> We do not propose any assumption of powers which shall conflict in the least with the constituted authorities of the country, nor shall we arrogate to ourselves wisdom equal to theirs, in managing the great interests committed to their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> and Congress have no assurance of the unanimity with which the people, all over the <name>States</name>, are prepared to sustain and co-operate with them, yet, in the multitude of counsel there is safety, and in a large and intelligent assemblage, representing and voluntarily emanating from the agricultural interests of the land, there will be found much to encourage the hearts and string then the hands of those who are directly charged with the administration of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> After the <date value="09-01">1st of September,</date> the following will be the rates of publication of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch:</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Daily Paper</hi>--<hi rend="italics"><measure n="2cents" type="currency">Two cents</measure></hi> per copy at the counter and from the regular carriers of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> Neither the <name>Semi</name>-Weekly nor Weekly paper will be sent for a less term than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> This advance in the rates of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> is made only because it is unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Every item of expenditure in the production of the paper has been increased, and there are several new items of disbursement incident to the war amounting to a large sum. Paper is advanced from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="12cents" type="currency">twelve cents</measure> per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Printing ink is higher; in short, everything used in our business is appreciated by the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Ordinarily, the advertising custom is the main reliance of a paper gotten up on the plan of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch:</hi> the paper by itself not being relied upon for compensation for the outlay of money and labor in its publication. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> We are sure the reader will appreciate the reasons inducing this step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>We were reluctant to yield to them, and therefore have postponed an announcement which, in justice to ourselves, should have been made at an earlier day. The public cannot expect that we should furnish a paper at a cost below the outlay of printing it. No effort and no expense has been avoided that could, at this momentous period, increase its general interest and value as a news-paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>We feel the consolation in making this unavoidable increase in the price of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> that it is worth it, and we have the vanity to think that our readers will concur in this opinion. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Sick and wounded soldiers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> We have often referred to the well ascertained fact that, even under the most perfect military organization, the losses from disease are greater than those from battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Of course, when such organizations are new, and composed of volunteer forces, hastily formed to meet a sudden and unexpected emergency, the losses must be much greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We have little doubt that the losses of both the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern armies from this source have been already greater than they have already suffered, or will hereafter suffer, for a year hence in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It becomes a matter of supreme importance to provide for the health of the well, the restoration of the sick, and the healing of the wounded, not only in the general and obvious means for the purpose which suggest themselves even to uninstructed observers, but in all those details which are recommended by the large experience of the world in warfare, which are perfectly familiar to regularly educated military men, and which, even to those who are not so, are easily accessible in the innumerable reports, pamphlets and books, which have been issued upon this harvest of military service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> Ambulances for the conveyance of sick and wounded men have become essential accompaniments of every <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>To say that the <rs>South</rs> is deplorably destitute of appliances of this character, is to bring no reproach against the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, for the <rs>North</rs> has long adroitly monopolized every species of manufactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>But we have now entered on a career of self- dependence, and the blockade has taught us that we can produce many articles, both of war and peace, for which we had depended in former times entirely upon the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Preparations, we are happy to learn, are now making to provide the <rs>Southern Army</rs> with ambulances, but this of course must be a work of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>In the interval, there must be great suffering among the sick and wounded, especially in sections like the <rs>Northwest</rs>, where there are no means of transporting soldiers either by steam or water, and where, we learn, sick soldiers are conveyed in wagons without springs, from <placeName reg="Monterey, Highland, Virginia" key="tgn,2113061">Monterey</placeName> to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, a distance of <measure n="46miles" type="distance">forty-six miles</measure>! Such a journey, even to a man in vigorous health, jolted over bad roads, would be a most trying operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>What must be its effect upon a poor, suffering, sick and wounded man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We are not surprised to hear that it often becomes necessary to remove the wretched invalids from these wagons without springs, which are only instruments of torture, to dwellings near the road, where some of them terminate their miserable journey and the journey of life together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> We mention these facts not to attribute blame to any <num value="1">one</num>, for we believe we have not an ambulance in the <rs>Southern</rs> army, but to suggest that some substitute might be provided, till such time as a sufficient number of ambulances can be procured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>There are plenty of wagons with springs which might be employed for the conveyance of the sick and wounded, wagons which would be readily volunteered by their owners, if the occasion required it, or which, if necessary, might be pressed into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If the <name>Governments</name> and <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, supply without stint ambulances for the transportation of the sick and wounded among their mercenary soldiers, nearly all of whom are taken from the dregs of society, and who probably have a more comfortable life in the camp than they were ever able to obtain in industrial pursuits, can we ever be attentive enough for the relief of the sick and wounded soldiers of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, most of whom are accustomed to homes of case and even luxury, and all inspired by the noblest and most disinterested patriotism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We commend to the authorities having this department in charge that spring wagons ought at once to be substituted for those horrible mediums which are how employed in some sections for the conveyance of weak and wounded men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> We have referred before to the importance of quartering new regiments who arrive here during had weather, heated by the exercise of a long march, in dry and comfortable quarters, instead of damp, wet places, when the sudden transition from heat to cold will have a more destructive effect upon a regiment than the fire of a whole battery of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Scarcely less important is it, that the cooking should be done by competent hands, and, for this purpose, each mass ought to be furnished with a servant, who has, or, like his class in general, can readily attain a practical knowledge of cooking while, it is quite impossible, any length of practice can ever give a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The cooks in hospitals must, of course, be the best that can be obtained anywhere, for it is obvious that none but skillful and experienced cooks should ever be attached to an hospital, and that there should be enough of them.--Where cookery is uniform as in a hotel, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> cooks, with a sufficient number of scallions, may be enough for <num value="500">five hundred</num> people; but in a hospital, which the physicians prescribed a list for sick man <unclear></unclear> his </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> medicine, there ought to be <num value="1">one</num> cook to every <num value="100">hundred</num> persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Another important suggestion, which we commend to the immediate attention of the authorities, is that convalescent patients be at once removed from the hospitals to private residences, whose doors would be everywhere cheerfully open to them, if it could only be known that they were in a condition to be thus received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>As soon as patients become convalescent, they should be at once removed from the gloomy and depressing scenes and associations of the hospital, and placed where cheerful surroundings and kind attentions could facilitate their restoration to health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>We have already published a general invitation to the convalescent soldiers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, from the patriotic and hospitable ladies of <placeName reg="Rockbridge, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002186">Rockbridge county</placeName>, who offer and desire to make their houses the homes of the suffering heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>And we believe that we speak without exaggeration when we emphatically declare that there is not a family in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> which would not gladly, and even gratefully, throw open its doors to convalescent soldiers from the hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> would feel that such a deed was conferring a favor upon them far more than upon the guest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We have never heard or read of such a spirit as now actuates the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and of the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>No man considers his property or his life his own. All belongs to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Now, it remains for the authorities to give appropriate and adequate organization and efficiency to this magnificent spirit of disinterested and self-sacrificing patriotism. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> The apparently wavering, shilly-shally course of the <rs>British Administration</rs> has never for a moment modified our unalterable conviction that, if the <rs>Southern Government</rs> bars up all outlets of escape for cotton, except in the way it has prescribed, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will be compelled to take active measures to break the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> The monotony of our camp was somewhat relieved yesterday by the arrival of the cars at this station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>At least a regiment of our brigade was on the ground to witness the <q>&#x0022;grand entrance.&#x0022;</q> With what gratification we witnessed this evidence that the <q> &#x0022;outside world&#x0022;</q> was still in motion, is better felt than described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>In fact, the railroad is now an institution, and we long for its arrival each day, and hundreds greet its arrival with pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>For several reasons we are glad to see the cars here &mdash; it is a novelty in our camp; it affords better transportation for supplies, and we are enabled to have better communication with the <q>&#x0022;dear ones at home,&#x0022;</q> besides receiving the papers.
