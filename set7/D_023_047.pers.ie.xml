<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> As our troops approached the railroad bridge over the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, the enemy commenced shelling it with great fray, and finally succeeded in burning the structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>While the fight at <placeName reg="Berkeley's Ford">Berkeley's Ford</placeName> was in progress, and after it had terminated, heavy firing was heard on the left, or in the direction of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, supposed to proceed from some portion of our forces that had crossed higher up the stream. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was further stated that our cavalry had burned a bridge over <placeName key="tgn,2229381" n="1.000 504" reg="cedar mountain, culpeper, virginia">Cedar Run</placeName>, on the <rs type="place">Orange and Alexandria Road</rs>, between <placeName reg="Warrenton Junction">Warrenton Junction</placeName> and <persName><roleName n="Prince">the Prince</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName> line, cutting off the retreat of the enemy in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and that a large body of our infantry and artillery had moved down from <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> and taken position between the enemy and the point at which this bridge was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This statement, though not improbable, is not scarcely worthy to be considered as positively correct. </p>

<head>The coming <rs type="season">Autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">Winter</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> An officer who came down in the same train with the prisoners last <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and who conversed freely with them and with those taken at <placeName reg="Slaughter Mountain, Rappahannock, Virginia" key="tgn,2668881">Cedar Run</placeName>, says they very generally expressed this or opinion with regard to the war: They did not expect to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>, but they were determined to ruin the country and to compel the inhabitants, by the strong argument of absolute starvation, to return to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>This they meant to do by continual incursions &mdash; by the destruction of houses &mdash; by the ruin of crops &mdash; by the deportation of negroes &mdash; by the plunder of cattle, horses, hogs, and every living thing on the plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>That this is the system determined upon by higher powers than these soldiers, we do not doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The whole country on both sides of the <rs>James</rs>, the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and the <rs>Potomac</rs>, as far up as <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named river, and as the mountains on the others, has been reduced to a desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>A man may travel for miles in any direction without meeting or overtaking a human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The houses along the road are as silent as death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The inhabitants have fled; the enclosures are all broken down; the windows and doors are staved in; the very <q>&#x0022;abomination of desolation&#x0022;</q> sits brooding in silence over the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Such are the fruits of the <q>&#x0022;defensive policy&#x0022;</q>--so called, we presume, because it defends nothing as a grove was called (in Latin) <hi rend="italics"><q>&#x0022;incus, &#x0022;</q></hi> because the light could not penetrate it. Such, we say, are the fruits of this policy, which it would be an abuse of enology to call <q>&#x0022;infernal.&#x0022;</q> We have a long line of frontier on the land, which it is impossible to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>We have a still longer seaboard, with scarcely a vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Our enemy has men enough on land and several <num value="100">hundred</num> vessels afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Under these circumstances, we have been called upon to stand by the defensive policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> From all indications this policy is to be persisted in. Under the stimulus of overwhelming terror our Congress passed a Conscription law, and it saved the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>They then dispersed to parts unknown, and left the country to take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The immediate danger is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>They have re-assembled, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effort of the session is directed to the undoing of all that the <name>Conscription</name> has done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> tells us, in substance, that we do not want any more men; <persName n="Foote,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName> introduces a bill to upset the <name>Conscription</name> law, and the members are spending the precious time that should be spent in preparing to meet the emergency which is most assuredly approaching, in idle talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>We only hope they may not find out, in the next <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>; that they have <q>&#x0022;no more business before them,&#x0022;</q> and <q> &#x0022;skedaddle,&#x0022;</q> as they did last spring, leaving the capital of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in danger a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time from an irruption of the <rs>Northern</rs> barbarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>History is repeating itself after an interval of only a single year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We are about to re-enact the scenes of the post-Manassas era. <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is rapidly raising his <num value="600000">600,000</num> men, besides building a fleet of Merrimacs and Monitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We are laughing at him as we were last year, and indulging ourselves in the delusion that the men will not be forthcoming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>In <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> the frost will be here, and upon the back of it, nothing is more probable than that we shall have the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>To suppose, after the experience of last year, that the <num value="600000">600,000</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will not be forthcoming, is to indulge in a dream, which it were gross flattery to the dreamer to stigmatize as hallucination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It is something even beyond infatuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>It is absolute, unalloyed, palpable idiocy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>If those who indulge in it had alone to suffer we should not feel disposed to arouse them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>We should be rather pleased than otherwise to see them pay the penalty of their folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>But, unfortunately, it is as true now as it has ever been, that when rulers turn fools the <hi rend="italics">people</hi> suffer for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> It is true we have no need of more men to day, and may not have to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>But will any man undertake to say what we may want a month hence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The Northern papers teem with accounts of the successful progress of the system instituted for raising men. New regiments are pouring into <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The draft is prosecuted throughout Yankeedom with unsparing vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Our soil is still occupied by the destroying host of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Are we never to make an effort to transfer the war to the territories of the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Is this <q>&#x0022;defensive war&#x0022;</q> to be persevered in until not <num value="1">one</num> blade of grass be left in the whole country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>If we expect ever to end it, we must invade the enemy's country, and make him feel the evils he is inflicting on us. At present he feels comparatively little of its pressure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>He is snug at home, and sends out his marauders to plunder us. If he be beaten, he has only to retire for a while until he can recruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>He need not fear for his own home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>He has nothing to think of but how he shall best annoy us. We had hoped that, after our late great successes, we should have put an end to this system by invading the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>But it seems our hopes are vain.--We are to have no more men for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The wretched system of feeding the war by piece-meal is to be kept up. Our rulers will never learn that half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men now are better than a <num value="1000000">million</num> a year from this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It is disheartening, but there is no help for it. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Death under all circumstances is saddening, but was peculiarly so in this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>While in his youthful days he embraced the <rs>Christian</rs> religion, and always walked worthy the vocation to which he was called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>A bright example to all who knew him, his many virtues will ever live in the remembrance of his compatriots and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>When the Old Dominion <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> threw off the shackles of tyranny, he, with many of his profession, gave up his all and patriotically proceeded to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and there proudly offered his services, his property, and if needs be, his life to the <rs>Governor</rs> of his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Some <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> ago he was called on to perform <num value="1">one</num> of the most responsible and dangerous duties that is in the power of man to conceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>How gallantly and how bravely did he respond to his country's call, future history will answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>But it is enough to say, while in the discharge of his duty as pilot of the <rs>Virginia</rs>, how bravely and successfully did he act his part while guiding her, not only through the dangers of the waters and shoals, but through a storm of powder and ball, never wavering, but always mindful of his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>At the time of the destruction of that once proud and victorious ship be, with other true patriots, left their wives and children and marched to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to again enlist under their country's flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>But, alas' too soon did he learn, like her, his occupation was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Who can but drop a tear of grief to think of him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Away from his beloved wife and children, and they entirely dependent and at the mercy of our insolent foe, with no husband or father to comfort or protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Although he breathed his last away from home, with no wife to bathe his burning brow &mdash; no children to kiss his fevered lips and lisp a last farewell &mdash; it is a solace to them to know be had many friends who watched over and administered to all his wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>As <num value="1">one</num> of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and many friends, who knew him well and admired his many excellent qualities of head and heart, the writer of this imperfect sketch would beg leave to add a word of praise to the memory of a gallant friend and gentleman.
