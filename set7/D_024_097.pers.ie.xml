<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Whilst iron clad ships may be useful for harbor defence, it is clear that they are not, even upon smooth water, invulnerable, whilst at sea the slightest gale would send them to the water.

<head>The Difference.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The modest and rational spirit exhibited by the people of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and the whole <rs>South</rs> in regard to the triumphant repulse of the iron-clad monsters is in striking contrast with the frantic intoxication manifested by the <rs>North</rs> over every success of their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Here was a naval and land expedition of the most formidable character, a fleet of iron clad monsters which had cost <num value="1000000">millions</num> upon <num value="1000000">millions</num> of money, and which had been prepared with all the resources in mechanical skill, inspired by all the vengeance and vindictiveness of the <rs>North</rs>, put completely <hi rend="italics">hors du combat</hi> in a fight of a few hours!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> was saved, the question of iron-clad ships and forts properly defended settled forever, and the pride and power of the <rs>North</rs> thoroughly humbled upon its favorite element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>And yet, after an achievement which might well have justified the wildest joy and enthusiasm, the whole Southern people exhibit a calmness and equanimity which few nations but our own, and least of all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, are capable of. If New York had successfully defended itself against such a fleet as that which assailed <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, the whole city, and every other Northern city, would have been Illuminated, the bells rung, cannon fired, and the entire population given itself up to every possible extravagance of triumph and delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>And thus it has been since the war commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>From the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs> to the present hour, the long array of unparalleled victories which the <rs>South</rs> has achieved has never called forth any wild demonstration of popular joy, but has been received with deep and silent gratitude to Heaven, and with a moderation and self- possession which none but a people truly great could exhibit. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
