<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>We have not space for even a brief outline of the speech, which, from beginning to ending, was marked by true eloquence and patriotic devotion, and received by his hearers with manifestations of favor and applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The several subjects which now interest and agitate the public mind were discussed with rare ability and with an earnestness that attested the speaker's sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The currency was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> subject referred to, which, in the opinion of the speaker, was not beyond the reach of remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Its inflation was attributable to <num value="3">three</num> causes: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, a scarcity of many of the commodities upon which we are compelled to rely; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, a redundancy of Confederate money; and <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, a decline in the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The measures adopted by the last Congress would, in the judgment of the speaker, when once in effective operation, have a tendency to reduce the volume of the currency and re-establish, to some extent, the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>.--But our success in this struggle was not dependent upon our finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>A persistent perseverance in the war would end in the achievement of our ultimate independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It was not desirable that peace should come now. Peace too early might not be lasting or honorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We could not expect the <rs>North</rs> to grant an honorable peace at the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>By persevering in the war we would eventually compel the reluctant <rs>North</rs> to acknowledge our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>We had nothing to expect from foreign intervention or from the peace party of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Foreign intervention would only come when foreign interests required it; and the peace party of the <rs>North</rs> was a barometer of battles, which rose with <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> and fell with <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.
