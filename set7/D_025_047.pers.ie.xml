<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> It has now become a question whether the enemy has not determined on a change of tactics, abandoned the &#x0022;on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022; idea, and is not preparing to transfer the seat of war for the present to the <orgName n="West and South" type="newspaper">West and South</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The frequent attempts against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> have ended in disastrous failures, and the strange inactivity of <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>, accountable on no other hypothesis than the weakness and disaffection of his army since the <rs>Pennsylvania</rs> campaign, proves that he has no reasonable ground of hoping to accomplish what men able as himself, and backed by powerful and as well equipped armies, have failed to achieve before him. Northern journals inform us that he has detached troops &mdash; in some instances regiments of them &mdash; to proceed to certain points in the <rs>North</rs> for the purpose of bringing on conscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A little reflection is sufficient to perceive that this is merely a subterfuge, as such a force, especially in the critical situation of the army, is unnecessary for such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The object undoubtedly is to use these ostensible conscript guards to overawe the people at home, and to suppress the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> manifestation of another popular uprising against the enforcement of the draft and other obnoxious measures of the <rs>Government</rs>, monitions of which have already been given in New York and other cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The asseverations of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers to the contrary, <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> is too weak for offensive operations on the scale requisite for the overthrow of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName> and the taking of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; and the practical results of the draft thus far show that it will end in the replenishing of the treasury by <num value="1000000">millions</num> of &#x0022;greenbacks,&#x0022; but the securing of few recruits for this army, and the majority of these unreliable, and of the worst material in the districts of the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The evidence is in favor of the belief that the main strength and efforts of the enemy will be concentrated and directed against our strongholds in the <name>South</name> and <name>West</name>, and then to give the &#x0022;rebellion&#x0022; the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">coup de grace</hi> </foreign> by a united blow against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This done, and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> split again, the rebellion is virtually crushed, as they will believe, and the <rs n="Fall of Richmond" type="battle">fall of Richmond</rs> only a question of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It was in all respects perfect.--When he came to consciousness the man was told that until his substitute was procured he was considered a conscript.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>He was exceedingly surprised that his deception was unmasked. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Another man followed him, who wished to be a substitute, upon whose limbs were big nodules, like spavins upon a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>He was an Irishman.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> After an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of such firing as I have described, we could see, from where we stood, the enemy moving up in <num value="3">three</num> lines from out of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>They would come out, marching by flank, till they reached the desired ground, when they would face to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line was about a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in the rear of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and on the edge of the woods, across the valley, was <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>It was a splendid sight to see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>No <num value="1">one</num> looked at their uniforms or no uniforms, their hats, or caps, or bare heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Everybody looked at the beautiful way in which they arrayed themselves in order of attack, regardless of the shot and shell which we threw into their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The soldiers on our side again and again praised, while they awaited the approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Nor did they wait long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>When they approached to within about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>, a part of our division, I think it was <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, opened fire, and we could see men fall and others go to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Still on they came, crowding a little in front, but as steady as rocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Just then an officer rode by and said the <rs>Vermont</rs> regiment on the left was worrying the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>But they did not mind that either; on they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>When they got within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, more of our regiments opened fire; but it did not stop them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Some regiments reserved their fire till they got within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure>, and then the enemy fell fast; but still on they came, and we could see their faces and hear their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>It was almost too much for human nature to stand; and a portion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">second brigade</orgName>, which was behind the stone fence, began to leave cover &mdash; not because the enemy was upon it, but because it seemed impossible to stay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The flags of the enemy, which are small red affairs, with a white cross diagonal on them, got up to the stone wall, and some crossed the line of rail fence, perhaps a <num value="100">hundred</num> or so, led, as I heard, by <persName n="Armistead,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Armistead,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Armistead</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>They were able to do this because, as I have told you, the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">second brigade</orgName> did not stand up to the line of the stone wall and rail fence, so that the division was bent backward in the centre, as it were, the ends on the right and left standing fast; at least so it seemed, for there was a great deal of smoke and a terrific noise to confuse <num value="1">one</num>'s power of calm observation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>At this time the enemy were crowding over the stone fence near the clumps of trees, and their red flags were waving, as it seemed to me, in triumph already, though <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName> was all right and his men were steady on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Presently some <num value="1">one</num> near me said that the enemy were massing their men in front of <persName n="Webb,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Webb,nomatch:0"><surname>Webb</surname></persName>, opposite the clumps of trees, and we began to wish for <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>'s help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>By this time the officers had stopped the falling back, and were driving stragglers to the front, though we did not go forward to the stone wall, yet, but all were facing the enemy and firing heavily &mdash; not in ranks, for every <num value="1">one</num> seemed going it pretty much on his own hook; but cheerfully, which was a good sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>We had wished for <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>, so he came as wished, and his right marched by the flank to our left and got mixed with our men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> As the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Brigade">3d brigade</orgName> (<persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>'s) came up by the flank there was a disposition, under the heavy fire to which it was exposed, to edge away from the stone wall, but the officers overcame this, and soon a compact body of men was formed, who delivered a heavy and well-directed fire upon the enemy as they came over the wall and rail fence towards us. Just then an officer, I think it was the same who had gone for <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gibbon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Gibbon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gibbon</surname></persName>'s aid, came over with some regiments from the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">1st brigade</orgName> (<persName n="Harrow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Harrow,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrow</surname></persName>'s) on our left, and from him it was reported that the extreme right of the enemy, which was opposite <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>, was breaking badly, and that men were running to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>This greatly encouraged us, and we cheered and went to our work with a will.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> The throwing of a few shells into the city by way of showing what he could do availed the <rs>Federal General</rs> nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It was a barbarous act, utterly unjustifiable under the usages of civilized war. It endangered the lives of a few women and children, but had no effect upon the stern determination of our commander and his troops save to make them, if possible, the more determined to resist the enemy to the bitter end. It is reported that the <rs>French</rs> and Spanish Consuls protested against the bombardment of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> upon such brief notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The Federal <rs type="role2">Commander</rs>, however, repeated his threat to commence the bombardment of the city yesterday at <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>They have, moreover, declared that the spirit manifested by the <rs>South</rs> in the field of battle, and the profound and deadly hostility of its whole people to the <rs>North</rs>, forbade the idea of reconstruction, reconciliation, or anything else but war to the bitter end.--To suppose that <name>English</name> public sentiment has been completely revolutionized on these points by the events of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> is to attribute to it a versatility and shallowness not characteristic of the <rs>English</rs> people, and which would strip their opinions of all weight and value. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>But the foreign world ought by this time to know the precise amount of credit to attach to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> statements.--Journals in the <rs>Exeter Hall</rs> interest may predict a speedy termination of &#x0022;the rebellion;&#x0022; but we venture to assert that the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> and other acknowledged organs of <name>English</name> public opinion, have not so stultified themselves.
