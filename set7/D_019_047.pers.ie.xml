<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> I appear before you only for a very few, brief remarks in response to what has been said to me. I thank you most sincerely for this reception and the generous words in which support has been promised me upon this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>I thank your great Commonwealth for the overwhelming support it recently gave, not me personally, but the cause which I think a just <num value="1">one</num>, in the late election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>(Loud applause.) Allusion has been made to the fact &mdash; the interesting fact, perhaps we should say-- that I for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time appear at the capital of the great Commonwealth of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> upon the birthday of the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country, in connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the history of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>I have already gone through <num value="1">one</num> exceedingly interesting scene this morning in the ceremonies at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Under the high conduct of gentlemen there I was for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time allowed the privilege of standing in old <placeName reg="Independence Hall">Independence Hall</placeName>, (enthusiastic cheering,) to have a few words addressed to me there, and opening to me an opportunity of expressing with much regret that I had not more time to express something of my own feelings, excited by the occasion, somewhat to harmonize and give shape to the feelings that had been really the feeling of my whole life.-- Besides this, our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>They had arranged it so that I was given the honor of raising it to the head of its staff, (applause,) and when it went up I was pleased that it went to its place by the strength of my own feeble arm. When, according to the arrangement, the cord was pulled, and it flaunted gloriously to the wind without an accident, in the light glowing sunshine of the morning, I could not help hoping that there was in the entire success of that beautiful ceremony, at least something of an omen of what is to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>(Loud applause.) Nor could I help feeling then, as I often have felt, in the whole of that proceeding I was a very humble instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>I had not provided the flag; I had not made the arrangements for elevating it to its place; I had applied but a very small portion of my feeble strength in raising it. In the whole transaction I was in the hands of the people who had arranged it, and if I can have the <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> same generous co-operation of the people of the nation, I think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting gloriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>(Loud, enthusiastic and continued cheering.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> I recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in regard to what has been said about the military support which the <rs>General Government</rs> may expect from the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> in a proper emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>To guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It is not with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a necessity may arise in this country for the use of the military arm (Applause.) While I am exceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your military force here, and exceedingly gratified at your promise here to use that force upon a proper emergency; while I make these acknowledgments I desire to repeat, in order to preclude any possible misconstruction, that I do most sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them, (applause;) that it will never become their duty to shed blood &mdash; most especially never to shed fraternal blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>I promise that so far as I may have wisdom to direct, if so painful a result shall in any wise be brought about, it shall be through no fault of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>(Cheers.) --Allusion has also been made by <num value="1">one</num> of your honored speakers to some remarks recently made by myself at <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburg</placeName>, in regard to what is supposed to be the especial interests of this great Commonwealth of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>I now wish only to say, in regard to that matter, that the few remarks which I uttered on that occasion were rather carefully worded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>I took pains that they should be so. I have seen no occasion since to add to them or subtract from them; I leave them precisely as they stand--(applause)-- adding only now that I am pleased to have no expression from you, gentlemen of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, significant that they are unsatisfactory to you. And now, gentlemen of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, allow me to return you again my most sincere thanks. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>It is an attempt to subvert the <rs>Constitution</rs> by an act of Congress, and to create the incoming <rs>President</rs> a military dictator. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/> The Constitution, as a <orgName n="New York Journal" type="newspaper">New York journal</orgName> observes in an article on this subject, gives the <rs>President</rs> power to call out and to use the militia for the suppression of insurrection in any State, or on the call of the <rs>Governor</rs> if the <name>Legislature</name> should not be in session, and the reason of the provision is assigned &mdash; namely, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> guarantees to every State a <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> form of government, and the <rs>Federal</rs> power is bound to interpose when legally called upon by the authorities of the <rs>State</rs>, to prevent its overthrow by physical violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>There is only <num value="1">one</num> other case where the <rs>President</rs> has any constitutional authority to use the militia, and that is in repelling invasion in the event of foreign war. But this new Force Bill, in the face of the article of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which limits the powers of the <rs>President</rs> by declaring that what is not expressly granted is reserved to the <name>States</name> and to the people respectively, authorizes the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> to call the whole power of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy, together with the militia, and volunteers in any numbers, to invade a State and subjugate it, under the pretext of &#x0022;enforcing the laws of the <rs>Union</rs>,&#x0022; not merely without the invitation of the <name>Legislature</name> or <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of such State, but in express opposition to their authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> The new bill gives him authority not merely to enforce the laws in aid of the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> and the civil power in a State, but to employ the whole military power to enforce any order he or his agents may choose to issue, however arbitrary and despotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>A postmaster, for example, could embroil the whole country in civil war in pursuance of this bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>And, furthermore, to cap the climax of the tyranny, all the military force of the land is to be put under the articles of war, and should any member of the militia make any harsh comment on the measures of Congress or the proceedings of the <rs>President</rs>, (&#x0022;speak disrespectfully of them, &#x0022;) he is liable to the tender mercies of a court-martial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>What more, we should like to know, is necessary to the completion of a military despotism? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>An army and a navy of invasion, and a Military Despotism, are thus impending over the head of the <rs>South</rs>.
