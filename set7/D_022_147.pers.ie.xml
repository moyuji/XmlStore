<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>whoever he may be, and hope that he will again remember us in a similar manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We hear that nearly every day Northern papers are obtained by some of the regiments along the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and that they are often thrown about the camp and finally destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Our army friends could not confer a greater favor upon this office than by sending us such late papers as they may receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Even old papers are oftentimes of values for they may contain items of great interest to some of our many readers. </p> </div3>

<head>The lines, &#x0026;c.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The city was tormented by various rumors yesterday in regard to the movements and proceedings of our army, but, as usual, none of them was found to have the least foundation in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Some said that not less than <num value="2">two</num>, others not less than <num value="3">three</num>, whole regiments had been cut off by the enemy during <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>; that we has captured at least <measure n="300" type="prisoners">300 prisoners</measure>, <measure n="1000" type="killed">killed 1,000</measure> or more, and that a general action would ensue yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>All these foolish reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>it is unnecessary to say, were grossly false, and that nothing had transpired at our Lines to warrant their circulation or belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is true, that on <name>Wednesday</name> warm skirmishing had progressed throughout the day to the right of the <orgName n="York River Railroad" type="railroad">York River Railroad</orgName>, in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were much worsted, leaving many killed and wounded to our care; a few prisoners, also, were brought in, who gave vainable information, but more than this nothing occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>From dispositions made along the front on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, and from preparations going on yesterday, everything seemed to indicate that an engagement would ensue during the day; but, although the troops were marched and countermarched, the enemy's cannon booming from time to time and skirmishing was constant, the men stacked arms, and reposed quietly in the shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Several of our field surgeons were busy in attending to the poor unfortunate wounded who fell to our care on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and the character of their wounds was most shocking, our men having taken deadly aim, and put an effectual barrier to all attentions of the medical staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Several wounded <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers died before any attention could be paid to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>From prisoners we learn that the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> regiments opposed to ours on Wednesday were considered the best troops under <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, and in marching to the front anticipated naught else but <q>&#x0022;sport.&#x0022;</q> thinking our men would immediately give ground before them; but, after a few hours of skirmishing, they learned to look upon the rebels with a different eye, and could not be prevailed upon to advance on our line, although entreated and almost forced to do so. Many of their killed and wounded were carried off as soon as they fell, so that an estimate of their loss is impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is considered to be not less than <num value="300">three hundred</num>, from prisoners statements, while ours does not exceed <num value="50">fifty</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> We are glad to see that our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have made every provision for any forthcoming battle, and among other regulations have detailed a per centum of every regiment to look after and attend to the wounded, thus preventing any combatant having an excuse for leaving the ranks again, on the plea of attending to the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>At the battle of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, though few comparatively left their regiments or companies under any pretext, yet there were many more than necessity warranted-- many stretcher-bearers having little or nothing to do, while stout, stalwart men, (in some few instances, be it said.) were observed leading off men whose wounds were not of any serious character <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s orders to the army were read yesterday and heartily approved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>All the men seem to desire is action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Prisoners say <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is busily engaged in entrenching his swamp; it remains, therefore, for our wise leaders to say how long this shall continue, and how long our army may be kept pity engendering sickness and silents of a pernicious character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Several batches of prisoners from <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s command have arrived in our city within the past few days having been sent either since sickness or debility prevented their making the trip to <placeName reg="Salisbury, Rowan, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076487">Salisbury, N. C.</placeName>, with numerous companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They all speak in unmeasured terms of their repeated defeats in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> at <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s hands, and seem to think experience has taught them the folly of pretending to cops or withstand so daring and dashing a leader as <q>&#x0022;Old Stonewall.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They started forward, skirmishers being thrown out by the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="3SCRegiment">3d South Carolina regiments</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They had gone but a short distance into the woods when a brisk fire commenced along the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Upon our steady advance the enemy was driven back, and our men then pressed forward and took possession of their camps bringing off overcoats, rubber-cloths, and several fine <name type="weapon">Enfield rifles</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>After pressing the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> back upon their main body, a fire was opened upon them with artillery, and our skirmishers were ordered to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Some <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> of the <name>South Carolinas</name> were wounded, among them <persName n="Cuthbert,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Cuthbert,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Cuthbert</surname></persName>, of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, severely in the arm, and <persName n="Walker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Walker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, severely in the shoulder.

<head>The substitute Swindle.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> For sometime past persons representing themselves either as Baltimoreans or members of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1VARegiment">1st Virginia regiment</orgName>, have been through the army trying to sell themselves as substitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In several cases these swindlers have succeeded in accomplishing their object, and have received money from their too willing dupes, deserting as soon as it was safely in their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We doubt if <num value="1">one</num> of these men ever belonged to the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">First Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We doubt if they are anything but the veriest scoundrels and knaves &mdash; men who have deserted time and time again, and who make a business of this nefarious practices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>These men also have accomplices in this city in those who advertise so extensively to furnish substitutes <q>&#x0022;at a reasonable price, &#x0022;</q> who not only assist them in their swindling tricks, but swear to their character and shelter them in their low dens when they have deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>After a short time they are again brought out and sold over to other parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Within a day or <num value="2">two</num> we have heard of at least a down of these rascals who have been offered at different points in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><num value="2">Two</num> came to an Alabama regiment, and were purchased for <measure n="1700dollars" type="currency">$1,700</measure>, <num value="600">six hundred</num> of this going to the man who procured them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> afterwards both men were missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This evil has become so great that it should be immediately attended to, and some of the base follows summarily dealt with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> ways to put an end to the pernicious practice, In the first place, every man who offers to sell himself as a substitute should be looked upon with suspicion, and be arrested on the spot as a deserter, which in <measure n="9cases" type="mass">nine cases</measure> out of <num value="10">ten</num> he will prove to be. Secondly, a few of them should be court-martialed and formally shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>After what has transpired, and the frequent warning given by the press, it would be the height of folly for any soldier to throw his money away upon these infamous scoundrels. </p> </div3>
