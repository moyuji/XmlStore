<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It has been beaten, routed, driven like chaff before the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Let us, then hear no whining, no whimpering, no excuses for cowardice, on the plea of being overwhelmed by numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>That has always been the apology for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> defeat heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Let it no longer be made, since here is a <hi rend="italics">boast</hi> that they outnumber us <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Marvels, they have performed; miracles, if you will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>But impossibilities!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>they are a horse of a different color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>They have beaten, although their full strength was not there, the combined forces of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, and <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.--They have given these veracious gentry food enough for a whole broadside of bulletins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>They have furnished them with material to manufacture <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> victories out of for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Having lost <num value="80">eighty</num> cannon and <measure n="10000" type="prisoners">10,000 prisoners</measure>, as if is said they have, doubtless they will announce themselves as having gained the most glorious victory ever accorded to leaders on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>We await their bulletins with the liveliest curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> was right when it said that if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> should really gain a victory, the people of their cities would be sure, if they told the tale themselves, to go in mourning for it. A victory by <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> or <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> always means a disastrous defeat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> Nothing can equal or abate <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> impudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It is as indestructible as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> propensity to lie. Mark how the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> talks about marching over the <q>&#x0022;rebels,&#x0022;</q> and marching into <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.--<num value="1">One</num> would hardly think that these are the same <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who were flying before our troops like a flock of sheep, a few weeks ago, on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Precisely the same kind of language was used when <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> set out with his grand army, <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> ago. We were to be run over by the invincible <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> heroes as though we were so many insensible objects, incapable of raising a hand in our own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Anybody but a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, remembering the vaporings of that period, and the end of them all, would be ashamed to repeat them after the lapse of so short an interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is incorrigible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>He resembles the <rs n="Bourbon" type="royalfamily">Bourbon</rs> more than anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>He learns nothing, and he forgets nothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> We hope, however, this threat of another invasion will not be lost on Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is wrong that the whole weight of it should fall on the brave troops who have already fought so well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>That it will be attempted if we should fall to drive them from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, does not admit of a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>In the name of the country, then, we entreat Congress to perfect its measures for increasing the army as soon as it can. </p> </div3>
