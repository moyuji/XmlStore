<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The Convention was called to order at the usual hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Not more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the members were present, and very few spectators. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Prayer by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Petigeur,Reverend,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Petigeur,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Southall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Southall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Southall</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName>, rose to a privileged question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He said he received a few days ago a copy of the proceedings of a meeting held at <placeName reg="Scottsville, Albemarle, Virginia" key="tgn,2114158">Scottsville, in Albemarle county</placeName>, and considered this the place for replying to an allusion to himself in <num value="1">one</num> of the resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He conceded the perfect right of any portion of the people, whether few or many, to assemble for deliberation on affairs of public concern, and, if need be, to criticise the conduct of those to whom they had entrusted the discharge of public duties; but he also held that it would be proper for them to possess themselves of full information previous to passing judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The resolutions were read by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Southall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Southall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Southall</surname></persName>.</hi> They censure him for his course in the <rs>Convention</rs>, and instruct him to vote for an Ordinance of Secession, in accordance with the tendency of his campaign speech at <placeName reg="Scottsville, Albemarle, Virginia" key="tgn,2114158">Scottsville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Southall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Southall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Southall</surname></persName></hi> corrected the impression which had been sought to be created as to his course in the canvass, that he would go for secession unless the difficulties were adjusted before the <date value="03-04">4th of March.</date> His position was, that unless there were a prospect of an adjustment before the adjournment of the <rs>Convention</rs>, no alternative would be left to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> but to resume the powers which she delegated to the <rs>General Government</rs>; and to show that injustice was done him in these resolutions, he read from publications which he addressed to the people of <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName> previous to the assembling of this Convention, taking the ground which he here indicated.--Upon this evidence he claimed that the charges against him were unjustifiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He paid a compliment to the intelligence of the people of <placeName reg="Scottsville, Albemarle, Virginia" key="tgn,2114158">Scottsville</placeName>, whose confidence he had enjoyed during the period of his political life; but in the late election he fell far short of a majority at that precinct, showing that they were fully aware of the position he had occupied in the canvass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>With regard to his course in the <rs>Convention</rs>, he claimed that there had not been a solitary vote taken which went to commit any gentleman as to his ulterior purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Yet these good people had hastily condemned him, with no shadow of evidence to sustain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In reference to the right of instruction, he had never entertained but <num value="1">one</num> opinion; and that was, that as between the representative and his constituents, upon every question of expediency, he was the direct representative of his immediate constituents, and to them he was responsible for his action, though to some extent he might be the representative of the <rs>State</rs> at large.--He believed that since the election of delegates to this body, those with whom he had differed had increased in number, though to what extent he was unable to say. Whenever it could be shown to him which side had the majority, it would be his duty to reflect their wishes; but so long as there was a doubt, he should adhere to the position he had occupied from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The Convention, according to order, went into <orgName n="Whole Committee" type="committee">Committee of the Whole</orgName>, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Southall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Southall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Southall</surname></persName></hi> in the chair, for the purpose of considering the report of the <rs>Committee</rs> on Federal Relations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Barbour,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Barbour,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barbour</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, took the floor, and resumed his remarks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> He commenced with an allusion to the bankrupt condition of the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and produced a circular addressed to the census-takers of this State, setting forth that the <rs>Government</rs> was unable to pay for the service rendered by these officers, but would do so as soon as possible, and advising them not to dispose of their claims at a sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A Government so deficient in the &#x0022;sinews of war&#x0022; was entitled to but little consideration from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He then introduced evidence on the other hand, to show that the <rs>Southern Republic</rs> was possessed of all the essential elements of a high and national character; --in point of wealth and resources, greatly in advance of the <rs>North</rs>.--Was a <orgName n="Virginia Assembly" type="assembly">Virginia assembly</orgName> to sit here and not recognize a fact which was about to be acknowledged by all the <name>Powers</name> on earth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The nationality of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, as a Government <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">de facto,</foreign></hi> as shown by a publication in the <orgName n="London News" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">News</hi></orgName>, was to be recognized by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and it would be by all other Governments, unless <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should unfortunately constitute the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Yet here it was proposed to adjourn over for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, with a view to continue the <rs>Union</rs> with a bankrupt Government, shutting our eyes meanwhile to the great events going on in the world around us. The Washington Government had not yet proclaimed its recognition of the <rs>Confederated Government</rs>, yet all its acts were based upon such a recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If it was a fact that there was a separate independent Government at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, was it not wrong to refuse to look to that fact, and to persist in these impotent efforts towards an amicable relation with the <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>True statesmanship, he conceived, was governed by circumstances, and so every member ought to be governed, without reference to any card that he might have published before the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The man who to-day insists that the course of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should be controlled by circumstances as they existed on the <date value="01-01">1st day of January,</date> closes his eyes to the events that have been transpiring around us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Barbour,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Barbour,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barbour</surname></persName></hi> would go into no Free-Soil Government, separated from the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If they are brought back, it will have to be done by regular treaty and annexation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They would never, he contended, give up their Government, wholly devoted as it was to their interests, on a mere sentiment of attachment to old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The majority report recognizes the fact that there are <num value="2">two</num> Governments, and desires to confer upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs> the power to deal peaceably with the question, and to make treaties with the seceded States; thus recognizing their independence, but still asking for a <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>,</hi> to treat with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>A <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName> to negotiate with the seceded States, for the protection of your interests, while you are on the side of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, covenanting with them for the protection of those interests!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>This was a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> trick in which he desired no part.--You were to sit, with folded arms, aloof from the seceded States, while the <rs>North</rs> was to negotiate a treaty with them for your protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>If we had to go through this probation, as the <rs>Committee</rs> of <num value="21">Twenty-One</num> and <persName n="Seward,Mister,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> say we have to, extending through a period of <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, it was his opinion that we should wait in the house of our friends, instead of in the house of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The fact was recognized that the <rs>Union</rs> was dissolved, and he asked why there should be any fear in choosing between the <num value="2">two</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Was there any danger to be apprehended in the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He thought there was great danger in the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The former afforded complete protection and relief; and to sustain this position, <persName n="Barbour,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Barbour,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barbour</surname></persName> produced abundant statistics of Southern trade, demonstrating the certainty of the revenue to accrue from the great staples produced in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States, and contrasting it with the undesirable condition of the <rs>Northern Government</rs>, cut off from all the material advantages of commerce and manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He assumed that if the whole <rs>South</rs> would at once take a position to make the <rs>Northern</rs> people feel their dependence, they would submit to any terms; but he opposed an experiment going through any length of time, and then letting Yankeedom come in on their own terms, with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> swinging on as an appendage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> In proceeding to urge the policy of uniting with the seceded States, <persName n="Barbour,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Barbour,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barbour</surname></persName> satirized with some keenness the course of those &#x0022;statesmen&#x0022; in the <rs>Convention</rs> who professed to know what <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ought to do in the emergency, but distrusted the intelligence of the people in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He was equally caustic in his references to the proposed adjournment and to the <orgName n="Border Conference" type="conference">Border Conference</orgName>.--The tendency of some of the <rs>Border States</rs> towards abolitionism was freely commented upon, and applied as an argument against their fitness to advise old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> what to do with her half <num value="1000000">million</num> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He hoped the <rs>Committee</rs> would open their eyes to the astounding fact that, in the proposed conference, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> would own <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of all the slaves there represented; and that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, owning <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the whole number, would be entitled to but <num value="1">one</num> vote among the <num value="8">eight</num> States in consultation.--This argument, he conceived, dispelled the claim of an identity of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>If it was the intention of gentlemen to destroy the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, they would pursue precisely the policy laid down in the majority report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This report he criticised at length, maintaining that if this Convention were an abolition <orgName n="Aid Society" type="society">aid society</orgName>, it could not more effectually attain the object of such an association than by adopting the whole programme, as there laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>To the <rs>Western</rs> men he addressed the argument that every movement towards the destruction of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> would to that extent render necessary an increase of taxes upon their lands, to meet the liabilities arising from the <rs>State</rs> debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was, therefore, their interest that the value of the slave property in the <rs>East</rs> should not be depreciated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> In conclusion, he asked the members of the <rs>Committee</rs> if they were willing to leave this Commonwealth without a government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It was acknowledged that the <rs>Union</rs> was dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Becoming indebted to the <rs>North</rs> for these purchases, it is necessary for her to ship her exports, for the most part, to Northern cities, in liquidation of the indebtedness; whence they are exported by Northern merchants, on their own account, to the markets of the world.--But this fact only proves that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has been made tributary to the <rs>North</rs>, by an unnatural manipulation of commerce &mdash; not that the <rs>North</rs> is a consumer of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> part of her shipments thither &mdash; not that this condition of trade is natural or profitable to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; on the contrary, it is most unnatural and unprofitable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> has produced <num value="2">two</num> tariffs, which, if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> became a part of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, cuts her aloof from the <rs>North</rs> and throws open to her manufactures and products of all kinds, duty free, the markets of those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>At the same time that these markets are opened free to all of her export products, such as grain, tobacco, flour, cattle, horses, mules, negroes, machinery, and manufactures of all sorts, giving her a preference over the <rs>Northern</rs> and Western States for these articles, and a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> profit equal to the duty on the articles, she will be separated from the <rs>North</rs> by a high Northern tariff that will put an end to the monopoly which that section now holds upon her trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>At present, New York is the grand funnel through which the whole trade of the <rs>South</rs>, of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> especially, is made to pass &mdash; is the grand Maelstrom which swallows up and engulfs the profits and wealth of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>In the shipment of such an article as cotton, time, itself, becomes money; and that line of transportation which affords the most expeditious transit will always common the bulk of the freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>And, we may add, that in the absence of any well founded complaints against the present management, it is at least unwise to make a change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>And further, we would ask what security have the citizens, that if the gentleman who is now recommended so highly is elected, that there will be such an economical management as is to be desired?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>So far as we know of him he is a gentleman, and all who come in contact with him are favorably impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>His reputation is unblemished, and his manners are affable and prepossessing, and we disclaim any intention to intimate aught against him. <unclear></unclear> have a right to know if a candidate for <unclear></unclear> a place as this possesses, besides all the desirable qualities above named, the less showy, but not less useful qualification, of capacity for administration, and the talent for economical expenditure and management of finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>How far has the experience of those who have had their affairs administered by this gentleman, justified them in recommending him to the confidence of the people as <num value="1">one</num> who can judiciously purchase for, and prudently attend to, the outlays for such an establishment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>For without these valuable, but too much neglected qualities, the best Mechanical and <rs type="role" reg="Civil-Engineer">Civil Engineer</rs> would make but a poor substitute for the gentleman who now quietly and modestly, but safely and prudently, manages this important department of our city's service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/> We presume, however, that the principal object of the gentlemen who have brought out <persName n="Sharp,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="nearbymention:Sharp,Thomas,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sharp</surname></persName>, had less reference to his capacity as a manager than to his peculiar political principles, and their object is, doubtless, to unite upon him (if possible) the strength of those who favor the secession of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>In this they have reckoned without their host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>Although we have not taken sides with this party, and are not ashamed to say that we are willing to wait a little farther the developments of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s administration before we favor this move, yet we are free to admit, that the party now in our city who do favor prompt action on this subject at present numbers many of those who are most deeply interested in the welfare of our city, and who sincerely seek her best interests; and we are farther satisfied that they know, while the election of <persName n="Sharp,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="nearbymention:Sharp,Thomas,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sharp</surname></persName>, as the secession candidate, would show their strength, and, all other things being equal, would be a triumph of which they would be proud, yet they are not willing to sacrifice the pecuniary interests of the city for such a triumph; and we know that many of them regard this as a most unsuitable occasion upon which to propose a test of their strength in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>We are willing, however, to admit, that if there is to be a test, that no more suitable person could be selected as the standard-bearer of a <orgName n="Secession party" type="party">secession party</orgName> than this gentleman; and we honestly ask, if there is no fear among those who have nominated him that they have too much of a good thing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>or, in other words, may he not be <hi rend="italics">too much of a secessionist?</hi> If we have been correctly informed, the history of <persName n="Sharp,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00302" reg="nearbymention:Sharp,Thomas,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sharp</surname></persName> will confirm the statement that he has been a secessionist all his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>He <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seceded from a Northern State, at an early age, and came to this city.--He next seceded to <num value="2">two</num> Northern shops, in <num value="2">two</num> Northern States, while serving a short apprenticeship; after which he seceded to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, and again to <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, where he had charge of a railroad, from which he seceded, leaving the company oblivious as to the cause or his intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Then, again, he came to this city, where he had charge of the <orgName n="York River Railroad" type="railroad">York River Railroad</orgName>, from which he seceded without making known his purposes until, the patience of the <name>Directory</name> being exhausted, they elected his successor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>With such precedents, we would like to know what sort of security can be given that he would not, if elected, secede from the <orgName n="Gas Works" type="works">Gas Works</orgName> before the end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year, and leave the citizens in doubt whether they had a Superintendent of the <orgName n="Gas Works" type="works">Gas Works</orgName> or not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>If we may judge of the future by the past, this question is worthy of the consideration of our citizens, and we candidly ask those who are interested in the welfare of the city, of what use will it be to turn out a good officer and put in <num value="1">one</num> whose precedents do not too highly recommend him for the post? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/> The folly of testing the strength of the <name>Secession</name> and Union parties at the municipal election will, we are satisfied, meet with no approval from the citizens at large; and for this important position we hope the citizens will rally, as <num value="1">one</num> man, to sustain a native-born <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, of whose loyalty to the <rs>State</rs> there can be no question, against the pretensions of <num value="1">one</num> of Northern blood, and birth, and lineage, whose claims are but a newly-fledged admiration of a party which is evidently in the ascendant, for the purpose of getting assistance to step into a comfortable situation. </p> <closer> <signed>A <orgName n="Tax Payer" type="newspaper">Tax-Payer</orgName> and Gas Consumer.</signed> <term type="printrun">ap 2--1t</term> </closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/> Since we left the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> we have had quite an agreeable cruise, so far. After a passage of <measure n="23days" type="date">twenty-three days</measure> and some hours from <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, we arrived at <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>During the passage we had a fine chance of testing the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></hi> and her qualities. --We had plenty of wind, sea, sail and steam, in all of which she has disappointed us. She cannot hold her own on the wind, her bottom being so round, and keel too small to keep her from making lee-way; and in any kind of rough sea, she can out-rock any of your patent cradles for babies; and under sail or steam, or both combined, she is very slow, in comparison to what was expected of her. The impression seems to be that her propeller is too small, and too near the surface of the water; it being so near the surface that in an ordinary swell on the ocean it is thrown out of the water, thereby causing the engine to race badly, consequently racking the machinery to a certain extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>However, she makes up for all in her good looks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>She has been the beauty of every harbor we have visited; and being kept strictly clean, entices many visitors, and receives man flattering praises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName> is all that it is represented to be &mdash; the greatest fort in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>I don't think it possible that it could be taken in any way, even if half manned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Just imagine an excavated and towering rock, about twice the circumference of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>, pierced with hundreds of port-holes, so that guns can be brought to bear on any conceivable point of attack, and you may form some idea of its impenetrableness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>Its capacity for accommodation of soldiers is immense, it being galleried off, and any quantity of rooms and quarters for officers and soldiers erected therein, the whole being studded with <num value="1000000">millions</num> of feet of heavy timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>At the base of the rock is a very nice little city, containing about <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> inhabitants, composed of all nations, from the sooty <rs>Ethiopia</rs> and turbaned <persName n="Moor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00401" reg="mostcommon:Moor,nomatch:0"><surname>Moor</surname></persName>, to the fine, fine old <name>English</name> gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The whole island is enclosed by a <orgName n="Water Battery" type="battery">water battery</orgName> that protects every accessible landing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>It is indeed the key to the <name>Mediterranean</name>, situated as it is in proximity to the opposite shore, as <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> to the <name>Rip</name>-Raps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/> We stood on our decks and had fine views of parts of <num value="2">two</num> countries &mdash; i. e., <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>The scenes were very interesting to any reflecting mind, requiring an immensity of thought to try to trace and locate the many historical facts and legendary accounts connected with this world-renowned locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The natural scenes are very grand, being sublimely mountainous, and dotted here and there with towns and villages, citadels and cloisters, and clean and white farm houses, or, perhaps, a tented city of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>In all, it strikes <num value="1">one</num> with those feelings that bring him, as it were, with awe to the presence of that Almighty Being, whose will created and peopled those wonderful scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>After a stay of <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, we left <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName> for Spezzia, in <placeName key="tgn,7003121" n="1.000 19" reg="sardegna">Sardinia</placeName>, where we arrived, after a pleasant passage of <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>. Spezzia is beautifully situated, but scatteringly built around a part of an amphitheater-shaped bay, almost land-locked with towering mountains, affording an excellent and safe harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The scenery around it, at this season of the year, is very romantic; and, from all accounts, it is really enchanting in the summer season, at which time the city is very lively, being a watering place, and the resort of the nabobs of the country.--I have had some very pleasant rambles around the meandering of the bay, and about the farm-houses, getting acquainted with the owners and drinking the pure juice of the grape, of their own making.
