<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> He commenced by comparing the situation of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to that of landsman overtaken by storm in the midst of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> &mdash; the ship tossing to and fro, and threatened by icebergs, whose contact would crush it down forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We were upon the verge of revolution &mdash; a powerful struggle between the life and death of a people, and the simple prayer &#x0022;For life!&#x0022; put into the mouth of a hero by the oldest of poets on the eve of battle, was now recalled to his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He for <num value="1">one</num> was ready to raise his arm to repel the storm &mdash; and to avert the horrors of deadly strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It was the duty of the <rs>Christian</rs> and the patriot, however remote might be the danger, to resist it in its incipiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The danger, he believed, was impending, and the present was the time to avert it. The people of <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName>, where reposed the remains of <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, the author of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, had declared, when the cloud <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appeared, that it was time to make another <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He went on to advert to the history of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>When that instrument was adopted, the question of sectionalism was scarcely more than a dream; but that passive indifference has been vitalized into <num value="1">one</num> of the most violent conditions of discord that has ever convulsed a nation, and there was no doubt that this discord sprang from an irrepressible conflict of opinions which were driving the nation to destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The Northern people had struck a blow at our rights, disregarding the very basis of common prosperity, equality of rights, and pursued a system of injustice towards us, thus commencing a revolution as disastrous as that of a foreign enemy upon our soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This had lasted through a period of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, and his mind had become settled in the conclusion that we could live together no longer under a common Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Neither the <rs>Crittenden Propositions</rs> nor those of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> possessed the elements essential to the security of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Expansion, with us, was a measure of safety, and though <num value="1">one</num> of the sections reported by the <rs>Committee</rs> guaranteed this to some extent, it did not go far enough, Unless expansion could be secured, the ultimate extinction of slavery was inevitable.-- The policy of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> was like &#x0022;surrounding the scorpion with a belt of fire.&#x0022; There were at present <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> slaves in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and according to the laws of nature there would be in <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> <num value="16000000">16,000,000</num>--or <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> more than the whole <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> population in all the <rs>Southern States</rs> at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>With the proper means of expansion for the diffusion of the slave population, the density of the white population would be promoted; whereas, without such means, the black population would increase as before stated in a circumscribed space, and thus, within the life-time of our children, the way would be prepared for all the horrors of servile war. His argument in this connection was able and elaborate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He conceived this question of territorial expansion to be the rock upon which every scheme of compromise would be wrecked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> He proceeded to examine the subject in its political bearings &mdash; the possibility of taking the power of government from the hands of extremists and placing it in the hands of moderate men in both sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The concessions to be made by the <rs>North</rs>, if any are to be made, must be such as to quiet forever the agitation of the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The <placeName reg="Southampton, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050609">Southampton</placeName> tragedy was the result of agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> raid was the result of agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>With agitation constantly sounding in the ears of the slave, could we expect anything else than an occasional outburst of violence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The amendments proposed by the committee contained no assurance of the removal of this agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The subject of slavery would still be mixed up with the politics of the <rs>North</rs>, in the waging of what they call a moral war upon the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>No such amendments can change the anti-slavery sentiment of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> had not been formed upon the basis of a temporary expediency, but upon deep-seated convictions of right and wrong, which must never be relinquished until its object is accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The passion was the most immovable that had ever seized upon the minds of a people, and he had no hope that it would ever be eradicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He then read extracts from the speeches of their representative men, beginning with <persName n="Burlingame,,Anson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="default:Burlingame,Anson,,,"><foreName>Anson</foreName> <surname>Burlingame</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, expressive of the most ultra abolition sentiments; next, <persName n="Hale,,John,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="default:Hale,John,P.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, of similar import, and called attention to the &#x0022;extract of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>&#x0022; read yesterday by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Randolph,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>;</hi> also, to the well-known declarations of <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He asked if any present declaration from <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> could reconcile the <rs>Southern</rs> people to his past professions as the very head and front of the irrepressible conflict, and as the man who had calumniated the decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> The question of party was not considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He contended that when parties became sectional, their antagonism was like the antagonism of countries entirely foreign to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He quoted from the writings of <persName n="Madison,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>(<num value="10">No. 10</num>,) in regard to factious combinations of a majority, and showing the security necessary to resist them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In the early history of the country, (he went on to say,) we did enjoy adequate security, but a great party had now been formed on the cohesive principle of hostility to slavery, sufficient to overpower all the checks and balances of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In the free States, every party consideration had been merged in this principle, and the people supported men for office who adopted the largest proportion of the abolition element in their political <rs n="Cree" type="nativeamerican">cree</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We could not trust to such people for security against oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They had rendered the elective franchise utterly worthless to the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They had transferred the decision of all the great questions connected with slavery to the forum of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Unless, perchance, there should be a division in the ranks of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> in the ensuing <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, it would be the merest folly for the <rs>Southern States</rs> to open an electoral poll in the next Presidential elec- <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> tion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>He would not exchange the inalienable rights once enjoyed under the dome of the <rs type="place">Temple of Liberty</rs>, for all the possible advantages which have been so glowingly pictured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The reporter does not pretend to give more than a faint outline of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Holcomer,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Holcomer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holcomer</surname></persName>'s</hi> remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Indeed, the omission of a sentence, or even a word, of his thrilling eloquence, would, unquestionably, mar the beauty of this grand effort in behalf of the rights of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>He spoke of the humiliating attitude of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, bowing her neck to the yoke of Northern tyranny, and said that the retribution of a just <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> must sooner or latter overtake a people who would surrender their cherished rights to a mere consideration of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Tell me not, said he, of what our ancestors said in their day. Their maxims and sentiments were wise in their time; true reverence for the memory of our fathers consists not in applying their precepts to the events of our day, but rather in applying them as they would now, were they living and in the field of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>No doubt they hoped the <rs>Union</rs> might be perpetual &mdash; that Liberty and Union might be <num value="1">one</num> and inseparable, now and forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>There is a higher sentiment, breathing in all the fragmentary elements of the past; it is embodied in that glorious scene (pointing to the picture of <placeName reg="Washington Crossing, Bucks, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2094200">Washington crossing</placeName> the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>) which so fitly graces the hall where <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s representatives are now deliberating upon her future welfare; it speaks in that majestic form and in that eagle eye, imparting hope to every patriot and every lover of his country in her darkest hour of trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It says to us, if this Union and Liberty cannot exist together, cast the <rs>Union</rs> to the winds, and clasp Liberty to your bosom!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>[Applause.] </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He inadvertently said yesterday that the tax paid by the slave property of the <rs>State</rs> was <measure n="163000dollars" type="currency">$163,000</measure>; but he should have said <measure n="326000dollars" type="currency">$326,000</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>He conceived that the interest and glory of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, as well as her honor in the future, demanded that the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be amended in this particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>He then adverted to the <rs>State</rs> debt, to be augmented by the action of the <name>Legislature</name>, and by her guaranteed bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Adding the sums together, he showed the debt of the <rs>State</rs>, to be provided for by taxation, at the enormous amount of <measure n="45091152.87dollars" type="currency">$45,091,152.87</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> The act calling the <rs>Convention</rs> together contemplated proper amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and in the section of the country from which he came that subject was agitated as much as the subject of Federal relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Ordinances of secession had been offered here, and resolutions upon the matter of military defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>If an Ordinance of Secession were to pass, the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> would have to be prepared to resist encroachments, and a standing army for that purpose, he contended, would cost <num value="1000000">millions</num> upon <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>He respectfully declined any such bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> &#x0022;It is a lie, in the fifth place, because money has been much more plenty since the <rs>State</rs> seceded than before; and as an evidence of it not a dollar of the bonds of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have been sold below par, but, on the other hand, they have generally commanded a handsome premium.

<head>The <name>French</name> encampment at <placeName key="tgn,7002857" n="1.000 1" reg="bayrut,bayrut,al-lubnan,asia">Beirut</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002857" n="1.000 1" reg="bayrut,bayrut,al-lubnan,asia">Beirut</placeName> claims especial attention from its connection with the massacres of <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>Entering the bay we anchored among a fleet of war vessels, mostly Turks, with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> <persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00491" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>A single <name>British</name> corvette lay anchored a long way off in a safer bay. The other vessels of the <orgName n="English fleet" type="fleet">English fleet</orgName> had been ordered to the <rs>Adriatic</rs>, in view of the uncertainties of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Thus, the <rs>French</rs> are left nearly alone in the defence or protection of <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>I presume <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00492" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> does not regret his advantage, and doubtless will make the most of it. He occupies <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>, and you may depend upon it he will never leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>You have been often informed that he has an army of a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> quartered in the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,7002857" n="1.000 1" reg="bayrut,bayrut,al-lubnan,asia">Beirut</placeName>, and among the mountains of <placeName reg="Lebanon, Wilson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100035">Lebanon</placeName>.-- I had the pleasure of visiting the <rs>French</rs> encampment about <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> from the city, containing, perhaps, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5000">five thousand</num> French and Algerians. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> I made the trip over a French road, in a French omnibus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>This road is the beginning of the road to <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Damascus</placeName>, and means some thing more than an effort to increase the locomotive privileges of the residents of <placeName key="tgn,7002857" n="1.000 1" reg="bayrut,bayrut,al-lubnan,asia">Beirut</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Damascus</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Very recently, I am told by a gentleman long resident in <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 23" reg="asia">Palestine</placeName>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00493" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> received a valuable present of a fortress in the <rs type="place">Lebanon mountains</rs>, from the wife of a deceased <persName><foreName>Pasha</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Whatever may be the future of <name>French</name> occupancy, the past and present is to be accredited to the humane desire of the <rs>Emperor</rs> to suppress the horrible butcheries of the <name>Druses</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>His own prompt action alone saved the unbutchered of <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>, and his forces must remain to insure their safety. -- But to return to visit to the encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The roads <unclear></unclear> amid mulberry groves and hedges of <unclear>us.</unclear> <persName n="Cates,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00494" reg="mostcommon:Cates,nomatch:0"><surname>Cates</surname></persName> for <persName n="Turk,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00495" reg="mostcommon:Turk,nomatch:0"><surname>Turk</surname></persName> and <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs> her spring up along the way, and seem well patronized, notwithstanding they present little of the attractiveness of the cafes of the <name>Boulevards</name> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00496" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/> The road was filled with <name>French</name> soldiers, Turkish soldiers, Algerines, Bedouins, horsemen and footmen, donkeys and donkey men, camels and camel men, and women with various costumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Our <name>French</name> omnibus, with its team of mules and horses, and its black Nubian driver, added to the strange mingling of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> and the <rs>Oriental</rs>, the ancient and the modern, the stereotyped and the progressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>We stopped in front of a large <name>French</name> cafe close by the encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Here a large band were enlivening the gay scene with martial music, and people of all nations were sipping their coffee and smoking their &#x0022;Sultana&#x0022; or &#x0022;Latakia.&#x0022; The main portion of the <rs>French</rs> are encamped in &#x0022;the <rs type="place">Pines</rs>&#x0022; a fine growth of pine trees springing out of naked sands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Little if any arrangement is observable in placing of the tents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/> The <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs>, true to his tastes, seeks to ornament even his camp, though, like this, it be in a sand desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Grass and flowers and running vines were growing around the tents, and spaces were laid out in curves and angles, and planted in various flowers and verdure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>Under <name>French</name> taste, even the desert blossoms as the rose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>The camp-fires were smouldering and the soldiers were sitting at their evening meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Their table was the ground and their seats the ground, and yet they contrived by digging a trench around their table not to sit cross-legged like the <name>Turk</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Most of the tents are small, and afford only an indifferent shelter from the winter rains.--Various trades necessary to the camp were carried on, such as tailoring, harness-making, shoe-making, blacksmithing, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/> The <placeName key="tgn,2129174" n="1.000 10" reg="Algerine, Tuolumne, California">Algerine</placeName> forces are encamped in the open field, beneath the piercing rays of a <rs n="Syrian" type="ethnic">Syrian</rs> sun. Their horses are in like manner tied out, exposed to all changes of the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>They were preparing their suppers at their scanty camp-fires, and it was amusing to see <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of these wild Algerines squatting over their pot or pan, smoking and chatting their Arabic, while every eye was fixed on the meat and potatoes which they were extemporizing into food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Their dress is similar to that of the <name>Bedouin</name>, but their eyes are keener and their appearance I thought more sprightly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> A Hungarian General remarked to me, that I had seen the &#x0022;highest perfection of military encampment;&#x0022; this is a real army encampment, not the showy demonstration of annual parades, and I am satisfied that many a young military aspirant would be thoroughly cured by a couple of months' confinement here.--<hi rend="italics">Letters from <persName n="Baylies,Reverend-Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00497" reg="mostcommon:Baylies,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Doctor">Rev.
