<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>When the barges were within a few yards of the land the troops attached to our <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">signal corps</orgName> at that point from an ambush poured into them such a murderous volley of musketry as caused them to make a precipitate flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Rapidly moving forward his skirmishers to accurately develop his position, they became soon engaged, and there ensued <num value="1">one</num> of the hottest skirmishes of the war.--The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> skirmishers, far exceeding ours, were held in check by the firm stand of <orgName n="sharpshooters"><persName n="Reynolds,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Reynolds,A.,W.,,"><surname>Reynolds</surname></persName>'s sharpshooters</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> But the line of these gallant <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, North <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, and Alabamians, present an unbroken front, and receiving the fire, they return it with continuous and repeated volleys, which drive him back chagrined and discomfited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Now they resort again to artillery, and at long reach keep up a terrific shelling of the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Again, their infantry comes largely reinforced, and again he drives them back steadily inch by inch until, reaching an open field, they could stand it no longer, and ran every way in the most dire disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>At <num value="10">ten</num> in the night they sneak off altogether, and at day in the morning nothing is seen of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> --The following is a beautiful description of a fountain of water in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> Taking a narrow path, I crossed through some dense underwood, and all at once I stood on the banks of the <rs type="place">Wakulla spring</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>There was a basin of water <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> in diameter, almost circular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The thicks bushes were almost growing to the water's edge, and bowing their heads under the unripened surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>I stopped into a skiff and pushed off. Some immense fishes attracted my attention and I seized a spear to strike them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The boatman laughed and asked me how far beneath the surface I supposed they were?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>I answered about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure>. He assured me that they were at least <num value="20">twenty</num> from me, and it was so. The water is of the most marvellous transparency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>I dropped an ordinary pin in the water; <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> deep, and saw its head with perfect distinctness as <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> day on the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>As we approached the centre I noticed a jagged, grayish limestone rock beneath us pierced with holes; through these holes <num value="1">one</num> seemed to look into unfathomable depths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The boat moved slowly on, and now we hung trembling over the edge of the sunken cliff, and far below it lay a dark, yawning, unfathomable abyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>From its gorge comes pouring forth, with immense velocity, a living river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> Pushing on just beyond its mouth I dropped a <num value="10">ten</num> cent piece into the water, which is there <measure n="190feet" type="distance">190 feet</measure> in depth, and I clearly saw it shining on the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>This seems incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>I think the water possessed a magnifying power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>I am confident that the piece could not be so distinctly soon from a tower <measure n="190feet" type="distance">190 feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>We rowed on toward the north side, and suddenly we perceived in the water, which were darting hither and thither, the long flexible roots and the wide luxuriant grasses on the bottom, all arrayed in the most beautiful prismatic hues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The gentle swell occasioned by the boat gave to the whole an undulating motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Deathlike skinless reigned around, and a more fairy scene I never beheld. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> So great is the quantity of water here poured forth that it forms a river itself, large enough to float flatboats with cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The planter who lives here has thus transported his cotton to <placeName key="tgn,2640643" n="1.000 4" reg="san marcos, wakulla, florida">St. Marks</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Near the fountain we saw some of the remains of a mastedon, which had been taken from it. The triangular bone below the knee measured <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> on each side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Almost the entire skeleton has been sent to <persName n="Barnum,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Barnum,nomatch:0"><surname>Barnum</surname></persName>'s Museum. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Forgetting the loud thunder shock of battle, and all save his dead brother, he knelt down, and fondly kissing his smiling lips, and pressing his manly brow, sadly exclaimed, &#x0022;noble brother!&#x0022; while the tears fell thick and fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Oh! what a tide of agonizing emotion must fill the heart when the soldier weeps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The lips of the lion hearted General, which during the day seemed made of iron, now quivered with unutterable feeling, and the eye that had never blanched in the wildest of battle now flowed with tears.
