<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The lesson <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> of high water, on which our enemies relied to enable their fleet of gunboats to penetrate into our country and devastate our homes, is fast passing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Yet, our strongholds on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> still bid defiance to the foe, and months of vastly preparations for their reduction have been spent in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Within a few weeks the falling waters and the increasing heats of summer will complete their discomfiture, and compel their battled and defeated forces to the abandonment of expeditions on which was based their chief hope of l sucesse in effecting our subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> We must not forget, however, that the war is not yet ended, and that we are still confronted by powerful armies, and threatened by numerous fleets; and that the <rs>Government</rs> which controls those fleets and armies is driven to the most desperate efforts to effect the unholy purposes in which it has thus far been defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>It will use its utmost energy to avert the impending doom, so fully merited by the atrocities it has committed, the savage barbarities which it has encouraged, and the crowning infamy of its attempt to excite a servile population to the massacre of our wives, our daughters, and our helpless children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> With such a contest before us there is but <num value="1">one</num> danger which the <rs>Government</rs> of your choice regards with apprehension, and to avert this danger it appeals to the never falling patriotism and spirit of self sacrifice which you have exhibited since the beginning of the war. The very unfavorable season, the protracted droughts of last year reduced the harvests on which we depended far below an average yield, and the deficiency was unfortunately still more marked in the <rs>Northern</rs> portion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> where supplies were specially needed for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It, through a confidence in early peace, which may prove diffusive our fields should be now devoted to the production of cotton and tobacco instead of grain and live stock, and other articles necessary for the subsistence of the people and the army the consequences may prove serious if not disastrous, especially should the present season prove as unfavorable as the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Your country, therefore, appeals to you to lay aside all thought of gain and to devote yourselves to securing your liberties, without which those gains would be valueless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>It is true that the wheat harvest in the more Southern States which will be gathered next month promises an abundant yield; but even in this promise be fulfill the difficulty of transportation, enhanced as it has been by an unusually rainy winter, will cause embarrassments in military operations and suffering among the people, should the crops in the middle and northern portions of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> prove deficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>But no uneasiness need be felt in regard to a mere supply of bread for man. It is for the large amount of corn and forage required for the raising of live stock, and for the supply of the animals used in military operations that your aid is specially required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>These articles are too bulky for distant transportation, and in them the deficiency in the last harvest was most felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Let your fields be devoted exclusively to the production of corn, oats, beans, peas, potatoes, and other food for man and beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Let corn be sown broad cast for fodder, in immediate proximity to railroads, rivers, and canals, and let all your efforts be directed to the prompt supply of these articles in the districts where our armies are operating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>You will thus add greatly to their efficiency, and furnish the means without which it is impracticable to make those prompt and active movements which have hitherto stricken terror into our enemies, and secured our most brilliant triumphs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> Having thus placed before you, my countrymen, the reasons for the call made on you for aid in supplying the wants of the coming year, I add a few words of appeal in behalf of the brave soldiers now confronting your enemies, and to whom your Government is unable to furnish all the comforts they so richly merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The supply of meat for the army is deficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>This deficiency is only temporary, or measures have been adopted which will, it is believed, soon enable us to restore the full ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>But that ration is now reduced at times to <num value="0.5">one half</num> the usual quantity in some of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>It is known that the supply of meat throughout the country is sufficient for the support of all, but the distances are so great, the condition of the roads has been so bad during the <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> of winter weather through which we have just passed, and the attempts of groveling speculators to forestall the market and make money out of the life blood of our defenders, have so much influenced the withdrawal from sale of the surplus in the hands of the producers that the <rs>Government</rs> has been unable to gather full supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> has prepared a plan, which is appended to this address, by the aid of which, or some similar means to be adopted by yourselves, you can assist the officers of the <rs>Government</rs> in the purchase of the bacon the pork and the beef, known to exist in large quantities in different parts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Even if the surplus be less than is believed, is it not a bitter and humiliating reflection that those who remain at home, secure from hardship and protected from danger, should be in the enjoyment of abundance, and that their slaves also should have a full supply of food, while their sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers are allotted in the rations on which their health and efficiency depend. </p>
