<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It is by no means certain that it will be necessary to have any successor to those gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the first place, it is within the limits of possibility that through a demand of the <rs>British Government</rs>, these gentlemen may yet be released from their confinement, and placed on a British deck under the <rs>British</rs> flag, from the protection of which they were so violently and illegally taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In that event, they can proceed on their voyage and execute their mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is not only possible, but, in the opinion of many competent judges, it is probable that the <rs>British Government</rs> will insist upon at least that degree of reparation to the insulted dignity of the <rs>British</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If such a demand be made, we believe that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government would accede to it at once, for, with all their prodigious boasting, they will never dare to provoke a war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At all events, till that question is determined, it is at least due to our commissioned representatives to make no new appointments, a proceeding which, moreover, would expose us to the embarrassment of having, in the event of their release, <num value="2">two</num> sets of Commissioners to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But supposing it definitely determined that the <rs>British Government</rs> will not interfere in their behalf, it is questionable policy whether other gentlemen should be sent from this country to take their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There are Southern gentlemen now in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, who could perform their duties, and this without the risk which attends a voyage across the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At all events, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> should carefully keep its own counsels as to any purpose it may form upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If it is important that we should have Commissioners abroad, it is important that we should adopt all the means necessary to the successful accomplishment of that end, and among those means, none is more essential than profound silence as to what we intend to do.--We ought to know by this time, from bitter experience, that to make public an intention of sending Commissioners, and still more the names of those Commissioners, is the surest way of defeating our own object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The late appointments were made known, and the circumstances attending the departure of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> had as much publicity as if there were no obstacles whatever to impede their transit across the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is clear that if successors are to be sent, the only prudent course is not even to let it be known that there is any such intention, and especially that the names of the appointees should not be whispered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If appointed, let them get off in profound silence, and with none of the pomp and circumstance of an ambassadorial mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>With the observance of these precautions, we may succeed in getting ministers to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in case the <rs>Government</rs> deems such a commission necessary, of which we are by no means certain. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>For many years <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> has conferred upon him her highest honors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But when the war commenced he volunteered as a private, and has been serving on foot as a Captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Recently, some <num value="20">twenty</num> prominent <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> officers in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> addressed him a letter, urging him to accept the place of <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> in the permanent Congress and giving as a reason that he can be of more service in the <name>Senate</name> than on foot in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>From his reply we make the following extract: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> &#x0022;When I took up arms in defence of the <rs>South</rs> it was to illustrate by example the heartfelt sincerity with which I had for so many years urged our people to strike for equality in the <rs>Union</rs>, or independence out of it. I cannot now, camped as we are in sight of the enemy, consent to lay down these armes, except it be to render my bleeding country more efficient service somewhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>If we wanted a convincing proof that the tide has turned, and that we are entering on a course of new and unforeseen events, we find it in the fact that the <num value="3">three</num> Powers who possess the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> immediately opposite to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> have entered into a convention which binds them to fit out and send a joint expedition for the purpose of demanding from the <rs>Republic</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> more efficacious protection for the persons and properties of their subjects, as well as the fulfillment of all obligations contracted towards them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>We do not expect that the <name>Allies</name> are about to act over again the exploits of Hernan Cortes, for they have no vast and consolidated empire to confront them, and the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> authorities well know that in case of resistance they are but the precursors of a force which would render resistance absurd.--We cannot doubt that the troops of the <num value="3">three</num> nations go to dictate their own terms, and that whatever these terms may be they must of necessity he complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> --It seems impossible to eradicate from the <rs>Northern</rs> mind the prevalent delusion that a majority of the <rs>Southern</rs> people are actually at this time in favor of the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>In considering the question <q>&#x0022;will the <rs>Southern States</rs> return to the <rs>Union</rs>,&#x0022;</q> a writer in the <orgName n="Saint Louis News" type="newspaper">St. Louis <hi rend="italics">News</hi></orgName>, whose opinions seem to be endorsed by that paper, denies that there is unity of sentiment among <q>&#x0022;the rebels&#x0022;</q> on the question of war, and asserts that <q>&#x0022;were this true, the <rs>Government</rs> would best subserve the ends of justice and humanity by making a good treaty with them, and let them go.&#x0022;</q> The writer reasons thus: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> &#x0022;The rebellion is not of the whole people of the <rs>South</rs>, and no doubt if a fair expression of the voice of the entire <rs>South</rs> was taken, there would be a majority in favor of the <rs>Union</rs>; if so, are they not coerced into subjection to the authorities of the &#x0027;<orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, &#x0027; and would it be subjugation to the <rs>South</rs> to let them return to the <rs>Union</rs> if a majority desire it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>In short, is not the <rs>South</rs> already subjugated by designing men who sprung this revolt upon her? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> &#x0026;Taking this view of the case, there can be to such thing as subjugation, but an overthrow of conspirators against a common government, and as the <rs>Federal</rs> arms prevail against these traitors in any State, let the loyal men rise up and say we have conquered, and let them, like the old <rs>North State</rs>, establish a provisional government until such time as they may deem best for an election. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> &#x0022;By so doing, all this talk about the <rs>North</rs> whipping the <rs>South</rs>, <unclear>t ,</unclear> is done away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Nothing has been done but destroy a foul conspiracy against a Government, the best ever known, and in every particular as valuable to the <rs>South</rs> as the <rs>North</rs>; which has ever, and ever will, if allowed to live, prosper and protect all its loyal citizens.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> This is a most lame and impotent conclusion of the gasconading spirit in which this war was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Instead of being subjugated by great standing armies, we are now to be stifled to death by provisional governments, like that of the <rs>Pan Handle</rs> and of <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>For our own part, we care not how many Sancho Panzas the <rs>Northern Quixotto</rs> outhouses on our Islands and pan-handles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>We are about as much pleased with each new appointment of a bogus Southern Governor as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves or the fortunate recipients of their patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Every new leech that is annexed to the <rs>Federal</rs> arteries we look upon as our ally in drawing the monster's life-blood and hastening his death struggle While our Southern soldiers bleed him on the field, the gubernatorial and other blood-suckers will reduce him to such a state of impotence that he will scarce have strength to <q>&#x0022;wipe his weeping eyes&#x0022;</q> We hope that <q>&#x0022;provisional governments&#x0022;</q> will become as numerous as the locus's of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and, as the rebels may seek to disparage and bring them into contempt on account of the narrow field of their operations, there ought to be as much pomp, paraphernalia, and expenditure as possible in the maintenance of their authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Each Governor ought to have a large salary and a splendid suite, an executive palace, and a small standing army, If a provisional government does not provide for the <rs>Governor</rs>, what is it good for? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> As to the delusion that <q>&#x0022;a majority of the <rs>South</rs> are in favor of the <rs>Union</rs>,&#x0022;</q> we know not how it is to be dispelled except by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Tories and traitors there may be among us; men here and there in our most loyal districts, who are ready to act as spies and informers, and, small sections in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, where a traitorous minority are still strong enough to give us trouble, but, with these exceptions, a more united and loyal people than the people of the <rs>South</rs> cannot be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The old Union men have been the foremost in every battle, and are at this moment as implacable enemies to a reconstruction of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> as the most ardent original Secessionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>If the hopes of the <rs>North</rs> are based upon any imaginary fissure in the <rs>Southern</rs> rock it may as well give up its bloody crusade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>There is not a Government on the face of the earth which the great mass of the <rs>Southern</rs> people would not prefer to live and die under than the detested Northern despotism. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It is, in truth, too hard that we should be compelled to defend ourselves against such insinuations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>We never have published anonymous pamphlets predicting the absorption of friendly States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Before it was ordered here, this army had been encamped for a few days near the <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 5" reg="new river, west virginia, west virginia">New river</placeName>, in <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=17">Monroe county</placeName>, at an abandoned watering place, formerly known as the <rs type="place">Gray Sulphur Springs</rs>, a mile or <num value="2">two</num> from Peterstown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The number of vacant buildings at that place; the great quantity of corn raised on the <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 5" reg="new river, west virginia, west virginia">New river</placeName>; the bountiful supply of beef always to be had in the large grazing county of <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=17">Monroe</placeName>; the good battean navigation practicable between that point and the <rs type="place">Central Depot</rs> of the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee Railroad</orgName>, some <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> above, on the river; and the midway position it presented between the <name>Dubin</name> and <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s river Depots, affording protection against the enemy to either point &mdash; all made Peterstown a very favorable <num value="1">one</num> for the establishment of a permanent camp, and depository of provisions. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>When we consider the distances many of them have marched, at least <measure n="400miles" type="distance">four hundred miles</measure> during the season, their present condition must be conceded to reflect great credit upon their officers.
