<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> It was hard on to <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the morning when the battle actually begun, although random shots had been heard for an hour or more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It was very dark and foggy, with every prospect of rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>When daylight came the artillery opened in good earnest, and roared through the woods a spiteful greeting to the foe, while every few moments a rapid fire of musketry rattled along the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Lying upon a small island, our boats hauled up under the tall sedge and grass which fringed the bank, bivouac fires smouldering &mdash; just enough to give us a little warmth, without showing smoke to the enemy &mdash; wearied and worn by nights of hard work and wakefulness, the men lay and slept or listened to the noise of the fight as <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName> drove the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> before him. Nearer and nearer grew the battles until it was abreast of us &mdash; beyond us &mdash; and we heard the guns of the fortifications open upon the victorious advance guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Bachelor's <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, a small, deep, and tortuous stream, runs across the country a few miles above <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName>, and finally empties into the <rs>Neuse</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> from the town the railroad crosses it, while still further on is the <placeName key="tgn,1131021" n="1.000 4" reg="trent, north carolina, united states">Trent</placeName> road, leading towards <placeName key="tgn,2075343" n="1.000 86" reg="kinston, lenoir, north carolina">Kinston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>At this point the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had erected formidable field works, and beside them a strong block-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Here were their reserves, living securely in pleasant encampments, and beyond, pushed out <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>, the advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>So quietly had <persName n="Pickett,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Pickett,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Pickett</surname></persName> managed his troops, the enemy was entirely without knowledge of this approach of any body of men, although the proximity of the pickets told them the <rs>Confederates</rs> were pushing upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Some <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> beyond Bachelor's</placeName> bridge the fight began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Straggling shots were fired about <time value="2am">two in the morning</time>, but <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName> held back until daylight, when he turned loose upon them, and began &#x0022;driving them&#x0022;in <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Retreating into the fortifications across the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, they made a fierce stand, and opened a heavy fire from the block-house and the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>No use, however; for, advancing steadily up to them until within easy distance, <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName> and <persName n="Clingman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Clingman,nomatch:0"><surname>Clingman</surname></persName> carried the forts in fine style, and scattered the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Then came a race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><persName n="Pickett,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pickett</surname></persName> pressed close upon them, and kept them moving towards the railroad, where another reserve had been drawn up to await his approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Here, too, was a railroad battery, which, mounting some heavy guns, had been run out from the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Driving the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> across the embankment, a battery was sent down to engage the iron monster, and in a few moments it was driven back, and the rails torn up to prevent another advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A sharp fight now occurred; but in a short time the enemy was forced to retreat, their line broken, and <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName> had them on the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Following close upon them, pouring the shot into them whenever they endeavored to form, our troops pressed them into a run, and for a few miles they made &#x0022;amazing tracks&#x0022; to get under cover of the guns of the forts built around the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Regiments became disorganized and scattered through the woods, and men and officers, with the shout of &#x0022;<foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">sauve qui pent,</hi></foreign>&#x0022; threw away knapsack and rifle and ran for their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>By <time value="3pm">three in the evening</time> the enemy had taken shelter within the fortifications, and stood awaiting the anticipated attack upon the town; but straggling bands were found scattered through the woods, and were every moment being brought in by our men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> During all this brilliant little affair only <num value="2">two</num> brigades were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><persName n="Barton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Barton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Barton</surname></persName>, with the pick troops of the division, had been sent to the south side of the <rs>Trent</rs>, and his approach was looked for with great anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/><persName n="Pickett,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pickett</surname></persName> listened anxiously for the sound of his guns, expecting every moment to hear him open upon the town in the rear; but the day wore away and nothing was heard from him; evening came on, and still no news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Just across the <rs>Neuse</rs>, hardly <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile from <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName>, was <placeName reg="Sunny Point, Brunswick, North Carolina" key="tgn,2704307">Fort Anderson</placeName>, and this, to prevent the garrison assisting in the fight, and also to keep reinforcements from coming on from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, had been closely invested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><persName n="Dearing,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Dearing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Dearing</surname></persName>, with a brigade of infantry, <num value="3">three</num> battalions of cavalry and <num value="2">two</num> batteries of artillery, had completely surrounded it, and kept the men under arms, expectantly waiting an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>This, however, was almost impossible from the land side; for the place was remarkably strong, the fort <measure n="14feet" type="distance">14 feet</measure> high, mounting <num value="11">11</num> guns of large calibre, with a ditch from <num value="4">4</num> to <measure n="6feet" type="distance">6 feet</measure> deep and <measure n="12feet" type="distance">12 feet</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The garrison, under <persName n="Anderson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, was composed of <num value="860">860</num> infantry, with some <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The most that could be done was to keep this force engaged, and at the same time to threaten the <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> road to prevent reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>This <persName n="Dearing,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Dearing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Dearing</surname></persName> accomplished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> For some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> around <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName> the forest had been cleared, and the guns of <num value="3">three</num> large forts, together with <num value="2">two</num> parks of <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> stationed in the town, had a clear sweep, and would have played havoc with our advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Evidently the attack must come from the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Night was fast coming on; and still no news of <persName n="Barton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Barton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Barton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Just as the sun was sinking behind the tree tops word was brought that the enemy was endeavoring to make a demonstration on the extreme right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/><persName n="Pickett,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pickett</surname></persName> was standing under a tree, in full sight of the town and its fortifications, his staff lying upon the ground around him looking anxiously towards the <rs>Trent</rs>, twirling his sword knot around his small white hand, or, as if in perplexity, fastidiously biting his finger nails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>I knew he was thinking of <persName n="Barton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Barton,nomatch:0"><surname>Barton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Just then rode up the soldier <rs>Hoke</rs>, and, dismounting, explained the movement on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Evidently to feel the force, being securely near the forts, some cavalry, artillery and infantry had advanced, but the cavalry had been easily repulsed by his pickets, and the whole column had halted.--&#x0022;They must be driven back,&#x0022; said <persName n="Pickett,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pickett</surname></persName>; <q>&#x0022;Can you do it?&#x0022;</q> &#x0022;Yes, &#x0022; replied <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>, brightening up, <q>&#x0022;with my own brigade;&#x0022;</q> and vaulting into the saddle he rode away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Half an hour afterwards we heard the humble of artillery towards <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName>, and knew the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were retiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>When the sun set the enemy was confined within their fortifications; but still no news from south of the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/><rs type="role">Gen.</rs> P. looks more perplexed than ever, and twists his sword knot more rapidly, and bites his nails persistently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Presently he disposes of the troops for the night and turns away from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>As he passes the tired soldiers who have fought all day rise to greet him, smiles cover their dusty faces, caps wave, and we know that hearty cheers would follow but for the proximity of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The day's fight was ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Still, as the daylight lingered, small bands of prisoners were brought in, until between <num value="180">180</num> and <num value="200">200</num> had been collected, and the whole put on the route to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Besides the prisoners was some artillery, several wagons, a quantity of stores, together with sundry plies of private baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>And this is all I know about the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>What occurred south of the <rs>Trent</rs> I do not know, and I do not care to speak from hearsay or to draw any inferences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The conduct of <persName n="Pickett,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="nearbymention:Pickett,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pickett</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Clingman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Clingman,nomatch:0"><surname>Clingman</surname></persName>, won my entire admiration, and I think all will concur as far as affairs were pushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The loss was very small on our side.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> When night came, as I said in my previous letter, we made preparations to go again in search of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gunboats, and this time through a reconnaissance in the evening, the position of <num value="1">one</num> was marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The other had gone higher up the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>About <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> we dropped down the stream, and pulled to where the river widened into an estuary just off the town, the lights of which twinkled through the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The stars were shining brightly, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blush of the rising moon began to appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Winding down in <num value="2">two</num> long black lines for another half hour, the boats were again brought alongside for prayers &mdash; instructions were issued, and once more we were on the way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>We were then upwards of <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> away and had to give way strongly for it, to prevent the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> slipping the lines and giving her a turn ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The fight I have spoken of before.--Lasting about <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> only, but in that short time the enemy was overpowered, the decks in our possession, and the prisoners secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>You have won glorious victories over vastly more numerous hosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>You have cheerfully borne privations and toll to which you were unused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>You have readily submitted to restraints upon your individual will, that the citizen might better perform his duty to the <rs>State</rs> as a soldier.--To all these you have lately added another triumph, the noblest of human conquests &mdash; a victory over yourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> As the time drew near when you who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered the service might well have been expected to claim relief from your arduous labors and restoration to the endearments of home, you have heeded only the call of your suffering country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Again you come to tender your service for the public defence &mdash; a free offering which only such patriotism as yours could make &mdash; a triumph worthy of you and of the cause to which you are devoted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> I would in vain attempt adequately to express the emotions with which I received the testimonials of confidence and regard which you have recently addressed to me. To some of those <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> received, separate acknowledgments were returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But it is now apparent that a like generous enthusiasm pervades the whole army, and that the only exception to such magnanimous tender will be of those who, having originally entered for the war, cannot display anew their zeal in the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It is, therefore, deemed appropriate, and it is hoped, will be equally acceptable, to make a general acknowledgment, instead of successive special responses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Would that it were possible to render my thanks to you in person, and in the name of our common country, as well as in my own, while pressing the hand of each war worn veteran, to recognize his title to our love, gratitude, and admiration. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> Soldiers! By your will (for you and the people are but <num value="1">one</num>) I have been placed in a position which debars me from sharing your dangers, your sufferings, and your privations in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>With pride and affection my heart has accompanied you in every march; with solicitude it has sought to minister to your every want; with exultation it has marked your every heroic achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Yet, never in the toilsome march, nor in the weary watch, nor in the desperate assault, have you rendered a service so decisive in results as in this last display of the highest qualities of devotion and self-sacrifice which can adorn the character of the warrior- patriot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> Already the pulse of the whole people beats in unison with yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Already they compare your spontaneous and unanimous offer of your lives, for the defence of your country, with the halting and reluctant service of the mercenaries who are purchased by the enemy at the price of higher bounties than have hitherto been known in war. Animated by this contrast, they exhibit cheerful confidence and more resolute bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Even the murmurs of the weak and limit, who shrink from the trials which make stronger and firmer your noble natures, are shamed into silence by the spectacle which you present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Your brave battle-cry will ring loud and clear through the land of the enemy, as well as our own; will silence the vainglorious boastings of their corrupt partisans and their pensioned press; and will do justice to the calumny by which they seek to persuade a deluded people that you are ready to purchase dishonorable safety by degrading submission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> Soldiers! The coming spring campaign will open under auspices well calculated to sustain your hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Your resolution needed nothing to fortify it. With ranks replenished under the influence of your example, and by the aid of your representatives, who give earnest of their purpose to add, by legislation, largely to your strength, you may welcome the invader with a confidence justified by the memory of past victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>On the other hand, debt, taxation, repetition of heavy drafts, dissensions, occasioned by the strife for power, by the pursuit of the spoils of office, by the thirst for the plunder of the public treasury; and above all, the consciousness of a bad cause, must tell with fearful force upon the over strained energies of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>His campaign in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, must from the exhaustion of his resources both in men and money, be far less formidable than those of the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, when unimpaired means were used with boundless prodigality, and with results which are suggested by the mention of the glorious names of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> and <placeName reg="Perrysville, Ashland, Ohio" key="tgn,2081365">Perrysville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' and <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, and the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>This he found quite a difficult job, for as often as he went to <num value="1">one</num> place, whither he had been directed, he was told that he had just left, and would be found at some other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>He thought him less moved by mercenary considerations than almost any other officer of his rank, and represented him as a man of a disposition naturally, extremely humane and compassionate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Here he was examined with great strictness by the <rs>Marshal</rs> himself, whom he represented as an old man apparently on the verge of dotage, very cunning, and very feeble of body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>He always expressed the belief that his answers to the questions proposed to him during this examination had the effect of misleading <persName n="Kutusoff,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00287" reg="nearbymention:Kutusoff,Prince,,,"><surname>Kutusoff</surname></persName>, and thereby of materially assisting the escape of <persName n="Ney,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00288" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Ney</surname></persName>, with the remnant of his corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>As he approached the <name>Tuilleries</name>, whither his orders led him, he was challenged by a sentinel, who told him he had orders to let no <num value="1">one</num> pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Upon inquiring what was the matter, the reply was &#x0022;the <rs>Emperor</rs> is here.&#x0022; --Utterly amazed, and suspecting that the man was attempting to make him utter some treasonable sentiment, he asked him &#x0022;what is the matter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Is he wounded?&#x0022; &#x0022;No, but he has been badly beaten, and has come to get reinforcements.&#x0022; --Upon returning to camp, and reporting, his superior officer was so incredulous, that he threatened to put him under arrest. </p>
