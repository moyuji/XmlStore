<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>All our dead were carefully buried, and our wounded secured and attended to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> On the morning after the fight our artillery shelled the woods in which the enemy had taken refuge, but there was no response to our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Having attended to our own dead and wounded, and also cared for the wounded of the foe, opportunity was given them to bury their dead, which they did in full view of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The number of their dead must have been large, as several hours were occupied in their burial and removal from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Hearing a sweet voice ask, <q>&#x0022;Are there any sick or wounded soldiers in this car?&#x0022;</q> I looked out, and found several ladies, (many of them quite young,) with servants, bearing the finest fruits and melons, which they were pressing upon all who wore the garb of a soldier, and asking, in the kindest manner, if there were no others who needed their assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>At many places those most conspicuous in these attentions wore the weeds of mourning, and we thought their sympathies for the soldier were probably strengthen by the tear that had been shed for a loved <num value="1">one</num>, whose bones now rested uncoffined on the fields of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, or <placeName key="tgn,1122759" n="1.000 34" reg="chickahominy, virginia">Chickahominy</placeName>.
