<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/> It is good to receive instruction from our enemies, and to follow their example when it is manifestly for our benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Recent reports from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> state that some <num value="50">fifty</num> of our soldiers, captured by the enemy in some skirmish, have been put to work to construct fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>As mere retaliation, there would be ample justification for the measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>But there would also be a great balance of advantage to us, inasmuch as we now have as prisoners fully <num value="5">five</num> of their soldiers for every <num value="1">one</num> of ours which they hold; and the superiority of numbers of paroled prisoners is not less in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>It would be a great saving of money to convert <num value="8000">8,000</num> or more idle and expensive prisoners to profitable laborers, either in our coal mines, or at different mechanical employments in our different States-prisons. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/> &#x0022;We had quite an exciting time down here yesterday, in fact, we have had an engagement with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>I am glad to say that none on our side were hurt &mdash; whether any of the enemy were hurt or not we are unable to say. The following are the particulars: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/> &#x0022;Yesterday evening we saw a steamer coming in very close to our battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>She then turned round and headed off again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>Several of us got into a boat and sailed out a considerable distance to see if we could make her out, but were unable to get near enough to her. She was soon out of night, and no more was thought of her until about <time value="4:30oclock">half-past 4 o'clock</time>, when she was again seen heading into the bar. She continued to approach very close, and at last came to anchor just out of gun-shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Several boats, loaded with men, put off from her and made towards a schooner, which got ashore last Sunday on the breakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The intention of the steamer was evidently to set fire to and destroy the schooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>We were under arms in a very short time, and marched through the woods, covering ourselves behind the sand hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>A detachment was also sent to the battery to man the big guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Just as the boats left the steamer she fired <num value="4">four</num> shots at the schooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>The boats then made towards the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>By this time it had become quite dark, so that our battery had to fire by guess, as it was impossible to see the steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>The boats had cannon aboard of them, and commenced to shell the schooner, thinking that some men were aboard, which, however, was not the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/><persName n="Anderson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,William,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> then ordered us to commence firing our muskets, aiming as we saw the flash of the boats' guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/> &#x0022;Our firing soon had the effect of drawing the fire of the enemy to us. He threw several shell at us, some of which bursted quite near us; <num value="1">one</num> of them burst right into the camp doing no damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>We still kept up our fire upon them, both from the battery and the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>I do not think we did much execution with our muskets, as we had to fire at a very long range, and aim in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>What execution out battery did, we were unable to tell, but supposed it did some, from the fact that the enemy's fire ceased altogether shortly after we opened fire on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>A report was now brought in by the pickets, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had landed on the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>We were then ordered from our cover and made to deploy along the beach, about half a mile, advancing at the same time, anxious looking for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>It was quite dark, and we could see but a short distance ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>We kept a sharp look-out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>We kept our posts about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, in the meantime sending an advanced guard ahead to see if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had really landed; as no men were seen, we concluded that the report was false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>After waiting until near <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> the advance guard was ordered to retire to the main body, when we all formed and marched back to our camp, leaving our pickets doubled.--We arrived at the camp safe and sound--<q> &#x0022;nobody hurt.&#x0022;</q> The <rs>Captain</rs> complimented us upon our behavior, and told us that we had behaved bravely, and that his confidence in us was increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>We were then dismissed, with orders to be on the alert &mdash; to sleep with our guns near us. We all retired to bed, but I do not think there were many who slept soundly, as most of as expected another alarm before morning; there was none, however, and we got up at reveille the same as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>There is no sign of the steamer this morning; they left last night without having accomplished their purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>We were very glad of the result, and it is very gratifying to us to know that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt of Old Abe to make a depredation upon <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> soil was frustrated, and that we had a hand in the affair.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/> I, like yourselves, have never been in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>It will be a novel <unclear></unclear> to as to you. But by inquiry among those who have been and felt it, I have learned something perhaps would be useful and interesting to you. <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> The great object our enemies seem to have in view is to invent some means or to find some plan by which they can kill us without being hurt themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>If we adopt some method to circumvent this single feature of their tactics, they are helpless, and we have them at our mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The sole thing, therefore, necessary is to go up close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>We are told some of the rifles in your hands will kill a man half a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Don't you believe it, it is all stuff.--No gun will kill a man that far, and if they could, no <num value="1">one</num> can hit a man <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> with any certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>You go up within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> or less, and then your marksmanship will tell.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> But their artillery &mdash; their terrible big guns &mdash; we hear they have <num value="200">two hundred</num> of the finest pieces of artillery in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Well, I hope it is true &mdash; we want the guns &mdash; we are entitled to them &mdash; we know how to use them, and they don't &mdash; and <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> never intended that fine cannon, nor any thing else, should be held by those who understood not their use.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/> Another marked feature of the fight, if we get into <num value="1">one</num>, you will find to be the whistling of the shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Our enemies have succeeded admirably in constructing a harmless instrument, which makes a curious and unpleasant noise, and it has this wonderful peculiarity-- it seems to be coming straight at every man who hears it. Now, we know it can't be coming at but <num value="1">one</num> man, or, at most, <num value="2">two</num>; and the truth is, it is coming at nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>You have nothing to do but to pay close attention to your hind sight, and the whistling of the shells will, after a little, become rather a small matter in the grand drama you are acting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The man who hears thunder is never struck by the lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The great implement of death in war you hold in your hands &mdash; the musket and the bayonet &mdash; and your enemies have none better or more terrible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/> Another feature of the fight will be the falling of the killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>It is a trying thing to a man to see his friends fall side by side, and our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse is to carry them to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>But remember, the best way to save your wounded friend is not for <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> to leave the ranks, and thus weaken and break your line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>This will insure his destruction and your own by the trampling and bayonets of your enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Your wounded friends ought to be in the rear, and you ought to be between them and the foe. Now, the plainest and most effectual way to do this, is to close up your ranks and advance on the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>Headquarters were established in a dilapidated old log-pen; the weary troops threw themselves at fall length on the ground with their feet towards the great clambering red fires and slept while the sentinels dragged their aching limbs along their bests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>It was curious to see officers whose soft limbs had been wont to press beds of down, throw themselves down on the bare earth, and go cheerfully to sleep.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/> At <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> in the morning a messenger arrived from <persName n="Rousseau,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="mostcommon:Rousseau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rousseau</surname></persName>, with intelligence for <persName n="Buckley,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="mostcommon:Buckley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Buckley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The long roll was quickly beaten, and in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> the entire regiment were under arms and on the march.--The full round moon was now rising in the very middle of a cloudless sky, and silvering the russet and golden leaves of autumn; the keen <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> wind whistled about our ears; the long, dark column, with gleaming bayonets, moved on with silent and majestic step, through shadow and moonlight, to find the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Thinking it highly probable, from the tenor of the message sent back, that the cavalry would become engaged before the infantry could come up, and not wishing to miss the sight, I put spurs to my horse, and went dashing away to overtake them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>And now I saw sights which indicated that fact which it seems so hard for <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> to realize &mdash; that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is, indeed, the theatre of war. From the dark arms to right and left innumerable rockets were ascending to warn the enemy of our approach.-- Many of the farm-houses along the road were deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Most of these were the houses of Secessionists, who have fled on the approach of our army, but many of them belonged to loyal citizens, and their smashed and shattered windows, broken fences, and general desolation, bespoke in some measure, the bitter hatred and vindictive spirit which enters into the <rs>Southern</rs> side of this mighty contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>At some places whole families had left their beds and crowded down to the road to see the troops when they should pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/><num value="1">One</num> of these groups were actually weeping tears of joy, and blessing <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the approach of the <rs>Union</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>I passed the house where, a few days ago, a detachment from the <orgName type="regiment" key="IN39">Thirty-ninth Indiana</orgName> had a little skirmish with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>It is a great, old, double log house, <num value="2">two</num> stories high, standing near the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/><num value="3">Three</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> beyond it is a swell in the road flanked by a thicket of red-oak bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The rebels took cover in this thicket, and blazed away at our men in the house, disabling a water-bucket that set in the passage between the <num value="2">two</num> piles of logs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Our fellows replied with bitter effect, shooting <num value="1">one</num> rebel in the shoulder, but not seriously enough to prevent his mounting his horse and scampering away with the rest of his party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>I received a full description of the whole affair, as I came back, from the man who lives at the next farm-house below, and who witnessed it all. After galloping about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> from the place where I left the infantry, I met a horsemen goading along a lame and let-down cavalry horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>The poor fellow was scared almost out of his wits, expecting every minute to be gobbled up by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>He said <persName n="Rousseau,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="mostcommon:Rousseau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rousseau</surname></persName> had sent him back to fetch the horse, and to tell Col.. <persName n="Buckley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00313" reg="mostcommon:Buckley,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckley</surname></persName> he needn't march the men any further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>He said he believed the enemy were about to take the <rs>General</rs> and the cavalry prisoners, for he had gone dashing on towards <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green river</placeName> like a wild man, and he believed the <rs>General</rs> had sent him back to stop <persName n="Buckley,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00314" reg="mostcommon:Buckley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Buckley</surname></persName> to keep the rebels from getting him, too. I told him I looked upon the matter in a somewhat different light, so far as the <rs>General</rs> and the army were concerned; but that, as for himself, I had not eloquence to convince him that the rebels would not catch him and kill him long enough before he got back to the <name>Legion</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>In reply to my question where the <rs>General</rs> and cavalry were, he pointed away towards the <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green river</placeName> hills, which were visible in the distance, swelling up through a shroud of fog into the clear white moonlight, and said <q>&#x0022;Off over thar', somewhar; <name n="God" type="God">God</name> only knows whar.&#x0022;</q> Bidding him good night, I galloped on, knowing that my only chance of seeing the fun, if there was to be any, depended upon overtaking the cavalry very soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>A ride of a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> brought me to the celebrated <persName n="Bacon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00315" reg="mostcommon:Bacon,nomatch:0"><surname>Bacon</surname></persName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> Bridge, of which the readers of the <hi rend="italics">Times.</hi> have all heard., This is <num value="1">one</num> of the railroad bridges which the rebels burned; but it is somewhat remarkable that they did not destroy the abutments, although they have had an abundance of time and every opportunity to do so. Riding up out of the woods that fringe the stream, and emerging into open fields again just at a railway station, I saw a man skulking around through the shadows of the buildings, as if anxious to observe everything that passed without being seen himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Keen for an item, I rode up the embankment, and hailed him. Seeing that he was discovered, he came forward, and then commenced some rather sharp practice in the way of cross-quizzing, each party being anxious to find out to which side the other belonged, without avowing himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>I inquired whether he had seen any horsemen pass since dark; but he professed blank ignorance on the subject, seemed greatly astonished that any horseman should pass along there at all, and, in fact, appeared to be skeptical as to the existence of such an animal as the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>It was evident how the matter stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>He was a Union man, who thought I might be a rebel, and did not want to give me any information which would let me out of the trap into which he thought I had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Pretty soon the inspiring note of the bugle was heard off among the <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green river</placeName> hills, and presently the cavalry came rushing back, the tall form of the <rs>General</rs> towering magnificently in the brilliant moon-light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>He had been disappointed in his hope of surprising the rebel pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>They had knowledge of his approach, and had fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>We stopped at <persName n="Bacon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00316" reg="mostcommon:Bacon,nomatch:0"><surname>Bacon</surname></persName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> till daylight, then took a soldier's breakfast and returned to camp, having made a march of nearly <measure n="40miles" type="distance">40 miles</measure>. A man who has just come in from Sassafrasville tells me there was tell scrambling among the rebels at that place when news of our advance came.--There were only some <num value="40">forty</num> of them in the town, but these and their pickets were placed in boats and quietly ferried to the <rs>Southern</rs> shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>They believed the whole army was advancing against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>As to the marauding parties that we wanted to catch, they had all crossed over the river a few days before, and so saved their bacon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/><persName n="Rousseau,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00317" reg="mostcommon:Rousseau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rousseau</surname></persName> penetrated almost to the bank of <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green river</placeName>, as far as he could go without exposing his men to the rebel batteries on the further bluff. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/> I acquired considerable information both curious and valuable by the trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The farmers who live along the road are pretty well posted as to motions and things in the rebel camp, but as to their numbers, they either know nothing, or will tell nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>It is <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> probable they are honestly ignorant on that point; but they pick up a great many incidents and anecdotes from the rebel scouts, which are not only instructive but very interesting to those who are personally acquainted with the rebel leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>For instance, <persName n="Marshall,,Humphrey,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00318" reg="default:Marshall,Humphrey,,,"><foreName>Humphrey</foreName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName> escaped into the rebel camp by disguising himself as an honest old farmer, dressed in his own home- made-jeans, and driving a couple of cows before him. <persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00319" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName> raved and cursed like maniac on learning that his silly coadjutors at <placeName reg="Elizabethtown, Hardin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038674">Elizabethtown</placeName> were burning the bridges and destroying the track on the memorable night of <date value="09-17">Sept. 17.</date> He had no idea of stopping short of <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>; he had men enough to crush <persName n="Rousseau,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00320" reg="mostcommon:Rousseau,nomatch:0"><surname>Rousseau</surname></persName> and his handful of raw recruits, and when he heard that the blockheads on whom he relied for stealing the trains to transport his men were actually defeating his darling scheme, his rage is described as fearful to behold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/> The Unionism of the professed Loyalists in these parts, is certainly a very curious sort of affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glance the whole country seems to be enthusiastic in its devotion to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/><num value="1">One</num> reason for this seeming unanimity is the fact that all who were Secessionists in the late political campaign, have fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>But of those who remain, I am satisfied that fully <num value="0.5">one-half</num> are at heart Secessionists, though they are all very loud in their professions of loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>A good many recruits are coming in, all things considered; but I have noticed that the recruiting ground, which is to do such wonders, always keeps its distance, advancing as we advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>When we were at <placeName reg="Muldraugh's Hill, Kentucky, Kentucky" key="tgn,2531285">Muldraugh's Hill</placeName>, it was here; now it is in the next county below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Still, I suppose it is all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Our Union papers insist that it is, and the <rs>North</rs> believes them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>However, there is <num value="1">one</num> trifling fact which is unpleasant to contemplate and rather inconvenient in its results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The greatest pains have been taken to exclude from the camp all except the most tried and undoubted <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>No other class can get within the lines, which embrace a considerable extent of country, upon any pretext whatever, no matter what.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Yet the enemy are kept thoroughly posted as to everything that takes place here; and sometimes we find them in possession of facts which it is surprising that they should obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The painful truth is, that the public mind is resolved not to see this great rebellion in its true light, and will hear of nothing but what chimes with its humor. </p>
