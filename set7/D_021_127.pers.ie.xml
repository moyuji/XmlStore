<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He figures up and multiplies by twice or thrice the commerce of the lakes, and points significantly to the number of members, and the votes of the <rs>Northwest</rs> in the <orgName n="Electoral College" type="college">Electoral College</orgName>, very much as the beggar in <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Gil,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Gil,nomatch:0"><surname>Gil</surname></persName>-Blas&#x0022;</q> pointed the barrel of the musket with which he strengthened his demand for arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>This precious piece of log-rolling is so transparently absurd that no <num value="1">one</num> can be taken in by it, and its only importance is as a confession of the weakness of the cause that asks such support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The only parallel is to be found in the argument of <persName n="Arnold,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>, that if such a canal as he proposes had been in existence, the <q>&#x0022;<num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> sailors now shut up on the <rs type="place">Lakes</rs> would have been at the disposal of the <rs>Government</rs>&#x0022;</q>--overlooking the fact that if patriotism and railroads have not carried them to <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> and to the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>, a ship canal would hardly have done so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>We have built our railroads and canals without help from the <name>Treasury</name>, while our public lands have been lavished upon every railroad scheme that speculators could bolster up in the neighborhood of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>During our recent exuberant prosperity we have borne this without grumbling, but the limit of endurance is reached when a new and illimitable programme of plunder in hard cash is opened before us, at a time when the <name>Treasury</name> is empty, the national credit strained to the utmost for the prosecution of the war, our sources of prosperity cut off, and a fearful certainly of taxation rising blackly before us. Add to this, that the object put forward in justification is transparently false, and that the real end to be procured will be the destruction of our business, and we realize the proportions of an outrage as great as ever was threatened towards a free community. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>He found himself in an embarrassing position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Many things should be said which, as an officer of the <rs>Government</rs>, he could not say at this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> He proposed when he became a citizen, to address the citizens of <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> on matters of more interest than he could touch upon now. He had always aimed to obey orders, and had walked by the rules and regulations of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can say otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>He did not know the cause of his arrest, but knew that the strange and unwarrantable course pursued was dictated by political hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>[Groans for <persName n="Sturgis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Sturgis,nomatch:0"><surname>Sturgis</surname></persName>.] In his present position he could not speak of those who were, unfortunately, his superiors, but the time would come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>[Cheers.] He had resigned his position, because, as a <persName n="Kansas,,Free-State,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="default:Kansas,Free-State,,,"><foreName>Free-State</foreName> <surname>Kansas</surname></persName> man, he could not serve under the men who had led the oppressive Border-Ruffian raids in that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>For weeks, aye months in those days, he had not been able to enter his own home, because of the <rs>General</rs> now sent to command this <orgName n="District of Kansas" type="district">District of Kansas</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Her people are jealous of such men. They have a right to be.-- He had <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> reminders of that jealousy in the shape of bullets and buck-shot now in his body, and while carrying so much lead, was not likely to forget the cause or the man engaged in it. [Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> He believed that the proceedings against him had been caused by the fact that he was an Abolitionist, [Cheers,] It was true, he was an Abolitionist, but being confined in the <address><street n="5 Street">Fifth street</street></address> <placeName reg="Military Prison">Military Prison</placeName> was not likely to make him any less so. He trusted that when he ceased to be an Abolitionist he might cease to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>[Cheers.] But in this war for the <rs>Union</rs> he never had known pro or anti-slavery men. His own views were convictions which had grown out of his life, and could not be otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>But some of the best Union men he had known were pro-slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>He had, during the past winter, under command of <persName n="Oliver,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Oliver,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Oliver</surname></persName>, <num value="3">three</num> companies of the <orgName type="regiment" n="MO7">Missouri Seventh</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>These very men, under <persName n="Frost,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Frost,nomatch:0"><surname>Frost</surname></persName>, had pursued him but the year before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>They hated to come under his command, but after weeks of campaigning they parted from him with regret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>As men we differed on the subject of slavery, but as soldiers we stood side by side for the <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>He had been accused of every conceivable crime by the <orgName n="Missouri Republican" type="newspaper">Missouri <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi></orgName>, and branded as a murderer, thief, and outlaw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>He had but to say, that no Union man could come forward and say knowingly he or his property had been injured by him. He challenged investigation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> For these malignant slanders, he branded their authors as cowardly and contemptible liars and scoundrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>[Cheers] He had not even obeyed fully the orders he received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Had he done so, <placeName reg="Pleasant Hill, Cass, Missouri" key="tgn,2060118">Pleasant Hill</placeName>, Independence, <placeName reg="Kansas City, Jackson, Missouri" key="tgn,7013820">Kansas City</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Kansas City, Jackson, Missouri" key="tgn,7013820">Westport</placeName>, would have been in ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>If these acts were criminal, then his superior officers were to be charged, not himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>We were fighting not an organized force, but a sneaking crowd of murderers, who did not dare to meet them in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>He offered to fight Up. Hays, with equal numbers, at any time, but he refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>What was left?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Why, we burnt them out. Was it not right? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> The <rs>Colonel</rs> then gave a rapid sketch of his campaign in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Missouri</placeName>, which justified his course, and demanding an investigation and justice at the hands of his defamers, he then alluded to the instigators of his arrest, stating that he had just received letters from them, in which they backed down, and declared that <persName n="Sturgis,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Sturgis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sturgis</surname></persName> would release him immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>All he had to say in relation to this crawfishing was, that if he had felt embittered toward them as traitors, now he despised them as cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>His father had always taught him never to quarrel, but ye remember that both <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man hated a coward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>He had remembered it, as probably the history of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Kansas</placeName> will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>In '<num value="57">57</num> he was ordered to leave by the pro-slavery hounds. --He was told it was because he was a free State man, and that section was intended to be slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He then told them that he had a <persName n="Sharpe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Sharpe,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharpe</surname></persName>'s rifle and <num value="2">two</num> revolvers, and he proposed to <q>&#x0022;paddle his own canoe.&#x0022;</q> <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> tells who had succeeded in clearing the rapids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>[Enthusiastic cheers.] In conclusion, the <rs>Colonel</rs> paid an eloquent tribute to the <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, whose valor, patriotism, and devotion to liberty, had undoubtedly saved the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>He paid a tribute to <persName n="Siegel,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Siegel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Siegel</surname></persName>, and in closing stated that with the <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, he would always be found a lover of liberty, that all men might recognize in <persName n="Jennison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Jennison,nomatch:0"><surname>Jennison</surname></persName> the <name>Jayhawker</name>, while a faithful soldier of the <rs>Union</rs>, and undoubted, undisguised, fighting Abolitionist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> He was greeted with loud cheers, and after music from the band, the assemblage dispersed. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> Happily for us and our children, and for the cause of humanity, we are now separated forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>No matter what the diversity of sentiment among us a few months ago, now every patriot rejoices that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is no longer united with a people whose madness or fanaticism has sustained a Government which has trampled under foot every principle of liberty, while it has distinguished itself by unparalleled perfidy and hypocrisy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The most violent enemy of the <rs>North</rs> never dreamed it possible that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his advisers were capable of such startling meanness, outrage, and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Let us rejoice that we are no longer of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>In no age &mdash; in no nation, was there ever a more obnoxious despotism than the <rs>Government</rs> called the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>At this day <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> can appoint whom he please a commanding officer, and that officer may establish such rules and regulations us he please &mdash; suspend the laws, writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> and all, as he please, take up and throw in prison whom he please, and refuse to tell friends, lawyers, officers, and courts, for what or where he has incarcerated him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> And this enormous oppression is mystified because it is alleged that we are rebels and that all over the country there are persons who sympathize with us. Every print in the <rs>North</rs> which had the boldness to question the propriety of the war waged against us, and to advise peace, has been hushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Every man, who has had the spirit to raise his voice against their acts of tyranny and oppression, has been incarcerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>In down trodden <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> the representatives of the people, who had not opened their months, are seized and thrown into prison for fear they would advise.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> And all this, not because the victims of their inhumanity plotted or desired the overthrow of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but because they condemned or opposed, or were supposed to condemn and oppose, the war waged against the <rs>Southern</rs> people.--The rulers at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, having determined on our destruction, have hunted down and imprisoned as felons every man who dared intimate that war upon us was unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>There was no disloyalty to the <rs>North</rs>--the offence has consisted in desiring justice for the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> In comparison with such tyranny the <rs>Spanish Inquisition</rs> was tolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Religious fanaticism could be pleaded as some excuse for the <num value="1">one</num>, while the tyrants at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> cannot offer in extenuation of their barbarities a true purpose to serve either <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of man. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Yet his loyalty to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was not questioned.--<placeName reg="Chatham, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013586">Chatham</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s matchless orator, for more than <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> opposed the arbitrary meanness adopted towards the <rs>Colonels</rs>, and urged their abandonment, and openly declared, after the declaration of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Independence, that the conquest of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> was impossible; and his last great effort in Parliament &mdash; the theatre of his glory &mdash; was an attack on the unjust and impolitic proceedings of the <name>Ministry</name> towards the <name>Colonies</name>, at the close of which he fainted and fell backwards, and in a short time thereafter, breathed his last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>So that it may be said he died battling for the <name>Colonies</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Yet his country men never doubted his loyalty, but honored him with a public funeral, and magnificent monuments were erected to his memory in <persName n="Abbey,,Westminster,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="default:Abbey,Westminster,,,"><foreName>Westminster</foreName> <surname>Abbey</surname></persName> and <persName n="Guild,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Guild,nomatch:0"><surname>Guild</surname></persName> hall. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> Our enemies, however, regard all who will not declare fore subjection right and proper <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> disloyal, and hope to crush opposition by their incarceration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>But how vain must such efforts proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>As long as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gives men a love of freedom and stout hearts there will be rebels against tyranny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>We have protested before the world that all we asked was to be <q>&#x0022;let alone,&#x0022;</q> We have deprecated war as a great calamity, and declared our readiness to agree upon fair terms of separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Our desire for peace has been construed into timidity, and our propositions have been answered with insult and threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>They tell us we are traitors &mdash; that they have the power, and will reduce us to obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>To the <rs>Union</rs> they say we own an <sic>indisacluble</sic> allegiance, and substantially, that they will make us. Union driving men by invading our country, burning down our houses, turning loose our slaves, insulting our women, and murdering our men. And it is with such a people that we are now at war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>It is not strange that in such a contest our soldiers should perform deeds of almost marvellous heroism, and that our enemies should be seized with panic and flee the battle-field in the wildest disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>None but wicked rulers wage such a war. None but misguided soldiers volunteer to fight in such battles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> I mourn with you, sentiment, that in this unhappy struggle gallant officers and brave men have fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>It could have been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Had we consented to be slaves, and to serve our masters all the days of our lives, we would have been <q>&#x0022;let alone&#x0022;</q>--that is, no armies would have been sent among us, except the army of tax gatherers to <q>&#x0022;eat out substance&#x0022;</q> Still, while we mourn our dead, let us thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that thus far He has given us the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Liberty is the child of oppression, and has ever been baptized in the blood of the brave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> These reflections have been suggested by the stirring events which have transpired since the last session of this Court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>We have formed new relations, and hence new duties have arisen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Treason against this Commonwealth no <num value="1">one</num> thought of <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago. Now there is treason, open and avowed; and a portion of the people in the <rs>Western</rs> part of the <rs>State</rs>, counseled and advised of the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and in plain violation of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, have attempted to set up a separate Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Treason against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will fall within the jurisdiction of the <rs>Courts</rs> of that Government; but it is your duty to inquire whether there be in your midst any who are traitors to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>I refer you on this subject to the <name>Code</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, on, <num value="199">199</num>, <ref n="page 783">page 783</ref>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> It is also my duty, gentlemen of the <rs>Grand Jury</rs>, to call your attention to all violations of the criminal laws of this Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Most of you are familiar with the duties you have to perform, and I shall not stop to give you these laws in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It is our duty to execute these laws as they are written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>We have no authority to Inquire whether they are wise or not. We are public servants, and have no authority to grant pardon or immunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Law would be a mere mockery if Judges and jurors were at liberty to execute it or not as they pleased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> I beg you, gentlemen, also to recollect that in time of war, tumult and confusion, as well as in times of peace, the only sure bulwark of liberty is law honestly and faithfully administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>In such times, above all others, it is the duty not only of courts and juries, but of all good men, to frown down all violence and wrong. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> In this day and generation the law is too slow for many people, but reassured every act of wrong and aggression suffered or permitted, inflicts a serious injury upon society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>You may not see it at the moment, but the seed has been sown, and will surely bear fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Educate a people to hold the law in light esteem &mdash; to think that they may take it into their own hands, and you must, in the end, have anarchy, confusion and misery.-- As I have heretofore said, there is no order without law &mdash; there is no liberty without order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> The foregoing part or this charge was prepared last fall and delivered at several of my fall courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Since then our arms have met with sad reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Many a noble spirit has sealed his devotion to his country with his blood, and many brave soldiers have been incarcerated as prisoners of war. But these reverses, so far from leading the patriot to despair, will only induce greater determination and higher resolves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>He is unworthy of the name of patriot who is loud and vociferous in his protestations of devotion to country while all is prosperous and peaceful, and yet quails and trembles in the day of adversity and the hour of peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>As much claim has be to be regarded a friend who is prodigal and pressing in his officers of kindness, while you are independent and above the frowns of the world, and yet when misfortune and calamity overtake you and cast their dark shadows along your pathway, turns away, without even raising a hand to help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>That man, who now counts the value of property, or calculates the danger of battle, has no love of country; no conception of the true value of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It is surely a sad thing to live in a day of revolution, but the brave soul indulges in no unnecessary repining, but renews his enemies, buckles on his armor, and marches forth as a man to meet the foes of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>He feels that he is in the line of duty, and that no sacrifice is too great in the cause of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>He battle is not only for his own rights, but recollects that the chains prepared for him will also be used to bind his children and his children's children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> I have spoken in no featured terms, yet I have not dealt in language of exaggeration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Witness the preparations now being made for our slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>In the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> measures are proposed by which every man who has aided in the defence of the <rs>South</rs> is to have his slaves let loose and freed, and his lands sold or parcelled out among our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Let every true man, therefore, utter but <num value="1">one</num> sentiment, <q>&#x0022;Victory or Death.&#x0022;</q> We must conquer in this contest or become <q>&#x0022;hewers of wood or drawers of water.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> I offer you, gentlemen, no apology for the character of this charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Our allegiance is due to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and no facts or arguments are out of place which tend to show the justice of our cause, and the oppression and tyranny of our enemies &mdash; especially at a time when they stand almost at the gate of our city, with arms in their hands, for the purpose of our destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>In the casualties of war they may come among us as conquerors--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid such humiliation &mdash; but if they should, every <num value="1">one</num> who claims to be a man should recollect where his allegiance is due, and be ready to act as a brave man and determined patriot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>No man who believes our cause just can ever swear allegiance to the <rs>Lincoln</rs> government without committing sin in the sight of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and bringing upon himself a disgrace which no time can wipe away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The memory of such a man can never be revered, even by his own offspring. </p> </div4> </div3>
