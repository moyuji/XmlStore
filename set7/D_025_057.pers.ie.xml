<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --&#x0022;History,&#x0022; says <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bolingbroke</foreName></persName>, &#x0022;is philosophy teaching by example.&#x0022; Unfortunately, few men are philosophers, and still fewer will be taught wisdom by example, or by anything else short of actual experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is the duty, nevertheless, of all independent journalists, when the country is in a crisis to refresh the memories of statesmen, or at least the mass, whose united thoughts constitute what is called public opinion, by presenting parallel examples drawn from the pages of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In other words, it is their duty to point out the beacon, and leave it to others to heed the warning, or to carry the ship among the breakers, as may best suit their ideas of expediency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> We shall endeavor in this article to give a short history of the rise, progress, and catastrophe of the paper issued by the several revolutionary Governments of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, between the years <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct>, as illustrating more completely than any other event in history the dangers of an inflated currency, and the absolute necessity of finding some means to reduce the volume when it has become thus inflated, under pain of absolute and irretrievable national bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><num value="3">Three</num> most important papers have been lately published by officers high in the favor of the <rs>Government</rs> and the estimation of the country, upon the subject of our financial condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>We allude of course to the letters of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Memminger,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> to <persName n="Hunter,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, and the statement of <persName n="Tyler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Tyler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>, Register of the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Memminger,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> tells <persName n="Hunter,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> that <measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">$150,000,000</measure> currency is as much as the whole Confederacy on both sides of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> <hi rend="italics">can bear,</hi> (not as much as it <hi rend="italics">requires,</hi> observe, but as much as it can stand up under;) that he has set that sam afloat in the countries west of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, (that is, he has given them a currency whose volume is equal to the capacity of endurance possessed by the whole Confederacy;) that on this side of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> the currency is <measure n="392000000dollars" type="currency">$392,000,000</measure> and a fraction, being double as much as the whole Confederacy, including the <name>States</name> west of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> is capable of enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The whole currency on both sides of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> he therefore estimates at <measure n="452000000dollars" type="currency">$452,000,000</measure>. <persName n="Tyler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Tyler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName> makes a larger estimate than <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Memminger,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>, stating the amount of Treasury notes heretofore issued at <measure n="624000000dollars" type="currency">$624,000,000</measure>, and the outstanding circulation at <measure n="497000000dollars" type="currency">$497,000,000</measure>, after deducting <measure n="126000000dollars" type="currency">$126,000,000</measure>, which have been funded, and about a <num value="1000000">million</num> more which have been cancelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This discrepancy has no bearing whatever upon our purpose, which is to show, from the example of another country, what must be the consequence if some means, more stringent than any which have yet been applied, be not adopted to retire the superfluous portion of this enormous circulation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The debt of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> was about <num value="3">three</num> milliards of francs, or about <measure n="600000000dollars" type="currency">$600,000,000</measure>. The deplorable state of the finances, and the inability of the <rs>Government</rs> to pay the interest of this debt occasioned the assembling of the <rs>Tiers Etta</rs>, and the meeting of that body, was the commencement of the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In <date value="1790-04">April, 1790,</date> the <rs>Government</rs> so far from having extinguished any of the debt, had increased it by <num value="1250000000">1,250,000,000</num> francs; that is, about <measure n="250000000dollars" type="currency">$250,000,000</measure>. In casting about for means, <persName n="Talleyrand,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Talleyrand,nomatch:0"><surname>Talleyrand</surname></persName>, himself a renegade priest, proposed to take into possession the property of the church, which constituted nearly half the <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> of the kingdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In spite of violent opposition this measure was carried, --the immediate sale of church property to the amount of <num value="400000000">400,000,000</num> francs, or <measure n="80000000dollars" type="currency">$80,000,000</measure>, was ordered for the benefit of the <rs>State</rs>--and the further conduct of the affair turned over to the municipalities, who had become the purchasers in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Not doubting that they should be able to meet their engagements by means of secondary sale, the municipality of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> issued promissory notes to a large amount, and all the other municipalities followed their example, so that the whole amount of the notes thus issued soon reached the value of the whole amount of property confiscated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>When the secondary sales took place, they were entirely disappointed in the results, and the <rs>Government</rs> took the burden off their shoulders by issuing its own promissory notes, and with them taking up the notes of the municipalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Such was the origin of the <name>Assignats</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bore an interest of <num value="0.04">four per cent.</num>, but in subsequent issues lost that feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>For a short time, they passed at par with coin; but the <rs>Convention</rs>, which by this time had succeeded to the power of its predecessors, the <name>Constituent</name> and National Assemblies, finding it impossible to raise the requisite sums by the sales of church property, issued fresh batches, which caused an immediate depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Commodities, of course, rose with the depreciation of the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Labor, which could before the revolution be procured for a single franc, now cost <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The farmers, of course, charged <num value="10">ten</num> times as much for their products, and the butchers and bakers rose in proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This caused a furious commotion in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, the people attributing to speculators and forestallers the natural and inevitable consequences of a depreciated currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>To remedy the evil the <rs>Convention</rs> passed a law that the butchers and bakers should sell at the old prices &mdash; that is, should sell their commodities at the same rate that they were sold when they had to give only <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the existing prices for them in their original state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Of course these unfortunate men, seeing that they must be inevitably ruined, would have shut up shop if they could; but the <rs>Convention</rs> were beforehand with them, and made it a capital offence for them to discontinue business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At the same time they fixed a <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi> upon all the products of the earth, and prescribed the guillotine as the punishment for any <num value="1">one</num> who should sell an assignat for less than its nominal value in coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In the meantime the <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing-press</rs> kept at work night and day. During the <name>Reign</name> of Terror, which lasted but <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure>, paper of the nominal value of <num value="7">seven</num> milliards and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of francs (<measure n="1500000000dollars" type="currency">$1,500,000,000</measure>) was issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The farmers were all ruined by the maximum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Every man was afraid of the paper money, and as fast as he accumulated it passed it to the <rs>Government</rs>, and took <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> in exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In this way half the landed property of the kingdom changed <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>By the time of the overthrow of Robespierre, the currency had fallen so low that <persName n="Pichegru,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Pichegru,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pichegru</surname></persName> commuted his pay, which was nominally <num value="4000">4,000</num> francs, or <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> a month, for <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">$40</measure>; and <persName n="Hoche,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hoche,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoche</surname></persName>, at the head of an army of <num value="100000">100,000</num> men, wrote to the <name>Directory</name> to beg that they would send him a horse, for he had none, and could not buy <num value="1">one</num> with the paper money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>At last, in <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct>, when the public debt had reached <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> of francs, or about <measure n="10000000000dollars" type="currency">$10,000,000,000</measure> a decree of national bankruptcy was passed &mdash; that is to say, the whole debt was repudiated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> We have taken the pains to write this short sketch for the sake of the example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The great mistake of the <rs>French</rs> financiers consisted in having devised no means to retire their enormous issues.--Once out, they could not be redeemed, save by the sale of the public domain, which was soon found to be totally inadequate to the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing press</rs>, once set to going, could never be stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We trust that some means, more effectual than any yet tried, may be devised to stop any further issues, and to bring in the greater part of the outstanding notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Otherwise we see, from the example of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, what we may expect. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> --The <name>French</name> occupation of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and its conversion into an empire, under the patronage and protection of the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, is the bitterest pill, next to the secession of the <rs>South</rs>, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has ever been compelled to swallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It treats with such profound contempt the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine, and all other cardinal doctrines of <persName n="Destiny,,Manifest,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Destiny,Manifest,,,"><foreName>Manifest</foreName> <surname>Destiny</surname></persName>, and it opposes such an effectual barrier to the ambitious plans, purposes, and territorial and political progress of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle, that it may well stir up the bile of that interesting nation to the profoundest depths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The virtuous and honest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Washington Government had long ago determined to absorb <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and annex <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, as well as the various other island waifs of the <rs>Western Archipelago</rs>, which were no doubt at <num value="1">one</num> time portions of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Continent, and consequently ought to be reclaimed.--These beautiful projects, are summarily knocked in the head by the <rs>French</rs> occupation of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The question now arises, what are the U. S. going to do about it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They must either make war upon <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, which they swear they will as soon as they have whipped the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, or they must back down, as they know how to do better than any other nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It will never do, even could they conquer the <rs>South</rs>, to have <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> on the <rs>Southern</rs> border, for the disaffected Southern population would inevitably be affording every facility to their <name>French</name> neighbor to extend his territory from the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> to the <rs>Potomac</rs>.
