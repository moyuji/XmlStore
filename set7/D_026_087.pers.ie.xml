<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The fair lecturer was received most enthusiastically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>After the applause had subsided she spoke in substance as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> She said that she had studied politics; she had been forced to grapple with these unwomanly matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It had been her misfortune to have an equal number of dear friends engaged on both sides of this unnatural shedding of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>She had weighed the argument with the same tender regard a man does when he has to decide between <num value="2">two</num> valued friends who are in a dissipate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>No matter which side wine, the angel of death sits triumphant on the banners of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>[Applause.] The tread of our armies is not only upon the graves of brave men, but also upon the hearts of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>[Tremendous applause.] We are throwing down the monuments of our fathers' labors and creating the despotism of the Old World on the ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>[Applause and cheers.] Her heart had been outraged by the daily reports of blood shed which come from the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>She would never have forced her opinions upon the public if it had not been for a lecture delivered by a young lady in <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName> [Meaning <persName n="Dickenson,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="nearbymention:Dickenson,Anna,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dickenson</surname></persName>.] --The lecture of that lady has endeavored to weave around the horrors of the war a romance, instead of painting the bloody scenes in their true colors [Applause] </p> </q><bibl n="The Brooklyn (N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> The office of all war is to slay all youth and innocence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Whatever may be the crimes of the politicians on both sides there is no eye that does not weep for the private soldiers who are the innocent victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>These soldiers who share none of the blame of the war must endure the hardships and lay down theirselves on the attar of other men's ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>[Repeated rounds of applause.] Was our country so old as to require regeneration?--Must we confess the failure of the <rs>Government</rs> which the good men of the <name>Revolution</name> established upon their blood and graves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>She could not understand why the nation should have a new birth of freedom.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> The eloquent lady then proceeded to paint a glaring picture of the revolution, and returning to the present era of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> history said that there were some people in this country who considered the negro all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The worshiping of <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snakes</rs> by the negroes of Hayti is just as common as among the natives of <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242"><rs type="direction">Central</rs> Africa</placeName>, and these are the gods which emancipation has reared up in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, [applause,] and seek to set up in this country--[Cheers] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> the lecturer showed that emancipation had ruined the prosperity of the fertile <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West India Islands</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The result of total emancipation in this country would be the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The negro can only be a happy and useful being when he is subservient to the white race [Applause.] Slavery is the normal condition of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>[Cheers.] Negroes are in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> what greenbacks are in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>[Applause] They are a legal tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>[Cheers.] They never were intended for anything else--[Continued applause.] When the influence of the white man is withdrawn from them, they soon return to the worshiping of <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snakes</rs> and other such gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>They sink to barbarism, and will do it in spite of all proclamations that may be issued by any man. [Cheers.] And yet we have been told that this war to free the negroes is a sublimer sight than the war of the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The idea that established this Government was white and not black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>[The cheering that this sentiment elicited was perfectly deafening] She quoted <persName n="Douglas,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>'s statement that this nation was founded by white men, for white men only, and their posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> A captain of a <orgName n="Mississippi company" type="company">Mississippi company</orgName> in the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">army of Tennessee</orgName>, writing to the <rs>Atlanta</rs> <hi rend="italics">Register,</hi> throws out some excellent suggestions on this important matter, which we hope will go the rounds of the press: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> I have tried to write an article and have failed; now I ask you to write it and insert it in your valuable paper, and sign it as coming from a company commander of the above brigade, asking the cooperation of all the company commanders of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">army of Tennessee</orgName> on the following points: Teaching the men in battle to aim their pieces with more accuracy, and the great importance of being cool and collected, and wait until the enemy are within easy range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Exhort them all to act together in the next battle, and go into it with that idea prominent in their minds, and try for once to impress it upon the mind of each man to deliver his piece as if he was firing at a target.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>I feel the greatest necessity for this, and I am confident that if we can get even <num value="1">one</num> volley fired in this way we can whip any number the enemy can bring against us. </p> </q><bibl n="The Atlanta Register,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> If you were never in a battle you would not guess that there were half the random shots fired that there are. Why, sir, I have seen whole regiments and brigades deliver their fire when I was sure that they did not even would a single man. Such firing, besides wasting the ammunition, does not intimidate the enemy at all; on the other hand it makes them feet that there is but little danger, consequently he is more bold, and delivers his fire more accurately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Besides, if men are allowed to make those random discharges, it seems to become a habit, and they become so excited at it that they would oftener miss a man at <num value="10">ten</num> paces than they would hit him. Just in that way battles are often lost, while the company commander, if he would only step it, and show them that they were doing no good, they would soon become collected, and after they once knew their folly would, of their own accord, fire deliberately, and probably save the day after it had been comparatively lost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> Why, sire, in battle you often see company commanders charging around with their swords flourishing above their heads, crying out, give it to them boys, give it to them, manifesting in themselves, and creating in others, all the excitement possible; now a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought would show to their better judgment that they were doing more harm than good, for men become so excited under such circumstances that they would miss an elephant <num value="10">ten</num> steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>You often see the above blustering around when the enemy are at least off at a distance of <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">one thousand yards</measure>, and to hear the roar of musketry and the excited commanders you would think they would soon come to a hand to had contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>What is it that excites a man in battle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Why, it is the danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>If you shoot at a man once he is very much excited; shoot at him a <num value="100">hundred</num> times and miss him every time, and all his fear and excitement is gone; but reserve you fire until you can do some execution, and when they come fire into them, cut his clothes, wound his neighbor, kill the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> man from him, and let him see it, and I tell you <num value="75">seventy-five</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> out of every <num value="100">hundred</num> will break and run, and then a charge, with our infernal yell, and the day is ours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> Another very important point, after we have whipped and routed the enemy: Let us all resolve to keep each and every man in his place, ready to follow up our advantage and secure the fruits of the victory; not such things as we can get from the dead and wounded; but <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, prisoners, and then his artillery, wagon trains, &#x0026;c, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> Oh! let us do it, by all means; we can do it; and let us all determine to act together, and the result will be (not as it was at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, and the army scattered over the battle-field, pillaging the dead and wounded) but a victory such as never was known to our arms, and may give us back <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> (the glorious old State) in place of a few greenbacks, haversacks, old <rs n="pocket knives" type="product">pocket knives</rs>, and just such trash as was the fruits of <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, where the bones of so many of our noble and brave boys lie bleaching on the plains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> The last foreign news announces the departure of the new <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">Emperor</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> for his <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> home and empire on the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num>--<unclear></unclear> to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>As the reader is aware, from our paper of yesterday, it has been stated by the <rs>London</rs> <hi rend="italics">Globe</hi> that <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00279" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, our <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, sought an interview with the <rs>Emperor</rs> while he was in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, which was &#x0022;courteously but firmly decline.&#x0022; Very little attention need be paid this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>If true, it is of little moment; but it is very doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The recognition of the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> is of small interest to us, except so far as it may involve that of the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Indeed, Maximillian stands more in need of our recognition than we do of his, though a polite how from either to the other just now could confer no material advantage, and could only give assurance of that sympathy and friendship which we all know must of necessity exist by force of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>We all know that that power by whose aid alone <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00280" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName> can become firmly seated on his throne is decidedly friendly to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and that nothing will grow out of the <name>Franco</name>--<rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> policy that can be prejudicial to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> Even the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> cannot chuckle over this bit of diplomatic rumor, as they know these facts as well as we. Moreover, they find enough in their own relations with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> to absorb their attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>If rumor, also, from <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00281" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> be correct, <persName n="Dayton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00282" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Minister, has tendered to <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00283" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName> amicable relations on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> monarchy, and this tender the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> has just unanimously repudiated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> So the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is easy &mdash; has nothing to apprehend from <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> relations &mdash; while the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are neither easy nor inapprehensive on the subject. </p> </div3>
