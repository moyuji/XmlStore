<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>For a <unclear></unclear>of the action in this, its <unclear></unclear> phase, I take great pleasure in <unclear></unclear> the report of that consummately <unclear> </unclear> officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>From it you will <unclear></unclear> it was that our pieces, at the close <unclear></unclear> interchange of fire, were <unclear></unclear> withdrawn, inducing our friends <unclear></unclear>left, and evidently the <unclear></unclear> that they had been silenced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <unclear></unclear> <time value="9:30oclock">half-past 9 o'clock</time>, a strong <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> column of infantry was seen to move towards our left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Having crossed the so-called river, (in fact a shallow stream, of about <measure n="20yards" type="distance">20 yards</measure> in width,) near the point designated on the map by the capital letter &#x0022;A,&#x0022; it undertook to turn our position in that direction. --Soon, however, it encountered a portion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3ARRegiment">3d Arkansas regiment</orgName>, which drove it precipitately back, with a destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The enemy subsequently turned <num value="2">two</num> of his pieces upon this portion of our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, pouring out cannister and shell in large volumes; but, fortunately, on account of the protection afforded by the woods, with but little execution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Simultaneously with this movement towards our left, another column of infantry ascended the wooded hill, before our <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>, at the point designated upon the map by the capital letter &#x0022;B.&#x0022; Having become at its head involved in a slight skirmish with <num value="1">one</num> of our <orgName n="Picket Guards" type="guards">picket guards</orgName>, it was immediately and strongly reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Subsequently to the repulse of the column from our left flank, it proceeded in the same general direction, ascending the hill at the point designated by the letter &#x0022;C.,&#x0022; swelling the force, which now began to threaten seriously our front and right, to some <num value="4000">four thousand</num> men. They moved along the side of the hill, opening upon our lines a desultory fire of rifle musketry, which was continued till the close of the action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>So soon as the designs of this column were fully developed, I ordered the <orgName type="regiment" key="12GARegiment">12th Georgia regiment</orgName> to take position near the stream, where a small detachment of it, under <persName n="Dawson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Dawson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Dawson</surname></persName>, had already been posted, with instructions to engage the enemy whenever he should attempt to cross it. From the fact that this movement was made in full face of largely superior numbers, armed with a superior weapon, and protected by cover of the forest, it was made with an alacrity and regularity which deserve high commendation as does also the cool determination with which this command, protecting itself as best it might against the enemy's fire, received it, but returned scarcely a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Not long thereafter I ordered <persName n="Shumaker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Shumaker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shumaker</surname></persName> to open upon the same column, directing his fire to where he supposed the head of it to lie. This he promptly did with <num value="2">two</num> of his pieces, and so effectively that in a short time the unmistakable evidences of their rout became apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Distinctly could their officers be heard, with words of mingled command, remonstrance, and entreaty, attempting to rally their battalions into line and to bring them to the charge; but they could not be induced to reform their broken ranks, nor to emerge from the cover of the woods in the direction of our fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Rapidly and in disorder they returned into the turnpike, and soon thereafter the entire force of the enemy &mdash; artillery, infantry, and cavalry &mdash; retreated in confusion along the road and adjacent fields, leaving behind them, at different points, numbers of their killed, guns, knapsacks, canteens, etc., etc. Among other trophies taken were a stand of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors, which are held subject to the order of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> This engagement lasted from <time value="7am">seven in the morning</time> to <time value="2:30oclock">half-past 2 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, at which time the enemy, who had come with artillery to bombard and demoralize us, with infantry to storm our camp, with cavalry to rout and destroy us, and with <hi rend="italics"><measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> cooked rations</hi> in his haversacks, to prosecute a rapid march either towards <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> or towards <placeName key="tgn,2118671" n="1.000 14" reg="huntersville, pocahontas, west virginia">Huntersville</placeName>, was in precipitate retreat back to his <placeName reg="Cheat Mountain, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,2234058">Cheat Mountain</placeName> fastness. --And it is a matter not unworthy of mention, that, while his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> insolent advances were received with defiant cheers, running from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other of our line, he was permitted to take his departure under the simple reports of our pieces, firing upon him so long as he continued within their range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The relative weakness of our force, and the entire absence of cavalry, prevented our pursuing him, and thereby realizing the legitimate fruits of our triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>His loss in killed and wounded is estimated at from <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="300">three hundred</num>, among them an officer of superior rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Our own, I am happy to say, was very inconsiderable, not exceeding, <num value="50">fifty</num> in all. This most gratifying result is to be attributed, in a great degree, to the remarkable coolness of regimental and company officers, who never seemed for a moment to lose their presence of mind &mdash; never allowed their men unnecessarily to expose themselves, and profited by every advantage of ground and position to shelter them from danger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> In conclusion, I take great pride in saying that the bearing of all the troops, both officers and men, with but few exceptions, was highly creditable to themselves and to the army. --Among those who enjoyed the opportunity covered by all of attracting special notice, in addition to the name of <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, I would mention those of <persName n="Shumaker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Shumaker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Shumaker</surname></persName>, who was wounded at his battery, to whom I have already had repeated occasion to refer; of <persName n="Rice,Captain,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="default:Rice,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Rice</surname></persName>, of whom <persName n="Shumaker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Shumaker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Shumaker</surname></persName> speaks in the following emphatic language: &#x0022;He had been working his piece beautifully for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, and too much praise cannot be given him for the deliberate manner with which he loaded and fired his piece, loading and firing by detail for an hour in the midst of a storm of shot and shell from the enemy,&#x0022; until he was stricken to the earth severely wounded, of <persName n="Desbler,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Desbler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Desbler</surname></persName>, who directed a rapid fire with marked effect; and of <persName n="Graves,Sergeant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Graves,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Graves</surname></persName>, who fell mortally wounded in the cool and gallant discharge of his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>We believe that he may so far succeed as to cause many Southern regiments to remain at home for the purpose of keeping the slaves in order, but that he will receive from his newly invited allies any efficient assistance is a matter with respect to which we must be permitted to express the gravest doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The position of the free negro in the <rs>Northern States</rs> is in no respect enviable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> --This question is the ruling topic of the day. It puzzles military critics, and politicians who can see through a millstone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>But as this plan of operations would, if seriously attempted, almost certainly result in the destruction or capture of both these columns, we have no idea that it will be tried.
