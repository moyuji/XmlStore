<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> --When we fire learned essentially that <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> had backed out, and determined to deliver up <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, although we had expected such an issue, we nevertheless felt sorry, if not disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We had just a faint spark of hope that he would be fool enough to stand up to his bluster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We were anxious to see the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet sunk or burned, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> intruders at <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> and <placeName reg="Ship Island cut">Ship Island cut</placeName> off from all succor by sea and left in our hands, New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> bombarded and burnt to the ground, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> steamboats on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> driven aground and set on fire, a heavy Confederate force thrown on shore in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> by the <orgName n="British fleet" type="fleet">British fleet</orgName>, Yankeedom invaded from <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> by a British army, and the whole vile race reduced to beg pardon of the civilized world for their baseness, insolence, and inhumanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We say we had some faint hopes of seeing this consummation, and we are not altogether sure we shall not see it before another summer shall have passed over our heads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> It is obvious that <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s long letter, is no answer to the demand of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName>, in at least <num value="1">one</num> important particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName>, in the most imperative terms, insists that the <rs>Commissioners</rs> shall be restored to the protection of the <rs>British</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>That demand has been complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He insists that a suitable apology shall be made for the affront.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>That has not been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>On the contrary, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> opens a new question, the decision of which in his favor, must deprive <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> of all right to transport anybody whom he may choose to designate as a rebel, on <num value="1">one</num> of her ships, as long as this war may chance to continue.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> --The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> holds in most contemptuous estimation the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves have confessed the inefficiency of this arm of their service, by the novel and despicable expedient of calling to its aid the granite quarries of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, and the rotten hulks of New Bedford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The South has no fleet; and it is a very small navy indeed that cannot render effective a blockade which embraces less than <num value="20">twenty</num> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>A <num value="100">hundred</num> vessels of moderate size, with a due complement of small craft for shallow waters, would seem to be an abundant armament for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Yet the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> confess to a weaker naval force than this comparatively small <num value="1">one</num>, by resorting to illicit and malicious measures of making good their blockade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> To be valid in the eye of the law of nations, a blockade must be effective; and effective to that degree, that it becomes impossible to pass through it. The passage of a single vessel at a single point proves the whole affair to be vicious by reason of its inefficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>If vessels be captured in the act of running a blockade not effective, their condemnation in a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize court</orgName> of the blockading power will be illegal, and will cause a quarrel between that power and the country owning the captured vessel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> Moreover, blockade to be valid must not only be effective, but must be effective by means of public armed vessels stationed in the months of the ports blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>A blockade is a naval transaction; purely naval, and enforced by no other agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>A siege is not a blockade, being the work of a land force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Nor is a barricade a blockade, being the effect of another agency than that of naval vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>A blockade effectuated by the aid of barricades sunk or built in the mouths of ports is <sic>vitisted</sic> utterly; because a Government that has not naval capacity to enforce a blockade by the regular means, has no right to exercise the measure at all. Paper blockades are the opprobrium of the public law. They were attempted in a period of frenzy by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; but both those Powers now repudiate the legality of their acts, and, at this day, no nation is disposed or dares to assert the validity of paper blockades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The doctrine is, that proclamations of blockade are valid only as a notice of the intention of the blockading Power, and that the blockade itself is only good when enforced by a sufficient naval presence to make it thoroughly effective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> If paper blockades are the opprobrium of the law of nations, how much more so are barricades planted in the mouths of ports!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>If anything but an efficient naval force were permissible, it would be infinitely more expedient and proper to accept mere paper declarations of blockade as valid than to allow the permanent interests of commerce to be destroyed by stone barricades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>All commercial nations have an interest in commerce; and permanent obstructions thrown into the mouths of harbors are acts of hostility committed against the world at large no less than against the power blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The law of nations resents and resists this barbarous policy as infinitely more hurtful to the rights of neutrals than the much-abhorred paper blockades. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have lost sight of this important fact in giving out lucrative contracts for granite and rotten ships to the denizens of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The atrocity of the act of thus barricading our ports they fully feel and delight in it the more; but they were certainly ignorant of its illegality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>In the eye of the law of nations, vessels now running into the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> are exempt from capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>If they are seized and condemned as prizes, then the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will have another opportunity of displaying the white feather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> begins to thunder, and the <rs>British</rs> lion to roar about these cowardly blockades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Something serious is sure to come out of it.--<persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> will either have to let down again, or call back his <q>&#x0022;whalers&#x0022;</q> and their rocks. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> War is productive, like everything else, of a good deal of ingenuity and fraud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who walks our streets can fail to observe the large number of persons attired in the uniform of commissioned officers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>So numerous are these gentlemen that the mere sojourner in our city would almost imagine that the army had disbanded, or that the lines had been withdrawn from <placeName reg="Centerville, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098336">Centreville</placeName> and located at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>This would, however, be a great mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>While a liberal system of furloughs has existed in regard to privates and non-commissioned officers who desired to return home for the purpose of obtaining their winter clothing, or making arrangements for the support of their families during the coming year, yet every <num value="1">one</num> really enlisted is well aware of the fact that more than ordinary rigor has been observed in granting furloughs to commissioned officers, except in cases of sickness, or for an extremely limited time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>How then is it that our streets are crowded with these gay uniforms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The reply is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Persons who never saw a battle-field, and who never expect to see <num value="1">one</num>, and who never desire to see <num value="1">one</num>, in childish vanity, or criminal desire to cover fraudulent practices, decorate themselves in the honorable costume of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>We do not know that any power exists in any of the departments to correct this evil, as every <num value="1">one</num> may have the right to dress as he pleases so long as he pays his tailor, or as his tailor will credit him, yet this practice of wearing uniforms to which the wearers are not entitled is calculated to bring reproach upon gallant gentlemen who are really fighting the battles of their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> It is almost impossible to restrain our amusement at the ridiculous in even a casual walk upon the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Every few yards there is met some gaudily attired officer in appearance with head erect, aping the heroes of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, or <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2016605;tgn,2036878" n="0.143 000000.8553	placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.095 000000.5702	placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;0.048 000000.2851	placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America">Bethel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The earnestness of their exertions deserve better success than is frequently achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>So common have become these frauds that we really advise all such persons to doff their uniforms, as it deceives but a few and only makes themselves the subjects of jest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>If their love of soldiers' clothes is too intense to be surrendered, we respectfully suggest to them to obtain a right to wear them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The ranks of every company have been thinned by disease or battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Let them fill up the vacuum by prompt volunteering, and they will feel prouder in the consciousness of doing real service than they can possibly feel in a childish vanity, the gratification of which only excites contemptuous laughter. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Under the circumstances, we regard this as sensible and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>It is not believed that the necessity exists at present for calling out a poorly armed militia, which can be so much better occupied at home during the winter season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>A letter from a Halifax correspondent, alluding to the call made upon that county, says with emphasis: <q>&#x0022;We are ready to go wherever our country calls us, and pledge ourselves to whip the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, with the same weapons, wherever we meet them, but shall expect our government to provide such things as are necessary to shelter us from the cold and keep us from freezing or dying by piecemeal.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/> These considerations have doubtless received due reflection from the authorities, and the wise conclusion has been arrived at that a militia regiment, doubtfully armed, and provided with nothing but <num value="1">one</num> blanket to a man, with tin cup and frying pan, would be in no situation to encounter the hardships of a winter campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> I have written <num value="2">two</num> letters to you; but, being cut off from civilization, cannot say whether or not they were published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>I have seen but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> numbers of your paper since I left home, and they were forwarded to me by a special messenger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>We advanced from <placeName reg="Pikeville, Wayne, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076096">Pikeville</placeName> to Prestonsburg, and finding that the regiment, or rather the half brigade, could not be subsisted at that place, our General (<persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00375" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,John,J.,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName>) ordered us forward to <placeName key="tgn,2080878" n="1.000 10" reg="Mount Eaton, Wayne, Ohio">Paintville</placeName>, the county seat of <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=12">Johnson county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>This place is but <placeName><distance reg="32miles">thirty-two miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Louisa, Lawrence, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040037">Louisa</placeName></placeName>, where it is reported the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are in large force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>We arrived at <placeName key="tgn,2080878" n="1.000 10" reg="Mount Eaton, Wayne, Ohio">Paintville</placeName> <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> before <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>, and remained until <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas day</occasion></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>During our stay there we were kept constantly on our guard by the frequent reports that the enemy were advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>At day light on <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas morning</occasion></dateStruct> a messenger arrived at headquarters with the news that <num value="5000">five thousand</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, composed of infantry, cavalry, and <num value="12">twelve</num> pieces of artillery, were advancing and were driving our pickets in. The General ordered us to strike our tents, pack up, and get ready for a fight in <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>. By the time given by the <rs>General</rs> for the above duty; our regiment had every particle of baggage loaded, sent off, and were in line of battle, with guns loaded and ready for a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>At this time, we heard the firing of several guns below us, and thought the ball had opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The men and officers were cool and calm; they marched out and formed with the coolness and precision of veteran soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The staff was complete, with the exception of our <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs>, who has been absent for upwards of a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Why, I cannot tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>All the officers belonging to the regiment below the grade of field officers were present except <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role2">Lieutenants</rs>, who are absent because of sickness and detached service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>I, therefore, take great pleasure in saying that I neither saw an excited man nor officer in the regiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> <num value="1">One</num> little fact, connected with the <rs>Montgomery</rs> <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>, a company of <num value="85">eighty-five</num> men commanded by <persName n="Taylor,,James,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="default:Taylor,James,C.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Christiansburg, Montgomery, Virginia" key="tgn,2111185">Christiansburg, Va.</placeName>, will further show the resolution of the men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> enquired of them whether or not they could stand it to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Their reply was, that they would follow their <q>&#x0022;<rs type="role2">Captain</rs> to the devil;&#x0022;</q> if he could stand it, they could do so. So he had no sick men that morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The news proved to be false, after standing in line of battle for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> the <rs>General</rs> ordered us to fall back <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> above <placeName key="tgn,2080878" n="1.000 10" reg="Mount Eaton, Wayne, Ohio">Paintville</placeName></placeName>, where we are now busily engaged fortifying. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/> This is a hard section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The inhabitants are mostly unfriendly to us, and until a more decisive change takes place in the political character of this State, I do not see what good will flow from keeping us in these mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>A greater curse could not be inflicted upon all Yankeedom than to force them to invade <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> through, this section and across the <rs type="place">Cumberland mountains</rs>. </p> <closer> <signed>Veto.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The friends of members of the <num value="56" type="ordinal">56th</num> in writing letters, therefore will direct them accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>This change of destination has been as sudden as it is agreeable, and the chivalrous spirits which compose <persName n="Slaughters,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="mostcommon:Slaughters,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Slaughters</surname></persName> command will vindicate on the battle field the wisdom of the authorities in sending them to <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio" key="tgn,7013448">Bowling Green</placeName> instead of <placeName reg="Payne Gap, Letcher, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040707">Pound Gap</placeName> and Prestonsburg.
