<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Sallust; in his introduction to the <name>History</name> of the <name>Conspiracy</name> of Catiline, makes come very profound remarks upon the causes which, in the course of several centuries, had led to the establishment of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> authority over the greater portion of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, as then known to the world, and no small part of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It could scarcely be, he says in substance, from superior national wisdom or valor, for the <name>Greeks</name> greatly surpassed the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and the <name>Gable</name> in the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>He comes to the conclusion, finally, that it is owing to the number of great men who had succeeded each other in the conduct of affairs, and whose efforts had raised her, through regular gradations, from an insignificant city to the position of the ruling power of the world.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> To the same cause, we take it, is in a great structure to be attributed the superiority of the <rs>South</rs> to the <rs>North</rs> in the war which is now raging between the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It cannot reduce to our numbers because they outnumber us <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It cannot be due to our superior wealth, for though we have among us the elements of wealth in survival profusion, they enured, before the war, far more to the benefit of the enemy than to our own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It was our wealth that gave them boundless credit, and has enabled them to lavish fabulous sums upon their favorite project of subjugating it. I cannot be owing altogether to the superior sailor of our troops, although that has been conspicuous throughout the war, for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> make good soldiers, and so far outnumber us that even inferior valor might be compensated by superior strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But nothing can compensate the vast superiority of talent on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have no General who is at all equal to even those officers who are not ranked higher than <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> rate with us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It adds: Their inability not only to make way, but to hold what they have gained in any quarter, only stimulates them to resort to fresh violence in order to obtain troops which, when they have got them, they do not know how to employ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>We seem to have heard the last of bombastic appeals to the patriotic spirit of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, of lavish inducements of consulting the popular will as to the prosecution of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> The Government responds to these movements by ordering a corden to be drawn around the country, seaboard and land frontier alike, by suspending the <hi rend="italics">habeas carpus</hi> act in the case of all persons accused of endeavoring to evade military service, and by a fresh batch of arbitrary arrests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>New York itself has been placed by a stroke of the pen in a condition which can only be fairly described as a state of siege, the ordinary police of the city having been constituted a military force, and the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Superintendent">Chief Superintendent</rs> of the body being invested with the privileges and powers of a <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>--Such are the means by which a war which, we are told, is prosecuted on behalf of national right and the best interests of mankind, is to be maintained in the boasted land of freedom and of respect for popular opinion.

<head>The capture of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/> Although unofficial confirmation of the reported capture of the <rs>Federal</rs> garrison at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> reached this city yesterday, no <num value="1">one</num> doubts for a moment its reliability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Such were the plans adopted for the accomplishment of that object, that every <num value="1">one</num> feels the utmost confidence in the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Passengers who came down on the <rs>Central</rs> train yesterday afternoon state that the report had reached <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> that the whole garrison, some <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> in number, surrendered on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, besides which our forces captured about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> negroes. </p>

We do not know whether this main fort is on the <rs>Virginia</rs> side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, or on the <rs type="place">Maryland Heights</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>We suppose, however, that it must be on the <rs type="place">Heights</rs>, for with them in our possession, it would be impossible for the enemy to hold the town, as it is within easy range of shell from that point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>The cannonading on Sunday is represented to have been very heavy and the fighting unusually severe, the enemy making a most desperate and determined resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>We hardly think there can be implicit confidence in the statement that after the surrender of the larger part of the force there that <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men would attempt to continue resistance in the face of the odds against them, and conclude that the whole force has yielded to our victorious forces. </p>
