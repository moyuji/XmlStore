<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We do not suppose that the action of the <name>Senate</name> was designed to paralyze the great organ of the popular mind and heart, and to strike dumb the speaking trumpet which has summoned this nation to the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>We are inclined to the belief that their action arose from ignorance of the details of a daily office, and from supposing that a daily newspaper can be got out like a weekly newspaper, where the editor is often his own bookkeeper, reporter, writer, pressman, and packer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Now, a daily paper requires, in addition to the editor proper, reporters in both branches of Congress and of the <name>Legislature</name>, and the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> and markets; and after it is writen and printed, it requires the services of several clerks, writing all night long, to enclose and direct the paper to its multitude of subscribers through the mails.
