<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It shows that those among the <name>Abolitionists</name> who are able to see an inch beyond their noses begin to look forward already to a time when they may have to invoke that protection from the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws which they have uniformly done their utmost to prevent their adversaries from receiving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Did he believe that the tenure by which the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName> now hold power was entirely secure, he would be the last man to recommend respect for the <rs>Constitution</rs> and obedience to its requirements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He would have continued to shout and throw up his cap at every fresh proof that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> gave of his utter contempt for law, and his determination to be himself the <hi rend="italics">State.</hi> But with the sagacity common to politicians of his calibre, he perceived that the wind is shifting, and is desirous to throw an anchor ahead before it be too late, lest he be driven upon the shallows and quicksands of a minority, which he straight before him and full in his view, although unseen by others of less sagacity. --It is evidently, however, too late to provide against the danger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> For the impatience of the audience, and their determination to hear nothing against the despotism of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, proves but too clearly that Abolitionism has done its work effectually, and that every vestige of respect for the <rs>Constitution</rs> has been eradicated from the minds of that people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Their teachers have been so long telling them that it was an <hi rend="italics">incubus</hi> which they were not bound to submit to or respect, that they have all come to regard it in that light, and now let them unteach them if they can. <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,nomatch:0"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> and his fellows resemble the pupil of the magician, who, having raised the d &mdash; l by means of his master's spells, was unable to lay him again, and was torn to pieces for his pains. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> It is humiliating to the pride of humanity to observe the rapid progress which despotism has made in subduing the souls of its victims, and rendering them fit subjects for the iron rule of the tyrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Every manly feeling, every free aspiration, every independent thought, seems to have been crushed out of the souls and bodies of these unhappy people.

The facts in the case are these: Under order of the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>, the detectives are required to seize all ardent spirits brought to the city without written permission of the <rs>Marshal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>On the morning in question these detective ascertained that Walls had received <measure n="3barrels" type="mass">three barrels</measure> of liquor, and suspecting it to be contraband, repaired to his store to seize it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>As these officers hold their commissions as Confederate detectives, and claim to act under martial law, the <rs>Mayor</rs> contends that martial law is unconstitutional, and that therefore their acts are illegal, and the arrest made by them no less than &#x0022;assault and battery, &#x0022; for which they are subject to indictment by the <rs>Grand Jury</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The parties were arraigned for assault and battery, and if they should be sent on to a higher Court the question might there be argued; but, with all his respect for the <rs>Mayor</rs>, he did not deem it essential to discuss before him the right of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy, in war times like these, to exercise martial law. Military law, his Honor knew, was right and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>It was clearly laid down in the law books, and its constitutionality could not be questioned.--Not so with martial law.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> The <rs>Mayor</rs> had hoped that all the light in the power of the <rs>Government</rs> would have been afforded; but it had decided otherwise, and he must submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Cases of similar import are obliged to arise here, and if the <rs>Government</rs> declined to furnish light he should act on the best lights before him. He could see no reason for the declaration of martial law, and he denied the power of any official however high, to carry in his breast a law which would override the <rs>Constitution</rs>, set aside the privilege of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> and deprive private citizens of their rights to trial by jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>There was no such authority in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.--No man could upturn the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws of the <rs>State</rs> by proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>He was glad to hear that the case, if sent on, would be fully argued in another Court. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The <rs>Mayor</rs> then referred to the acts of some of the detectives when martial law was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proclaimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>He particularized the case of <persName n="Whitman,,Theodore,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="default:Whitman,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, who was dragged from his house under martial law for selling liquor, and thrown into prison.

On this decision the officials threatened an appeal to a higher tribunal, and the record was prepared, but thus far it has not been taken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> The <rs>Mayor</rs> next alluded to the complaints made by Government officials of the city police interfering with the <name>Provost</name> detectives in the discharge of their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>He had always directed his officers not to interfere with the detectives in the discharge of their duty, and was sure they had not done so. On inquiry &mdash; for he intended to keep in the city employ no longer any officer who had violated his orders &mdash; he ascertained that the complaint are <unclear></unclear> in this wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Some detectives or guards, with a deserter in charge, had their prisoner to escape from them in the night time, and fired their muskets at him as he fled through the streets.--Some of the watchmen being night, arrested <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> the party by whom the musket was fired, and they did right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It were better that a deserter should escape than an innocent party should be killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/><num value="2">Two</num> negroes were killed in the streets for attempting to escape the guards, and innocent parties might have been shot down at any moment but for a complaint mode to <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, and an order issued by that General, which put an end to street shooting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/> The <rs>Mayor</rs> then reviewed the conduct of some of the detectives towards his police, and complained that they had been derelict in duty, as well as had men and officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Without calling nacres, he stated that <num value="1">one</num> of these detectives had interfered with his police, and attempted to prevent them from making arrests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>When the facts were made known to him, be issued a warrant for the arrest of that party, and that warrant was served upon the accused in a brothel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Another, finding that warrants had been issued for the arrest of certain parties, preceded his officers, and gave the inmates of the houses notices that the <rs>Mayor</rs>'s warrant was coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Another, Rosvalley, had obtained <measure n="1100dollars" type="currency">$1,100</measure> from <num value="1">one</num> party under false pretences, and had been the means of having arrested a number of respectable citizens, by making oath that they were disloyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Another had the audacity to apply at a respectable hotel for lodgings for a common harlot, where she was to be associated with respectable ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Others, for driving about the streets in carriages and buggies with lewd women, to the scandal of the community; others for being in a small house, of <num value="2">two</num> rooms, where a murder was committed, without their being able to arrest or discover the murderer; and others, for dogging about the streets a respectable gentleman from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, following him into a bar-room, and there arresting and dragging him before the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>, for offering to pass city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> notes, which they choose to pronounce bogus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>As the head of the police, he was responsible for the morals of the city, and would enforce its ordinances and the laws of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>He would not permit the detectives to interfere with his police in the discharge of their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He would not permit them to obtain money by false pretences and escape punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He would not permit them to take harlots into respectable boarding-houses, there to be associated with decent persons; nor would he allow them to ride about the streets with lewd women, to insult ladies and to outrage morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>He would not permit them to dog respectable citizens about and arrest them for passing city notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>With the laws of the <rs>State</rs> and the ordinances of the city the detectives have nothing to do, and should not interfere with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Let them attend to the <rs>Confederate</rs> laws, and they will have enough to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> The <rs>Mayor</rs> believed that if that worthy patriot and estimable <name>Christian</name> gentleman, <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, knew of the abuses by these detectives, he would have them reformed at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>For himself, believing martial law to be unconstitutional, and the act with which the parties are charged to be in violation of the laws of the <rs>State</rs>, he should be compelled to send the parties on to the <rs>Grand Jury</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>He was not there to inquire into the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> or <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the detectives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>If any of them have been guilty of murder, bribery, or other crimes, the <rs>Mayor</rs> had certainly been derelict in not punishing them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> The <rs>Mayor</rs> admitted his dereliction, but gave as a reason for it his desire to prevent a conflict with the <rs>Government</rs> officials at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>He desired the detectives to know his opinions and his future course of action, and trusted that the <rs>Government</rs> officials would clearly understand him. </p> </div3>
