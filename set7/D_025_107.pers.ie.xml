<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> This is a subject of deep anxiety to the whole Confederacy at this moment &mdash; the deeper, perhaps, that the late movement of the enemy by the river and his occupation of <placeName key="tgn,2604791" n="1.000 1" reg="raccoon mountain, marion, tennessee">Raccoon Mountain</placeName> seems neither to have been resisted nor anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It gives him, at the same time, a great advantage by placing him on our left flank at the moment when our centre and right are occupied with the body of the place itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers say they have assembled <num value="110000">110,000</num> men, and that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s force is only <num value="60000">60,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We do not believe that this statement is correct in any particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>We have no idea that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force is so large, or that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s is so small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Be it, however, as they represent, <num value="60000">60,000</num> of our men, placed as these are, may very well bid defiance to <num value="110000">110,000</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We have no apprehension whatever of a defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The worst that we fear is <num value="1">one</num> of those furious and indecisive battles so characteristic of this war. We do not believe that any force the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can bring will be able to carry the exceedingly strong position of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, fortified with so much care and defended by so many brave men as he has with him. It is evident, in the meantime, that a great battle must inevitably be fought in the neighborhood of Lookout, if it has not already-occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The enemy will make desperate exertions to break through our lines at that point, it being his object to secure possession of the railroad where it runs south of the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, and thus render it an easy thing to supply <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> with provisions and troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We await the event with anxiety, but without apprehension. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> We have before given an account of the locality of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and here repeat it, that our readers may have a clearer idea of the operations in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Just at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> the river makes a bend in the form of a <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoe</rs>, the toe of the shoe pointing south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>On this toe, and on the south side of the river, <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> is situated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>To the west of it, and at the distance of <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two miles and a half</measure>, is <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>, which runs down to the very river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Along the base of the mountain runs the railroad, which crosses the river about <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>To the west of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> lies <placeName key="tgn,2604791" n="1.000 1" reg="raccoon mountain, marion, tennessee">Raccoon Mountain</placeName>, and between them lies the <rs type="place">Lookout Valley</rs>, a <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> running through the middle of it. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the other night left <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> in pontoons, floated down the river, without being hailed by a single sentinel, so far as we can learn, landed and occupied <placeName key="tgn,2604791" n="1.000 1" reg="raccoon mountain, marion, tennessee">Raccoon Mountain</placeName>, almost without resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>They have thrown bridges across below, and are constantly receiving reinforcements in that direction. --<orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, under the command of <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>, tried to dispossess them the other day, but failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The battle will be fought in the <rs type="place">Lookout Valley</rs> and its vicinity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> The hopes of the country were very high when <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> driven back to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It was believed that he could be shut up there, and that his supplies would be so effectually cut off as to render it imperative upon him either to fight <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> at a great disadvantage, to attempt to retreat across a wide river, and a rugged and impracticable country, thereby running the risk of ruin to his whole force, or to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>But the exceedingly dilatory movements of our army have lost us all the advantage we had, or believed we had, a few weeks ago. They have afforded time to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to collect troops from the most distant quarters, to restore their communications at their leisure, and to threaten us with a siege, instead of undergoing <num value="1">one</num> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>If <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> should be driven from his position, we not only lose <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> entirely, but we open the door for the invasion of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, where there is a very large supply of cotton, which formed the main inducement of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>'s invasion of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>It will thus be seen that the most important interests are involved in the operations around <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The existence of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is not it is true, exactly involved, but the length of the war undoubtedly is. Could that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army have been destroyed the war would have been virtually at an end. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Why the difference?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> The spirit in which this war has been conducted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government and people is an indelible stain upon the boasted civilization of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>If the war which they have made upon us had been ever so just in itself, their manner of conducting it has been such as to render the original merits of the quarrel a matter of inferior importance, and to place their enemies upon a vantage ground in which they may appeal to the justice of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the sympathies of mankind for the success of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The history of war among civilized nations may be searched in vain for a parallel to the perfidy, inhumanity and cruelty which both the <rs>Executive</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the <rs>Generals</rs> and soldiers under its command have exhibited toward the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>This is not the language of passion or prejudice, but a plain and undeniable historical fact, which has been demonstrated every day and every night for nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, in massacred prisoners, burning dwellings, peaceable citizens shot down at their own firesides, multitudes carried into dreary captivity, and women and children driven from their homes to find shelter in the woods and among wild beasts, or the pitiless charities of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Time would fail us, and language has no power to depict all the vast variety of innumerable atrocities which we have suffered at their hands, and not <num value="1">one</num> of which belong to war as it is now carried on by civilized nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> It must be reserved for calmer hours, and a more philosophical analysis than we are able to bestow upon <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> character, to explain how it is that a people professing to be the cream and essence of <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century civilization have converted themselves at a bound into the brutes and barbarians which our enemies have proved themselves in this war. Why the difference between the humanity and decorum which, even according to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> testimony, were exhibited by the <rs>Confederates</rs> when invading the <rs>North</rs> and the unheard-of ferocity and ruffianism of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops upon Southern soil?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We believe that the causes must be looked for in essential differences of character and training between the <rs>South</rs> and that heterogeneous compound, not only of all nations, but of the vilest blood of all nations which constitutes what is called &#x0022;the <rs>North</rs>.&#x0022; That the standard of virtue and of real civilization has been always higher in the slaveholding than the non-slaveholding States we have never doubted for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The principles of morality and religion have been more universally respected and practiced, there has been a loftier sense of personal honor, the agricultural mode of life has secured the <rs>South</rs> from the vices which <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> commerce and wealth bring in their train, the homogeneous character of the people has saved them from the corrupting miasma which is engendered by the sewers of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> immigration, and the influences of the educated classes &mdash; which demagogism has never been able to subvert here &mdash; have contributed their powerful aid to the tone and elevation of Southern society. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> Whatever the cause, and whatever may be the results of this quarrel, the <rs>North</rs> has degraded itself irreparably in its mode of conducting this war. It has shown that any society which casts off the restraints of religion, which prides itself upon universal equality, and acknowledges no superiors in earth or heaven, must degenerate into an assemblage of brutes and demons, whose fitting end is to be destroyed. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The militia bill</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> If the <name>Legislature</name> has not accomplished much by what it has done, it has conferred a public benefit by what it has left undone in the failure to pass a militia bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Men under the age of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and past the age of <num value="45">forty-five</num> are incapable of rendering any military service which would compensate for the injury to the public interests that would result from their withdrawal from the industrial and productive enterprises of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>A week's exposure to the rigors of camp life would work destruction among the old men and boys of the community, and leave the agriculture and manufactures of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> without enough intelligent labor to carry them on. We are already suffering from the want of men enough to carry on those branches of industry by which the army and the people at large are clothed and fed. We need producers more than soldiers, or, if more soldiers are required, they should be drawn from those who are engaged in occupations not essential to the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>So far as raids are concerned, voluntary organizations can and ought to be found in every county of men of every age capable of military duty; but this is a very different thing from a levy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> of the whole population, involving an expensive and cumbrous State establishment uncalled for by any public emergency or necessity. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>In regard to the subject of reconstruction, on which some had presumed to question his soundness, he said he should be almost ashamed to own himself an Alabamian if he could believe there was a man in the <rs>State</rs> who would agree to the reconstruction of the old Union.
