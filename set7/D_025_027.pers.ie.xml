<head>The Confederacy on the waters.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> There is no music so sweet to Southern cars at the rear of Confederate guns on the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>There is no constellation so bright to Southern eyes as the <rs>Battle Cross</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> flying at the masthead of such a Sea King as <unclear></unclear>. There is no arena more full of hope, promise and vengeance to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause than the broad highway of the <name>Ocean</name>, and no ally in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> who can do half as much for us an old <persName n="Neptune,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Neptune,nomatch:0"><surname>Neptune</surname></persName>, who is constantly throwing into our hands rich argosies, and speeding us with propitious inspirations ever his vast race track, to vex, and torment, and overwhelm the flying coursers of Northern commerce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We have always believed that the straight road in New York, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, was not over the valleys and mountains of the land, but straight out upon the blue waves of the great deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Give us the ships and the seamen, and we can cut the pipes that supply all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cities with their wealth, without any of the difficulties of transportation and the vast force requisite to keep open lines of communication which are essential to an invasion by land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A ship-of-war or a privateer furnishes her own transportation, keeps opener own lines of communication, and can advance or retreat as is most expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If she sees fit to fall back the wilderness of waves furnishes her a <num value="1000">thousand</num> recesses of concealment; if she desires to swoop down upon unprotected merchantmen they lie scattered on every sea, and as helpless as chickens when the hawk hovers over their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>No people ever had so keen an appreciation of the value of privateers as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in our former wars with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and they let them loose every day of the week and on every wave of the sea. The Confederacy should now commend that potent chalice to their own lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The decision of the <rs>English Judges</rs> in the <rs>Alexandria</rs> case gives us full command of <name>British</name> ship yards, and we shall be idiots and dolls if we do not avail ourselves to the full of this golden opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The immense gains of these enterprises will bring seamen in abundance to our flag, if we only have the wisdom and energy to devotes our whole resources and power to the <num value="1">one</num> grand object of the destruction of Northern commerce on the seas. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> At the beginning of this war the <rs>South</rs> had no navy and no privateers, whilst the <rs>North</rs> was almost as strong upon the waters as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> when the last war between <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Never was <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> more arrogant in her claims of exclusive dominion to the deep than was the <rs>North</rs>, so far as Southern pretensions were concerned, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago. But she is now beginning to find that it is not on the land alone that Southern prowess and enterprise are to be dreaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We have the flower of the old navy under the <rs>Southern</rs> flag &mdash; in <persName n="Maury,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Maury,nomatch:0"><surname>Maury</surname></persName> and <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Brooks,nomatch:0"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, the most scientific; in <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName>, <persName n="Maffit,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Maffit,nomatch:0"><surname>Maffit</surname></persName>, and others, the most chivalric and energetic of naval commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Other names will arise, as opportunities are afforded, which will emblazon with new glory the ocean flag of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName> alone we have produced a naval prodigy not surpassed since the days of <persName n="Jones,,Paul,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Jones,Paul,,,"><foreName>Paul</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If a Government and people will but lend their whole energies and resources to the organization of a navy and privateers, we shall drive <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce from the ocean and inflict more injury upon the great cities of the <rs>North</rs> than <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> campaigning by land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> We may lose ships, but every ship, property manned and managed, will have more than balanced her destruction before she can fall into an enemy's hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A cloud of privateers let loose upon a nation whose chief wealth is derived from its commerce, are worse than a swards of mosquitoes upon a fat man in the swamps of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He may work himself into a fury, and crush between his sweating palms half a dozen or more of the vexatious assailants, but he will be blinded and bled to death in the end by the host of nimble and ravenous persecutors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There are no such terrors for the <rs>North</rs> in all the armies the <rs>South</rs> can raise as in the ships of war and privateers that are beginning to hover about her commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We might slaughter whole hecatombs of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> rank and file, but, being mostly poor men and foreigners, their loss does not amount to a flea bite on the sensibilities of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Touch the <rs>Almighty Dollar</rs> however, and the iron enters their soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Perforate their pockets and you breach their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>And their pockets are their merchantmen afloat on every sea; there is the seat of their vitality, their sensibility, their soul, and when that is smitten, a universal pang cramps and collapses the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> If, then, we must maintain the defensive line on land, let us at once, and with indomitable will and energy, assume the aggressive on the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Let us attack New York, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, on the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, the <rs>Pacific</rs>, the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> ocean, and wherever a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ship traverses the deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Let private enterprise back up the <rs>Government</rs> in this, the most direct, the most practical and the most pungent method of making the <rs>North</rs> feel this war. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>What will they do with us?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> informs us that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Cabinet are consulting about the proper mode of treating the conquered Southern rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Part of them are in favor of granting an amnesty to all but the civil and military leaders, and prospective emancipation of the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves; others for extreme punishment and immediate abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>All of them, however, are united on counting the chickens before they are hatched, and cooking the fish before they catch him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> We are not informed whether our own Cabinet are consulting about the proper disposition to be made of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Possibly we may exempt their military and civil leaders from punishment, as they have had little else for the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. If they will come to terms at an early day we may grant an amnesty to the rank and file, on condition that they never show their faces again, in peace or war, within the borders of Dixie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The white slaves of the <rs>North</rs> must be at once emancipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>For this purpose our Government might deem it proper to propose to all deserters of foreign birth from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> conscription work enough to support them and their families on this side the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>As soon as the men dragooned into the <rs>Federal</rs> ranks reach the <rs>South</rs>, we should offer every inducement and facility to them to quit their detested bondage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> indulges the delightful idea that, after the rebellion is crushed, the united armies of <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> will cooperate to whip out <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> from every vestige of foothold upon this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> must be blind indeed if such developments as these do not startle them from their suicidal neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> can scarcely imagine that the present war, whatever its result, will facilitate such an enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>If the <rs>South</rs> is conquered, it will be because its fighting population has been exterminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>In that event nobody will be left to fight <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If the <rs>South</rs> succeeds <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> she will have no despotism to embroil herself on Northern account with any nation of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In any event that would heartily sympathize with any nation within would make war upon the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Of the cannot have her own independence, this would infinitely prefer being a French of <name>British</name> province to coming under <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> destitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> may rest satisfied that <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> the <rs>South</rs> approaches subjugation as <unclear></unclear> as that journal imagines she is at this payment, she will make her own choice of masters. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Thorough organization, providing for signals of the approach of the enemy, for placing obstructions in their way, and consist of plan and action, are absolutely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In those cases where it is impossible to prepare obstructions against the advance of an enemy, it must be easy at least to embarrass and obstruct their retreat; to block up and barricade the roads by which they come, so that at any rate it will not be easy to get back.
