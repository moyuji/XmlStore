<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We the people of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, in Convention assembled, having been called together to consider the present distracted and unhappy relations existing between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding members of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, and to provide suitable and adequate remedies for the evils which flow from those relations, do most solemnly declare, that, whilst we have always kept and performed all the covenants of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> on our part, truly, fully, and in good faith, our non-slaveholding confederates have not only failed and refused to keep the same, and still continue so to refuse, but they have palpably violated them, both in their letter and spirit, in repeated instances, wherein their faithful performance was of the most essential and vital consequence to our peace, but safety, and our happiness. </p> </q><bibl n=""></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> In proof of this, we submit to the candid and impartial judgment of mankind, the following plain recital of facts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The people of these States have, for the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> or more, assailed negro slavery &mdash; an institution recognized by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and of vital importance in the social and industrial systems of this and the other Southern States; without scruple as to the means of mode of attack, and without regard to the consequences to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> They have, during this whole period, been abusing the great rights of freedom of speech and of the press, continued to agitate and discuss this social and domestic relation of <hi rend="italics">ours,</hi> not <hi rend="italics">theirs,</hi> on the hastings, in the pulpit, in the halls of legislation of individual States and of Congress &mdash; through the political press &mdash; through books, pamphlets and the drama, to our great annoyance and injury; and against our repeated remonstrances, and our entreaties that these unfriendly acts should be forborne. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> They have prostituted the mail service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, designed to facilitate friendly, social and commercial correspondence, to the unholy purpose of distributing incendiary publications among our people &mdash; thereby disturbing our peace, rendering our slaves discontented and unhappy, and inciting them to insurrection and rebellion against their masters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> They have for the same unholy purposes sent emissaries and incendiaries among us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> They have encouraged and promoted the invasion of our soil by lawless men, armed against our peace, our prosperity, and our lives; and have, by public ovations, converted into heroes and martyrs the murderers of our people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> A majority of those States have persistently refused to comply with the provision of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> for the rendition of fugitives from labor; and have, by legislative <sic>enacments,</sic> impeded, hindered and prevented the execution of the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law, made in pursuance of that provision, and <sic>sevaral</sic> of said States have refused to surrender fugitives from justice, in cases where the crime imputed to the fugitive consisted in a violation of our rights with respect to slaves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> These States have, with <num value="1">one</num> voice, denied to this and the other slaveholding States an equal participation in the common territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with the avowed object of confining slavery within its present limits, and of <q>&#x0022;placing it in the course of ultimate extinction.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> And, finally, they have set up over us an absolute despotism, consisting in the unchecked will of a mete sectional and numerical majority, which has seized upon the powers of Government and holds them for our present injury and ultimate destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> By these means, the powers granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs> have been perverted to our injury and oppression, and a foreign rule has been established for the control of our interests, the subversion of our rights, and our complete subjugation to absolute power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>And, whereas, when the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in Convention assembled, assented to and ratified the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, they did declare and make known <q> &#x0022;that the powers granted under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, being derived from the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, may be resumed by them whenever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression, and that every power not granted thereby remains with them and at their will.&#x0022;</q> Now, therefore, we the people of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, conscious of the right, and hoping under <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to maintain it, do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, that the <name>Ordinance</name> adopted by us, in Convention, on the <dateStruct value="1788-06-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year>1788</year>,</dateStruct> whereby the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> was ratified, and also all acts and parts of acts of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> of this State, ratifying amendments of the said Constitution, are hereby repeated, rescinded and abrogated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>After alluding to the present secession movement as a national suicide, and the greatness and power of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Confederacy, he said the questions involved were Union or Disunion &mdash; peace or civil war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He respected her spirit, and had no desire to do her injustice; but went on to show that it was not an apprehension for the safety of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> that caused her to seek redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It was his opinion that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was not invited to a banquet of prosperity and power, but to a carnival of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> Very few, I apprehend, realize to their full extent the almost insurmountable difficulties which lie in the way of the reduction of its massive granite walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>In truth, with an adequate garrison, it can hardly be doubted that the <rs>Fort</rs> would be altogether impregnable to any force that the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> would be able to bring against it. Even with the <num value="86">eighty-six</num> men who now constitute the garrison to oppose them, I doubt whether there are many volunteer armies in the world that would not quail when brought face to face with the terrible fact that those towering parapets have to be carried by assault at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>For the benefit of those who have never seen the position which the <rs>Fort</rs> occupies in the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, I will recapitulate briefly some of the circumstances which combine to give it so formidable a character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great difficulty that stares us in the face is that to take these walls &mdash; unapproachable by land &mdash; we have no navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Storming parties, then, would have to approach the walls either in steamboats or row-boats for a distance of full <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile under the fire of shells, red-hot solid shot and grape.--But, supposing this ordeal passed, and that the assailants have reached in safety the foot of the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Amid the unpleasant concomitants of showers of hand grenades and volleys of musketry they must elevate their ladders, which, being more than <measure n="70feet" type="distance">seventy feet</measure> long, must necessarily be very heavy and unwieldy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Now comes another and very serious trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Where are they to plant their scaling ladders?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The water adjacent to the walls is too deep, and, to prevent all chance of the ladders being hooked on to the edge of the parapet, <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> has cunningly had his men at work sloping off the edge of the masonry, and removing every ledge of ornamental brickwork which might expedite the process of fixing the ladders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Thus you see the only chance is to have the boats or rafts, upon which the storming parties approach, of sufficient strength and solidity to sustain the foot of the ladders while the men ascend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>How far it is likely that such a solid structure could be brought uninjured under the walls, after having passed the discharges of the <num value="80" type="ordinal">eightieth</num> columbiads in the casemates, I leave you to judge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> These are only a portion of the discouraging facts which render the assault of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> a rather serious matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>I have detailed them merely to explain why it has been necessary that the preparations should have been correspondingly elaborate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The annals of warfare present few instances where so formidable a post has fallen before means of attack so entirely inadequate.

<head>The village wonders.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/> Like <num value="1">one</num> greater than either of us, <q>&#x0022;we woke <num value="1">one</num> morning, and found ourselves famous.&#x0022;</q>--We had waked the previous morning very humdrum, ordinary specimens of the feminine gender, in <placeName reg="Edinburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2111589">Edinburg</placeName>; <hi rend="italics">this</hi> morning, we found ourselves at a Highland village, and, as I have above said, famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>Who are they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>That was the question that absorbed the postmaster and the toll-keeper &mdash; it perplexed the minister and the hotel-keeper &mdash; it interested the visitors at the hotel, and the cotters by the loch-side &mdash; the very dogs and birds inquired in their mute language, <q>&#x0022;Who are they?&#x0022;</q> --It's a pity we were not young men, for we could have enjoyed ourselves much more even than we did, since we should not have needed to be so proper and quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>That was what we were not; but what we were, was the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>All that was known was, that <num value="2">two</num> ordinary-looking girls had suddenly appeared in the village at that dreamy fairy-time, a Highland sunset &mdash; that they had no luggage but what they carried in their hands &mdash; that they had immediately endeavored to secure lodgings anywhere but at the hotel, but in the scarcity of <q>&#x0022;rooms to let, &#x0022;</q> had finally got accommodation at <persName n="Stewart,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00545" reg="nearbymention:Stewart,Alfred,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName>'s small cottage; thereupon <persName n="Stewart,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00546" reg="nearbymention:Stewart,Alfred,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName> became as <num value="1">one</num> of the lions &mdash; the mouthpiece of the wonders &mdash; the oracle of the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Opinions of us varied, as the following conversations will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>It was not <persName n="Stewart,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00547" reg="nearbymention:Stewart,Alfred,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName>'s fault that she could not supply them with definite information; for, amiable and kind- hearted though she was, she was not free from that in variable failing in country villages, especially <placeName reg="Highland, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002168">Highland</placeName> ones &mdash; the love of gossip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>We easily saw how the different results of her conversations swayed her opinions, and the pleasure we found in confusing her transparent mind was quite piquant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> morning after our arrival, the postmaster and his wife found it necessary to visit <persName n="Stewart,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00548" reg="nearbymention:Stewart,Alfred,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName>. </p>
