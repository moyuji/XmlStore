<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> --We had the pleasure yesterday of a long conversation with <num value="1">one</num> of the most eminent physicians in the <rs>Southern</rs> country, who has devoted his whole time, of late, to visiting and inspecting the several camps of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, with a view to ascertaining, as far as possible, the causes of the ill health which has been prevalent among the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>As far as we could ascertain, it seemed to be his opinion that there was no special cause arising out of the actual condition of the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>They were generally kept as neat and clear of offensive matter as it was possible to keep them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>We came to the conclusion, therefore, that the evilly deeper than this, and we were induced to write this article mainly by hints derived from him. As he will see it in print, we shall cheerfully make the necessary correction wherever we shall have misconceived his views. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> We ventured to suggest sometime ago, that the seed of such disease was sewn in the close tents commonly used by the troops, and we were pleased to find the suggestion confirmed by the opinion of the gentleman in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>A closed tent, of all other contrivances in the world seems to us best adapted to secure any given amount of disease.--<num value="6">Six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num>, or sometimes a dozen men usually sleep in <num value="1">one</num> of them, and their united breath <unclear></unclear> is the atmosphere, which is not kept in a wholesome state by the introduction of fresh air. In addition to all this, whenever it rains &mdash; and the fall of rain has been unusually large this year &mdash; the interior of the tent necessarily becomes damp &mdash; The soldiers, therefore, have the double disadvantage of sleeping in an atmosphere surcharged with mephitic air and loaded with noxious vapor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>To remedy this, it appears to us that means might easily be adopted of introducing fresh air. A number of tents might be joined together having the communicating sides open and this leaving a free passage for the air. An extra tent, with nobody in it, might be pitched at <num value="1">one</num> end to serve as a porch, the other end and the end communicating with the next tent being left open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Thus the rain would be kept off by the porch, and the extreme and on the opposite side might be eased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>This is but a rough suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Persons of more ingenuity and more experience than we can boast of, could easily find some simpler and more effective method of ventilating the tents; and, we venture to suggest, it is all important that it should be found out and applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>What can be more injurious to the lung than inhalation throughout a long night of an atmosphere which has been breathed by a dozen other persons, some of them probably already beginning to feel the effects of disease? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> For our own part, however, we are for adopting the system of bivouacking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We suggested it sometime since but it met with no favor from the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>We were pleased to find that the distinguished gentleman mentioned above was very far from considering the idea ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>How could is be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It was the suggestion of a man who had and more experience on that particular subject than any other that ever lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Of a man whose whole life had been spent in camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Of a man whose mind was the most acute, perhaps, that even existed Of a man, the whole force of whose mighty intellect had been directed for <measure n="19years" type="date">nineteen years</measure> to the perfection of the soldier as a military machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Of a man who saw everything with his own eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>and suffered nothing to pass unanswered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>In late, of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>He has best on record the opinion that tents are a great obstruction to military operations in more ways than <num value="1">one</num>, but especially in that they generate disease, and render a whole army sickly It is well known that he himself dispersed with them in all his campaigns, and substituted the bivouac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>It is well known, too, that, considering the number of his armies, the ambiguous labors in which they were engaged, the long <unclear> hes</unclear> they were accustomed to make and the severe privations they were often called on to endure-no troops of modern trades were ever so healthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The soldiers on the march kindled large fires and slept around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>These lives were sufficient to purify the atmosphere, which became rarified, and carried on all the noxious vapors that were hovering in the air ready to stagnate into pestilence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Before Mantna, in a most unhealthy situation, the <rs>French</rs> besieging army was kept in good health by the simple expedient of kindling large fires every night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>In a country so full of wood as ours, it seems to us that means would never be wanting to build a temporary shelter from the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The hunters of the great <rs>West</rs> carry no tents with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> use no tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>They both kindle fires, roll themselves up in their blankets, and go to sleep by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>They are the hardiest and healthiest of the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>They are capable of enduring all sorts of fatigue and every species of privation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> There are few people who have not had occasion to notice the hateful influence which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> passage of a canal or railroad has upon a neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>As soon as the autumn sets in everybody is prostrated with chills and fevers, or typhoid fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The exciting cause is beyond question, the vast quantity of fresh earth that is turned up. This is sure to produce sickness wherever it is practiced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>How much of the sickness at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and other camps has been occasioned by the enormous quantity of earth that has been dug up we are not prepared to say. This, however, we will say. that the diabases of those camps very closely resemble those of the districts through which a canal is being cut. The bare suspicion of such a fact ought, we should think, to weigh very heavily in the scale against an in active campaign, where numbers, courage, and accede discipline are evidently on our side.--The most desperate <unclear>assank</unclear> upon <persName n="Heiglus,,Arlington,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="default:Heiglus,Arlington,,,"><foreName>Arlington</foreName> <surname>Heiglus</surname></persName> would not occasion a greater loss of life than the dull, inactive, spirit-breaking monotony of a camp, where the soldiers do nothing, and do not expect to be called on to do anything out of the ordinary routine of camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> It is this inaction which has filled the hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>And it will continue to fill them as long as it exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Let but our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> give the word to advance, and it will operate as a general hospital delivery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The men are depressed, and are therefore more than ordinary accessible to disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Set them in motion, and disease will disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>In an active campaign, the soldiers, as a general thing, are never sickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>They have no time to be sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>They have no leisure to think about themselves, and for a man to begin to think about himself is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step to a spell of sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>They think only of fighting the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Let us hope that we shall soon have a campaign of this sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Let our generals stop acting on the defensive, and carry the war into <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>That will clear the hospitals sooner than all the medicines that were ever sold at all the shops of all the apothecaries in Christendom. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>A State must either be in the old Union or out of it. If in the old Union, it is in legal epithet participant in all its constitutional acts, and <hi rend="italics">particeps criminis</hi> in all its unconstitutional ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>She remains part and parcel of it, be she ever so neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Neither the <rs>Federal</rs> or her own State officers can recognize her neutrality, which is a condition unknown to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and to the <name>Laws</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>If she forces them, against their legal and constitutional duty, to pay regard to this hypothetical neutrality, she, to that extent, requires of them unconstitutional and revolutionary acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Neutrality, if effective at all, is revolution, it is secession in effect and intent, though secession in disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is secession in an illegal form; it is secession bastardized, demoralized, and emasculated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> If <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 10" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> did not wish to take part with the <rs>North</rs> in its outrageous proceedings against the <rs>South</rs>, there were <num value="2">two</num> courses to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was simply to secede, and in her character as an independent sovereign State, to put herself in that attitude of armed neutrality so fully recognized, and so well defined in all its relations, by the <rs>Law</rs> of Nations.--The other course was not only to secede, but also to take the further step of uniting herself with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and making common cause with them against the common enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>If she cherished no more affection for the <rs>South</rs> than for the <rs>North</rs>, of course she would not take the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> step, but would remain as a neutral and at the same time an independent and sovereign State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> The attitude she did assume, however, was the most undignified, and at the same time the most ruinous <num value="1">one</num> possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>She remained in the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>She had not the pluck, the candor, or the self-respect, to cut loose from the contaminating and hateful association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>She shrank from assuming a distinct and independent nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>As to the rest of the world she remained a province and a dependency of the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>She could not constitutionally claim a distinct recognition, or assume that attitude of neutrality to which independent States only are competent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Her protestations of fealty to the <rs>Union</rs> and of neutrality between the sections, were contradictions in terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>To affect neutrality before she seceded, was grossly to stultify herself without succeeding in making a dupe of either the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>South</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The South agreed to treat her as a neutral as a measure of policy and prudence, well knowing that without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seceding from the old Union, it was a status which neither the <rs>Constitution</rs> nor the laws permitted her to assume. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> Since the recent skirmish at this place, our citizens have had a stirring time of it. Never before has <q>&#x0022;the oldest inhabitant&#x0022;</q> of the town witnessed such disorder, dismay and distress, since it has been a <q>&#x0022;local habitation.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/> After the fight of the <date value="10">10th</date> instant, which afforded our people a foretaste of the <q>&#x0022;pride and circumstance of glorious war,&#x0022;</q> we were enjoying a degree of comparative quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Desultory shots were exchanged between the hostile parties the <num value="2">two</num> succeeding days, and on last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, the reverberating echoes of the loud-mouthed cannon produced a degree of surprise and alarm not easily described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>This unexpected <hi rend="italics">salute</hi> took every <num value="1">one</num> by surprise and created no little alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, we felt inclined to flatter ourselves that it was only done to frighten us. A few minutes elapsed and it was let loose, sending a messenger, in the shape of a <num value="4">four</num>-pound ball, to apprise us that it was no laughing matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/><num value="5">Five</num> shots in all were fired, and I'm too glad to say &mdash; no injury done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/> Of course the scene that followed baffles all description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>A panic was created among the female portion of the population, who ran in every direction frightened nearly to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Numbers of them left town at once, and sought safety with their friends in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>A company of cavalry stationed here immediately proceeded to the <rs type="place">River</rs> bluffs, but being in the night time, could do but little service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/> After the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> shot was discharged, the enemy fired a volley of musketry at our men on the cliffs, and then scampered off, exclaiming; <q>&#x0022;Ah ! G &mdash; d d &mdash; n you, how do you like that ?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> Quiet was at length restored, only to be renewed next day--<dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>--when our boys kept a constant fire at them at this point, and down at the fording they returned the <q>&#x0022;<num value="4">four</num>-pound&#x0022;</q> compliment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>This latter surprised the <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs> equally as we were astonished the previous night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>What damage was done by our cannon is not exactly know.--It is reported that we <measure n="3" type="killed">killed three</measure> on the other side at this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Random shots were kept up nearly all day. In the meantime the excitement and confusion in the place was very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>The citizens were removing their families, goods and chattels as fast as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>A report prevailed that the town was to be bombarded, and <measure n="2.5hours" type="date">two hours and a half</measure> given to the women and children to leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>In less time than that nearly every woman and child was out of danger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/> Our citizens began to think it was time for hostilities to cease, so they set about to <q>&#x0022;conquer a peace,&#x0022;</q> which was done by diplomacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/><num value="3">Three</num> commissioners were appointed for that duty, who repaired to the river under a <q>&#x0022;flag of truce&#x0022;</q> to make a treaty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>They found the enemy as anxious &mdash; if not more so &mdash; for a cessation of hostilities as our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>They immediately elevated a <q>&#x0022;peace flage.&#x0022;</q> but it was with some difficulty that an officer could be induced to venture over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>However, across he came, with an armed guard, and a peace agreement was made to this effect:<q>&#x0022;If you don't fire over at us, why we won't fire over at you.&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="italics"><q>&#x0022;Nuff ced&#x0022;</q></hi>--that's a bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Well, this agreement--<q>&#x0022;child's bargain,&#x0022;</q> as it is called &mdash; was sufficient; it was enough to save the town, if strictly compiled with, but there was a feeling of distrust with regard to it. So this morning (<dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>) an alarm was created by a report that some of them were crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Our men instantly ran to the river, whilst the citizens trembled, fearing a report of a gun, and then farewell to peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/> At the present hour, <num value="12">12</num> M, the town is comparatively quiet, and it is your correspondent's earnest hope that it will so remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The firing into the town with a cannon under the cover of night may be strictly regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the most cowardly and brutal acts on record.
