<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>There is, however, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> Another important view to be considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It was impossible for the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> to know whether the entrance of the army was intended to be a mere told or a substantial occupation for their relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Tom,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s proclamation was intended to assure them of the latter, but, before it could accomplish that object military necessities carried the army away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Even, therefore, had it been in the power of the people to rise, (end I have shown that it was not,) they certainly had aright to know, before doing so, whether they would be properly supported in the attempt, or left, unarmed and unorganized, to pay the penalty of an abortive effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>We all know that to make such an effort and fall, would be inevitably to bring down upon them the redoubled vengeance of their tyrants, to consign their leaders to dungeons, to devote their property to confiscation, and to subject their mothers, wives, and daughters, to the same brutal outrages which have marked the career of the <name>Godless</name> invader from the <rs type="place">Peninsula of Virginia</rs> in to the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Would <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or any other Southern State have entered upon this revolution without the belief that the whole power of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> would be exerted to protect its citizens?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>And yet, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and every other Southern State is quite willing to accept the haggards and calamities of war; so that, should it be required by military necessity, that a part or even the whole of any <num value="1">one</num> State should be temporarily abandoned, in order to secure the triumph of the cause of all, no patriotic State would shrink from the sacrifice, however terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>We find this illustrated in the revolution of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>I can entertain no doubt that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> would be as willing to submit to such an ordeal as any State South of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>All that she asks is, to be set free and admitted into the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>She wants such an occupation of her soil by the <rs>Southern</rs> army, and for such a reasonable length of time as will enable her people to dissolve their connection with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, obtain admission into the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and arm and organize her quota of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>I cannot say, in advance of events, what length of time would be required for this purpose but, from my knowledge of the seal and determination of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I am sure that they will accomplish it within a very brief period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>If they are effectually relieved from the pressure of Federal power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Among the points made by the counset for the plaintiff was, that the <q>&#x0022;Conscript act is unconstitutional, and therefore the act itself and all regulations and orders based upon it are likewise void.&#x0022; </q> Upon this point the decision of the <rs>Judge</rs> was as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> We come now to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> point made by plaintiff's counsel to wit: That the <name>Conscript</name> art is unconstitutional, and, therefore, the act itself, and all regulations and orders based upon it are likewise void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>In every Government based on a written Constitution, containing restrictions on the legislative department, it follows necessarily that the indicatory must annul all acts in violation of that Constitution when attempted to be enforced against the citizen or his right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But we are not left to this implication, plain as it is. The <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> clause of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of this State declares Legislative acts in violation of the fundamental law are told and the judiciary shall so declare them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>If, therefore upon investigation we find this Conscript act to be in violation of the fundamental law, it must be declared void. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Our <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, like the old Federal <num value="1">one</num>, is a Government of limited and restricted powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Congress has no powers save those delegated in the <rs>Constitution</rs>; all others are withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Neither Courts, nor Congress nor <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> can change it, the plan and means for its change are nominated in the bond and necessary is not among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The inquiry, then, <unclear> </unclear> is the power to pass the <name>Conscript</name> law delegated to Congress in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It is claimed that such power is delegated in the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> clause of the <orgName type="regiment" key="8Section">8th section</orgName> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> article, which gives the power to raise and support armies, and in the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> clause following, giving the power <q>&#x0022;to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, or in any department or officer <unclear>there </unclear> &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> Now, if this law be necessary and proper for carrying from execution the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> clause <unclear> </unclear> and is not in conflict with the reserved rights of the <name>States</name>, and not in conflict with any other portion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> compact itself, then it is constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>These clauses are identical in words with the clauses on the same subject in the old Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>In the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num> clause the same section and article are reserved to the <name>States</name> the right of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress and of appointing the officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> What are we to understand by the term <q>&#x0022;militia,&#x0022;</q> as used in this clause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The language used is such as describes a thing already existing and not hereafter to be created and taken in connexion with the fact that each State which was a party to the compact already had existing a body of man called its militia, the conclusion is plain in my judgment that the term was intended to mean these bodies and not to confer on Congress the power to create a militia of its own. A strict construction gives this result, and strict construction is our settled policy and law. This militias, by our law, in all males between <num value="18">18</num> and <num value="45">45</num> not exempt by law, and by State law, too, I hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>I doubt not, when called into service, Congress might exempt others but could overrule no exemption made by the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Does this Conscript law provides for training the conscripts by the authority of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Does it not on the contrary, take away this authority from the <rs>State</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It enacts, also, that the <rs>President</rs> shall appoint the officers &mdash; a clear and palpable violation of the rights of the <name>States</name> reserved in said <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> clause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>In this view I am sustained by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The fact is recorded in his life, written by <persName n="Savage,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="default:Savage,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Savage</surname></persName>, contained in a book entitled <q> &#x0022;Our Living Representative Men,&#x0022;</q> <ref n="page 172">page 172</ref>, as follows: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The Constitution reserved to the <name>States</name>, respectively, the appointment of officers of the militia, and consequently the <unclear> mption</unclear> of this duty by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was a violation of the rights of the <name>States</name>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> The Constitution he was then living under was exact in words with the present <num value="1">one</num> on these points, and he preferred to retire to private life from the midst of his fame and usefulness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> In the preamble to our Confederate Constitution care is taken to assert and maintain that the <name>States</name> are sovereign and independent. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> In what sense can this be said of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <unclear> ry</unclear> man of her militia can be taken from under the control of her constitutional <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in Chief</rs> without his consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Must he abdicate his most important duties by permitting himself to, be disarmed of his forces, and this, too, in violation of his oath?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Nay, if Congress can pass a Conscript act with certain exemptions they can pass it without exemptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>No <num value="1">one</num> will deny this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>If therefore, they have the power to prescribe what shall be militia, and to conscribe at pleasure, they may take the <rs>Governor</rs>, the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>, and the whole Judiciary, and thus southfists <unclear> </unclear> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>This palpable infraction or the <rs>Confederate</rs> compact is sometimes, indeed, principally defended on the plea of necessity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> It is not difficult upon the whole to decide which of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> editors deserves the <sic> preeminence</sic> in evil in this war. <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> and the other cutthroat abolition organs have been thrown in the shade by the national and conservative writers, so that their claims do not even deserve to be considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> and the <orgName n="Louisville Journal" type="newspaper">Louisville <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName>, are the foremost competitors in the race for the deepest and foulest abyss in the history of journalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> have each their peculiar claims, but we are disposed to award the palm in infamy to the <orgName n="Louisville Journal" type="newspaper">Louisville <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We will give some reasons for that conclusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> <persName n="Raymond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Raymond,nomatch:0"><surname>Raymond</surname></persName>, of the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> is an intensely <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> man, a graduate of a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> college, and, like most of his tribe, supercilious and contemptuous of all other sections to the last degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>He believes there is no civilization, refinement, knowledge, or freedom outside of that narrow circle which is impregnated by the aroma of codfish and onions, and is more intolerant towards the institutions and religion of other people than any other spot on the face of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Such a man could scarcely be expected to make a newspaper, in a war like this, the exponent of humane policy, liberal sentiments, or chivalric ideas. --Moreover, <persName n="Raymond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Raymond,nomatch:0"><surname>Raymond</surname></persName> has got into his head, not capable in its best estate of holding many ideas, the amazing conception that he is a military genius, a delusion which led him to <placeName key="tgn,7005898" n="1.000 10" reg="Solferino,Mantova,Lombardia,Italia,Europe">Solferino</placeName>, whence he intended to write thundering military letters to the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> but was cured of his folly for the time by the sight of an actual battle, which set him to running at such a rate that it is doubtful whether, but for the ridicule of the world, he would have stopped by this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>In the beginning of the present war, he dabbled again in the art military, confining himself for a time to military criticism, in which he showed how the war ought to be carried on, in order to make it successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>He pointed out that <q> &#x0022;<num value="2">two</num> well equipped armies, consisting each of <num value="25000">25,000</num> men, <num value="1">one</num> marching from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the other from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> might easily reduce <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>He patronized <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Ann,,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> considerably, gave other <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> an occasional nod or hint, and, in short, contributed a good deal to the information of the volunteers and the amusement of the regular officers, who have an idea that newspaper editors know as much about the managing of an army as officers do about editing a newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Nevertheless, although <persName n="Raymond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Raymond,nomatch:0"><surname>Raymond</surname></persName> is as vindictive as a <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs>, and has made himself very disgusting by his pretensions to military knowledge, he has had the candor on several occasions to admit the defeats of his countrymen, and we award him credit accordingly. </p>

The war made him no worse than he ever was, only, like the <name>Day</name> of Judgment, it has stripped off his disguises as it has a good many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>He was a great friend of the <rs>South</rs>, but never, that we have heard of, from any motive but the interests of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It could not be expected that such a man as <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> should ever be governed by any but mercenary considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>These had been the only principles ever recognized in the management of his paper from its foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Black-balling private character, ridiculing religion, defaming virtue, pandering to the grossest licentiousness, it had grown rich, to rank luxuriance, upon the sorrows and the vices of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>We are not surprised that he has led the <rs>Northern</rs> mob in whooping and howling for Southern blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>There was the blood of a multitude of souls, demoralized by his influence, on his guilty head before this war began, and the blood of the battle field cannot add a deeper crimson to his crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>And yet, infamous as the man individually is it may be doubted whether the influence of his paper has equalled that of some others of the <rs>Northern</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The conversion of the creature was too sudden, his professions too uproarious, his lies too shameless, to command the entire confidence of his new friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>He predicts now that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> will have <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, and says that by next <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> the whole Southern country will be occupied by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, and the <rs>Union</rs> triumphantly reconstructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It is not wonderful that the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> has no believers, least of all those who are its own editors and conductors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> It may be said, however, both of <placeName reg="Raymond, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057320">Raymond</placeName> and <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName>, as it cannot be said of <persName n="Prentice,,George,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="default:Prentice,George,D.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Prentice</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Louisville Journal" type="newspaper">Louisville <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName>, that they are true to the section in which they live and from which they derive their patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The men of Northern birth in the <rs>South</rs> are generally among the most patriotic and faithful of our people, and it is natural that they should be so, because they have voluntarily made the <rs>South</rs> their home, and where a man's permanent home is there his heart is, if he has <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>But <persName n="Prentice,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="nearbymention:Prentice,George,D.,,"><surname>Prentice</surname></persName> has turned his fangs like a viper against the bosom which warmed him into life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>He has exerted all his talents, which are not inconsiderable, to bring <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> into a position of opposition to her own flesh and blood, to her ancient character and traditions as a generous and gallant people, and even to her material interests, which are all allied with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>He has sought to bring the <rs>State</rs> to his notions, instead of yielding himself to her principles, and has done more than any other man in <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 4" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName>, except <persName n="Crittenden,,John,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="default:Crittenden,John,J.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, not only to alienate her from the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, but to array her in arms against her Southern brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Although she is at last shaking off the incubus which his counsels have imposed, she might long ago, but for them, have been free and independent, and a powerful coadjutor in the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.--Corrupt morally and politically to the very core, there is no Northern editor who enjoys such a complete pre-eminency in infamy as <persName n="Prentice,,George,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="default:Prentice,George,D.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Prentice</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/> Having gone myself to the wounded <rs>Garibaldi</rs>, he declared to me that be felt no resentment to wards any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>On the contrary, he always avoided touching upon any subject of a political nature, and did not manifest towards the <rs>Government</rs> either hatred or opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>He adhered <unclear>tac tly</unclear> to the conditions I proposed, and demanded permission to embark in an English ship and leave the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>I replied that I would ask, and wait for instructions on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Having asked me what would be done with the prisoners, I replied that I was not the depository of the instructions of the <rs>Government</rs> but that, in my own opinion, the <rs>Government</rs>, after causing the prisoners to be sent to Messine, would perhaps get them at liberty within <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, in order not to be chargeable to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/> They agreed to surrender unconditionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>The General was conveyed, surrounded by his stuff and a number of his adherents, under the escort of the <orgName type="regiment" key="25Battalion">Twenty-fifth battalion</orgName> of <unclear>Ber gli </unclear> to a <unclear>con </unclear> called Marchesina where he passed the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Next day he was conducted to Seilla, to which I had <unclear>prov ded</unclear> him, and where I communicated to him the order of the <rs>Government</rs> to cause him to embark on board the <foreign lang="ita"><persName n="Genova,,Duca,di,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00409" reg="default:Genova,Duca,di,,"><foreName>Duca</foreName> <foreName>di</foreName> <surname>Genova</surname></persName>.</foreign> He reproached me <unclear></unclear> with not having kept my promise to allow him to embark in an English ship, and reminded me that I had said his adherents would be set at liberty in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> I then said with some heat, that I had never proposed anything in the name of the <rs>Government</rs>; that in relation to the embarkation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>I said that I would refer the matter to the <name>Ministry</name>, whose answer I had at that moment communicated to the <rs>General</rs>, that as to what related to the future disposition of the prisoners, I had only expressed my own personal opinion, which did not bind the <rs>Government</rs>, which had given no instruction upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>The reply to me was a request that, at a proper time, I might give expression to that hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>This I did not refuse to do, because it was in unison with my own personal opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> For the rest, as I have said above, <persName n="Garibaldi,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00410" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> always kept silence, and broke it only to address these words to the people of Seilla who happened to be in his way: <q>&#x0022;Do you no longer recognize me as your General?&#x0022;</q> No cry answered this appeal. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>I promised him to do so, but I added that I had no hopes of success, because I knew the severe instructions given with regard to them. </p>
