<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The importance of a distinct understanding on that point is all the greater in connexion with the stories which are afloat that the naval preparations of the hour are intended to afford the <rs>Federal Government</rs> the means of blockading the mouths of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, with the object of collecting the <rs>Federal</rs> revenue.--If anything is clearer than another, in the doubt and perplexity which prevail, it is that Government will do nothing whatever to precipitate a conflict.
