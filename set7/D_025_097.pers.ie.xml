<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Last night at about <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> the report of <num value="2">two</num> heavy guns, fired in rapid succession, was heard seaward in the direction of the <term type="ship">steam-frigate</term> <rs type="ship">New Ironsides</rs>. --These were followed almost immediately by repeated volleys of musketry, only the flashes of which could be seen through the darkness, lasting for the space of <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>--then all was silent; and speculation was rife on shore as to what it meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The &#x0022;long roll&#x0022; was sounded in the various camps, and each regiment was drawn up in line on the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName> was reinforced, orderlies were dispatched to <persName n="Wagner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Wagner,nomatch:0"><surname>Wagner</surname></persName> &mdash; the telegraph not being in working order &mdash; to learn if anything was known there, but, strange to say, neither officers nor garrison had heard a sound at all unusual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In vain did we look for signals; not a light appeared save those suspended on the rigging of the vessels off the coast.

<head>History of the affair.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> At <time value="9:30oclock">half-past 9 o'clock</time> of the night in question, the quartermaster on watch on board the new Ironsides reported to the officer of the deck a suspicious craft, with smokestack, and setting very low in the water, making directly toward the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The night, although clear and the sky studded with stars, was nevertheless unusually dark, and but little could be distinguished of the stranger except the smoke pipe and her low bull, the latter extremely indistinct; she appeared to be steaming at a speed of <num value="7">seven</num> knots an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>How she could have passed our picket boats was a question to be considered, for it was just possible she might belong to us, and to fire upon her without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> determining her character and intention might result in more serious damage than if she were an enemy; so she was allowed to come within hailing distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>More and more distinct she grew as she approached &mdash; a cigar-shaped hull, after the pattern of <persName n="Winans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Winans,nomatch:0"><surname>Winans</surname></persName>'s gunboat, driving before it through the water a smaller object, which could hardly be distinguished; a black smoke pipe, from which issued a thin cloud of black smoke, but no other indications of the motive power within, were visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Still she glided on, the object of her approach either the frigate itself or the <name>Devils</name> which lay moored on the port side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Coming near enough to hear she was hailed and ordered to stop, but she neither made reply or obeyed the summons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> All hands were piped to quarters; a gun was fired, but the curious craft sat too low in the water, and the ball passed over her. A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> shot followed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, with the same result; then a volley of musketry lighting up for a moment with a flash the steamer, the torpedo at her bows, and the figure of a man sitting astride of the garnisheed hull, engaged in steering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This man, whose name is <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, and who is now in irons on board the flag-ship, fired a shot in retaliation, which severely wounded <persName n="Howard,Ensign,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Howard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Ensign">Ensign</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, the officer of the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He pretends to have been sailing-master of the expedition, which he undoubtedly was, and is a man of moderate height, strong, muscular frame, a dark wrinkled skin, dark eyes, and coarse black hair and beard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There were <num value="3">three</num> others with him, all under command of <persName n="Glassell,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Glassell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Glassell</surname></persName>, formerly of the <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States Navy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He is said to be a man of superior talents and bravery, was captured some time since and confined in <placeName key="tgn,2335574" n="1.000 8" reg="fort warren, suffolk, massachusetts">Fort Warren</placeName>, but subsequently, on being released, rejoined the <rs>Southern</rs> army; he is now a prisoner on the <rs n="Ottawa" type="nativeamerican">Ottawa</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The musketry firing from the frigate after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volley became rapid and continuous, but seemed in no way to interfere with the execution of the plan had in view by those on board the steamer, as she approached nearer and nearer each moment to the <rs>Ironsides</rs>, her bow pointing toward the latter's side, and run close in under her guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>At this moment a terrific explosion took place, jarring the great iron-plated hull of the frigate, and sending into the air a huge column of water that fell in torrents all round, and entering the smoke-pipe of the little steamer immediately extinguished her fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When this had subsided, and the sea was again calm, nothing whatever was to be seen of her; the supposition is that she went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But struggling for life were <num value="2">two</num> men, evidently members of her crew, who were picked up by a boat lowered for the purpose from the <rs>Ironsides</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They are the <num value="2">two</num> I have already mentioned &mdash; the seaman <rs>Toombs</rs> and <persName n="Glassell,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Glassell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Glassell</surname></persName>; but neither of them can tell what happened in the time between the explosion of the torpedo and the moment they found themselves battling with the waves, or say confidently whether the steamer sunk or, rekindling her fires, moved off in the direction of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Damage sustained by the frigate.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Very little injury was done the <rs>Ironsides</rs>; in truth, I may say, with the exception of a few dints, no harm whatever was sustained by her. She is a noble ship, and worth all the monitors together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The prisoners state that the people of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> have very little faith in the capacity of the latter to reduce the fortifications leading to the harbor, but hold in great fear the terrible batteries of the New Ironsides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>To prove the endurance of the ship I would add that the shock she received was so severe that a huge chest was thrown from its place in the lower hold against <num value="1">one</num> of the stanchions, completely crushing the leg of a seaman who was unfortunate enough to be standing there.--<num value="20">Twenty</num> tons of water entered her decks. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>The origin of the expedition.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> This daring attempt, unprecedented in its boldness by anything which has happened during the war, had its origin in the city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, where the cost was raised by public subscription, some of the wealthiest citizens subscribing largely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The steamer was built there expressly for the purpose, the pattern of the <rs>Winan</rs>'s gunboat being adopted as the <num value="1">one</num> best suited for the accomplishment of the object they had in view, the material being of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The torpedo, which was of the largest size, and similar in shape somewhat to the steamer, was exploded by means of a percussion cap at the further end, <rs n="white lead" type="product">white lead</rs> being used to render it waterproof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Large rewards were to be paid the men in case they succeeded in their desperate enterprise and came off safe, they being sanguine of blowing up the frigate, but never expecting to escape with their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Both steamer and torpedo were towed as far as <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by another vessel; it was probably owing to this that they escaped the notice of our picket boats, these latter being engaged in watching the movements of the convoy, which steamed here and there on the water as if bound on a mission of mischief of her own before gliding back to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It is said to have had the very unusual effect of changing several votes which but for it would have been affirmative, and of fixing in the negative several others, which were considered doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>We know not how far this may be true; it is such an uncommon occurrence that we are disposed to be skeptical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Nevertheless, the speech was a very able <num value="1">one</num>, and was listened to with marked attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> <persName n="Christian,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Christian</surname></persName>, in the commencement of his speech, exposed the shallow assumption that the laws of political science did not apply to us, because we are blockaded and shut out from intercourse with the rest of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>He maintained that the laws of trade and currency were of universal application; in this Confederacy, thinly settled and struggling for its existence, as well as in the <rs>Empire</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, spreading from ocean to ocean, across <num value="2">two</num> continents, and embracing a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> part of the surface of the globe, and a <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> part of the inhabitants thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>He maintained that any departure therefrom would as surely bring disaster to the country making the experiment as disease would bring death upon the patient unless arrested in its course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It is refreshing to hear truth so well stated and so firmly maintained in the midst of so much false reasoning and so much senseless quackery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> The friends of this bill have been in the habit of arguing that because the impressment law has worked well, this law, which is impressment in another shape, must work well likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Persons who reason thus seem incapable of making a distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>If the impressment law works well, which, as it is at present administered, seems at least doubtful, it is because the interest of every citizen is involved in its success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Men will cheerfully give up to the <rs>Government</rs> everything they possess, when they know it is to be used for the defence of their lives, their homes, their all, against a cruel and vindictive enemy.--But they can see no justice in being compelled to make the like sacrifices, in favor of fellow-citizens who are not in the army, and do not contribute any more than themselves to the defence of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The feeling of the whole country is, everything for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The army must be fed and clothed, although it cost the last dollar we have upon earth; and, in that spirit and with that object in view, they overlook many things in the execution of the impressment law that might otherwise be objectionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>But the case is very different with an impressment law to feed and clothe persons who are not in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>They can see no reason why these persons should not be called on to make some sacrifice as well as they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Take an example furnished by <persName n="Christian,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Christian</surname></persName>: Cotton cloth is put down in the impressment schedule at <measure n="42cents" type="currency">42 cents</measure>. The same cloth sells in this city for <measure n="2.50dollars" type="currency">$2.50</measure> and costs the owner <measure n="1.50dollars" type="currency">$1.50</measure>. Here is a dead loss of <measure n="1.10dollars" type="currency">$1.10</measure> on the yard; and as the impressment of the article is very large, it is plain that the loss must be very great, unless it can be made up by sales to the people at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>These sales range from <measure n="2.50dollars" type="currency">$2.50</measure> to <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">$3</measure> per yard, obviously leaving but a reasonable profit.-- Now, if the bill before the <placeName key="tgn,2107582" n="1.000 2" reg="senate, jack, texas">Senate</placeName> pass into a law, and that law be applied to this branch of industry so as to reduce the current prices very considerably, it is obvious that the manufacture must be discontinued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Then what becomes of the mechanics engaged in it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>It is equally obvious that they must be thrown out of employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>There being no restriction in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, the manufacture will be transferred to that State, and the workmen will follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We have selected <num value="1">one</num> article in the schedule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The same remarks are applicable to all. By this Jaw we drive capital from the <rs>State</rs>, and labor and mechanical skill must follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The manufacturer cannot and will not make for the public the same sacrifice he has made for the <rs>Government</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The operation of the impressment law, which, although necessary, bears very severely upon the markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>So far as this city is concerned, the <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi> which the millers have established, and which seems to have entirely suspended the influx of wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>This law will cure none of these evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>On the contrary, it will render perpetual what is now but temporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It may be possible to fix a maximum with success upon the commodities now here; the commissioners may go to the grocer who has bacon for sale and put the price upon it; or to the <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry goods</rs> merchant, or the shoemaker, or the hatter, and do the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>If the man be refractory they can put him on oath, or call upon spies and informers to hand him over to the law. The goods he now has they can get; but he will be pretty certain not to lay in a fresh supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>And so it is in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The commissioners may go to the farmer and make him swear to his number of bushels or barrels, and they can set the price on them; but can they make him put another crop in the ground, or raise more hogs, or sheep, or cattle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>They may rip the goose, but can they make her lay any more golden eggs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>An army of spies and informers will traverse the country-- domiciliary visits will become universal &mdash; military force will soon be applied &mdash; the multiplication of oaths (in itself a great objection to any law requiring it) will lead to a multiplication of perjuries &mdash; hatred, ill will, and general dissatisfaction will ensue &mdash; frauds and evasions of the law will become common &mdash; and a general corruption of morals will be the inevitable consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>It is vain to say that these things cannot occur here, because our people are too moral to endure them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Our people are men, and human nature is the same everywhere and in all time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>What has happened elsewhere will happen here under the same circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>If our people are a moral people now, we are taking the very means to make them the opposite to this. &#x0022;Lead us not into temptation&#x0022;was the prayer of Him who, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> alone of all men that ever existed, understood the nature of the frail beings whose form he put on. <persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName> legislators have always carefully avoided laws which lead to a multiplication of oaths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>This bill encourages all the evils which it should be the care of the legislator to suppress as far as possible &mdash; hatred, malice, perjury, fraud, violence, and murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Well was it likened by <persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> to the box of <persName n="Pandora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Pandora,nomatch:0"><surname>Pandora</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> P. S.--A test vote was taken yesterday on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> clause of the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It was rejected by a large majority.
