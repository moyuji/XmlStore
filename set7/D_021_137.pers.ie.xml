<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Among the numerous private letters found on the field after the battle of the &#x0022;<placeName reg="Seven Pines, Carroll, Mississippi" key="tgn,2653139">Seven Pines</placeName>,&#x0022; are <unclear></unclear> that serve to illustrate the ignorance and beastly propensities of the writers, but we occasionally come across <num value="1">one</num> exhibiting a practical view of affairs that renders its publication a matter of interest to the <rs>Northern</rs> reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The following extracts are taken from a letter written by a young man in <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Alleghany, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburgh, Pa.</placeName> (<date value="05- 23">May 23d.</date>) to his taker, <persName n="Alen,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Alen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Alen</surname></persName>'r <persName n="Hay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hay,nomatch:0"><surname>Hay</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="61PARegiment">61st Pennsylvania regiment</orgName>, <persName n="Keyes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Keyes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Keyes</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">corps<unclear>d'er</unclear></hi>--Should his sentiments by any accident ever be subjected to perusal at the <rs>North</rs>, there is reason to believe that the author would be arrested on the charge of treason: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> * * * * From what we can learn, it looks as though the rebellion was about &#x0022;played out. &#x0022; At every point they have been beaten, and for some months past they have not gained anything of particular or lasting benefit, while we have steadily advanced, sweeping everything before us, taking New Orleans and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, besides numerous minor points, and a well founded expectation of being victorious at the impending battles near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 12" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But we must not underrate our foe. We cannot disguise the fact that <unclear> ers</unclear> is a powerful enemy before us, <hi rend="italics">ready and able to fight.</hi> Their soldiers are of the same stock as ours, and are as <hi rend="italics">brave and school</hi> their officers were educated at the same school, and are as talented and able as <unclear></unclear> and we have found out that they have as <unclear> any</unclear> and as good guns and munitions of war as we have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>I have been disgusted with the letter-writers from the army, <unclear> ing</unclear> <unclear> caustically</unclear> of the rebels &#x0022;dying <unclear></unclear> the last ditch,&#x0022; and making fan of the rebel <rs>Generals</rs>, though some times <unclear></unclear> was rather &#x0022; <unclear></unclear> fetched,&#x0022; and often it happens &#x0022;you can't see it.&#x0022; The rebels have fought us many a lesson it would be well to heed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They started into this rebellion without counting the fearful cost, and have sacrificed everything on the after of their country; have <hi rend="italics">been for more than a year on, I may say, half <unclear>rettous, </unclear></hi> suffering defeat, often and heavy yet with praiseworthy forbearance and fortitude have pushed on with their <num value="1">one</num> and <unclear> e</unclear> end in view--<hi rend="italics"><unclear></unclear> obtain their independence.</hi> I do not write this to excuse the rebels &mdash; for I believe if ever a rebellion was unnecessary it is this but to show the difference between the <unclear></unclear> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>When we were defeated at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, that <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, you remember what a sensation it created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>You would have thought we were all doomed &mdash; stocks down, business dull, but long faces everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><hi rend="italics">Every engagement we are <unclear> perted</unclear>--eye, it is demanded &mdash; that we be victorious,</hi> and unless we are you would think that is the last effort we are capable of making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Oh, that our people <hi rend="italics">had a little moral courage, like <unclear> </unclear> foes</hi> to beat up against misfortune. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> In some places, and often, the rebels have shown superior generalship to our own. Every person knows that a retreat is the last resort of a General, for he is exposed to the <unclear> </unclear> of his enemy without being able to return it. But when a General can withdraw his army, with all his baggage and munitions, and destroy all his works, while in sight of a superior forces of the enemy, does he not display transcendent military ability?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This we all know, was done at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Again at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> he withdrew his forces from before our best and favorite General, being compelled to meet us but once, at <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg Landing</placeName> <hi rend="italics">if we had <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> on our side, we would have been <unclear> </unclear> Memphis to-day, and the whole <placeName reg="Mississippi, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> <unclear></unclear></hi> I have no fear of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I believe the &#x0022;Union will be pretravel,&#x0022; but <unclear></unclear> will not be so easy as we might be led to expect. * * * &#x0022;He generous to a fallen foe,&#x0022; is my motto. * * *. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> I see by the papers that <persName n="Campbell,Colonel,David,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Campbell,David,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>David</foreName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName> has been appointed <rs type="role" reg="Military-Governor">Military Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg, Va.</placeName> He is looking up. But may be that will suit him better, as he will not get into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Some of these Colonnia and <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> will serve the country better that way than by murdering our soldiers in battle by <hi rend="italics">incapacity.</hi> A title is empty honor, unless accompanied by merit, and benefits neither the <num value="1">one</num> that bears it for the country that bestows it. True worth may be trampled and crushed, but will live and sneak for itself and be heard. * * * * * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Did you get anything at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> that the rebels left?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We would like something &#x0022;secesh&#x0022; to keep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He says he went into this war as a family affair, to serve his country, but he finds it is only those who <unclear> eve </unclear> and <unclear> teat</unclear> can get along.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> The state of <unclear>susper s </unclear> and deep anxiety of the public mind at the present moment, to learn the condition of affairs at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, leads us to give our speculations as to what will probably be the result of the course and policy of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> From our knowledge of affairs at that point, we are led to believe that it was the policy of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to have brought on a decisive battle with the enemy before he could have fort fled his positions and entrenched himself so as to cover a disastrous defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We know that he has been working with the pick and spade night and day for weeks, and it may be that the opportunity so eagerly sought for of making a successful attack upon him has passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>If this be so, to risk a battle under these circumstances would be productive of no final results, and only be attended with great slaughter of human life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>With this view, as we gaze on the great chess board of the present contest, it strikes us that it would be the policy of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to fall back from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> by retrograde movement, force his enemy to leave his works, and advance to the plains beyond the woods and hills of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, where he could no longer receive their protection and the advantage of his fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The Federals have over and over again expressed their fears that we might fall back from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, and their great dread of being forced to follow us further South, which they say they have a greater horror of than a battle. </p> </q><bibl n="The Mobile Advertiser"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> There are other considerations well known to many of our readers, and not necessary to particularize, which render our longer occupation of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> a matter of at least doubtful expediency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>But of this our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are the best judges, and we have confidence that they will decide wisely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> Under these circumstances, and from our knowledge of the fact that our army is prepared to make either a forward or retrograde movement, we shall not no surprised to heat at any moment either of a battle being fought, or of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> being evacuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>As for the defences of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, we know they are very strong, and that <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00486" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,H.,W.,,:1"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> with his host could never gain the rear of our battlements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>But this is not the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>We are not calculating the chances of our defeat, but those of a decisive, telling victory over the enemy, which shall secure to us not only a masterly triumph, but all the points and advantages of capture and conquest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> Let the public mind, then, be prepared for either event, and, come what may, let us only be the more firmly determined on our liberty and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If the order should be &#x0022;forward, &#x0022; the public heart would leap with joy and hope, because they would feel that such a movement would not be made without a fair prospect of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>So, on the other hand, the order to fall back from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> should be received, if regretfully, at least with the confidence that the good of the cause demands it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>The chief supply was obtained from the standing pools in the beds of <unclear> austed</unclear> streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Steps had been taken to bore a number of wells, but it was ascertained that there was no rope or tools to be had in the town, and that is would be necessary to send to <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus, Miss.</placeName>, for the particular kind of rope desired.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/> But it was not the want of an ample supply of water alone that rendered it proper for our army to retire from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Our encampment was bounded on <num value="3">three</num> sides by Bridge <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> and a dense swamp &mdash; in front, on the right, and in the rear &mdash; and our breast works were just behind the swamp, and <unclear>re parall </unclear> to it for a considerable distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>The swamp was crossed by <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> roads, near which we had planted formidable batteries to cut off all approach by the roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>It would now appear that the same thing has been done by the enemy, who has advanced up near the swamp on the other side, thrown up breastworks, and posted heavy siege gone, which not only command the roads leading cut from our side, but are of sufficient calibre to shell nearly every part of our encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Could we expect a different result, if we should attack <unclear></unclear> behind his formidable works and with his superior force?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>It was never intruded to allow him to approach so near and to get into position without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offering him battle.
