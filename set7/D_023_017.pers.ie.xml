<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Yesterday we gave a couple of extracts from editorials in the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>.

<head>Fighting in earnest &mdash; down with all traitors.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> This is the crisis of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is more than this it is the crisis of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There is no longer time for argument, indecision, or delay.--Every reasonable man has now arrived at the conclusion that the rebellion must be put down, and that it must be put down by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The repulse from before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is to this final act of the drama of rebellion what the surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was to its prologue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It closes the argument at once and forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>There is no time left for talking, and there is nothing left to say. Henceforth we must have only action, action, and again action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We are done playing with war, and must now fight a earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The order of the day is, down with all traitors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> This civil war has dragged its slow length along for <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure>. It could have been, and ought to have been, settled in half the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It has already cost the country <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The greater part of this immense sum has been wasted and stolen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Up to this date <dateStruct value="1000"><year reg="1000">thousands</year></dateStruct> of lives have been lost upon our battle-fields.--<num value="1000">Thousands</num> of these lives have been thrown away, unnecessarily sacrificed, wantonly squandered, heedlessly murdered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The bones of our dead soldiers would make a Golgotha monument higher than that of <placeName reg="Banker Hill">Banker Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The money already spent upon this war would have given competences to a <num value="1000000">million</num> of people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> In return for this immense outlay of blood and treasure, what have we gained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Are the rebels subdued?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On the contrary, they seem stronger than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Is the rebellion at its last gasp?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It has to-day more soldiers in the field than the <rs>Union</rs>.--Have we succeeded in reviving the <rs>Union</rs> feeling at the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Why, every day the <num value="2">two</num> sections drift farther and farther apart, every day we become more and more ignorant of the sentiments of the <rs>Southern</rs> people; every day that this accursed rebellion is permitted to continue, the number of <orgName n="Southern Union" type="union">Southern Union</orgName> men becomes less as the old Union seems more powerless and remote, and the new Confederacy more powerful and successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>What, then, have we gained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In spite of our brilliant victories, our naval superiority, our numerous but isolated triumphs, we have practically and in results gained very little and lost very much. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> What then, shall we do next?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Shall we give up the war, disband our army and navy, and let the rebels go in peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Never! It is too late to think of such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The recognition of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> by our own Government is no longer among the contingencies of this war. --The rebels may defeat our armies and capture our capital &mdash; these are possibilities &mdash; but the rebels can never conquer their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The conflict has assumed a new and a sublimer aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We have to decide now, not whether the rebels can be subdued, but whether the country is to be saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The question is no longer the putting down of the rebellion, but the salvation of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We are in <hi rend="italics">cul de <rs n="Sauk" type="nativeamerican">sac</rs>,</hi> from which our only escape is the suppression of the rebellion by force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> <measure n="15months" type="date">Fifteen months</measure> ago we might, perhaps, have peaceably divided the <rs>Union</rs>; but such a division is now utterly impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Later still, if there had been <num value="1">one</num> great statesman in the country, we might have reunited the nation by compromise, or by a diplomatic appeal to the old national feeling against a foreign foe; but now no compromise is possible, and the only diplomacy left us is that of the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Like <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, we cannot untie, and must cut, the <name>Gordian</name> knot of our affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Like C&#x00E6;sar, we have passed the <name>Rubicon</name>, and must advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Like <persName n="Carter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Carter,nomatch:0"><surname>Carter</surname></persName>, we have destroyed all means of retreat, and must fight the matter out. The crisis is no longer the comparatively insignificant affair of the secession of a few States, but it is the crisis of our national existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>What <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> suffered during her intestine conflicts; what <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> suffered during her revolutions; what <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> suffered during her civil wars, this republic is suffering now. From these cruel pangs we must emerge a great and united nation, or the hissing, the reproach, the scoff and the by-word of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If we succeed we shall rank the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> among nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>If we fail, Liberty is dead, and we die with her. But we shall not fail if from past experiences we learn the secret of success and prosecute the war with a united <name>North</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> Beg the question as you may, there can be no sane doubt but that the cause of our ill success thus far has been the want of unanimity in sentiment and action at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Those Abolition fanatics who adore the negro and despise the <rs>Union</rs> have distracted our counsels, impeded our armies, and neutralized our advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>To a strong but divided North we have had opposed a weaker but more united South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The result was certain; for unanimity is power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is now quite time that we had this power on our own side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The Abolitionists are the only faction which prevent this, and therefore prevent victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The Abolitionists in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, in Congress, in the press, in the pulpit, and upon the rostrum &mdash; the <name>Stantons</name>, the <name>Sumners</name>, the <name>Greeleys</name>, the <name>Cheevers</name>, and the <rs>Wendell Phillipses</rs> of the day &mdash; have hampered our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, divided our forces, discouraged recruiting, hindered enlistments, and endeavored to weaken public confidence in the <rs>President</rs>, in whom alone the people can now trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We urge, as a life and death necessity, that this disturbing and disorganizing faction should be put down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is the stumbling block in the path of the loyal people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It misrepresents this war for the <rs>Union</rs> by calling it a war for the negro; and no war for the negro can be popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It cries <q>&#x0022;emancipation&#x0022;</q> to drown the battle-cry of <q>&#x0022;Union.&#x0022;</q>--Its utterances serve to exasperate and encourage the rebels; for <orgName><persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Edwin,V.,,:1"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Greeley,nomatch:0"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, have brought <persName n="Jeff,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jeff,nomatch:0"><surname>Jeff</surname></persName>, <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> more and better recruits than the conscription act. It is a faction of traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>If it had been crushed months ago we should have had an end to the war, at half the price of blood and treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>As it is, the end seems no nearer than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><num value="300000">Three hundred thousand</num> men are now rushing to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><num value="300000">Three hundred thousand</num> more patriots offer their lives for the salvation of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/><num value="1000000">Millions</num> upon <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars are ready to be poured into the national Treasury by willing hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>We are proud of this popular, uncompromising devotion to the <rs>Union</rs>, but, taught by the lessons of past experience, we forewarn the <name>Administration</name> that this <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> apprising of the <rs>North</rs> will be in vain unless the people are united and the cause justified by the suppression of all factions, abolition or secession, which prefer the negro to the <rs>Union</rs>, and which by traitorous intrigues delay our arms, while prating about questions of slavery, which the war, if properly prosecuted, would settle for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Will the <name>Administration</name> be wise in time, or must we endure another year of war and debt before we learn (as we must ultimately learn) to fight in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Let but the <rs>Government</rs> strike <num value="1">one</num> blow at the abolition traitors and the rebellion will stagger with a mortal wound, while <num value="1000">thousands</num> of loyal but scrupulous men, who have been misled by Abolitionists, and now hold back, declining to fight for emancipation and amalgamation, will crowd our armies and carry the old flag triumphantly over the last strong-hold of rebellion. </p> </div4>

<p>the plan adopted for the obstruction of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> was by the secret erection of permanent batteries, to be afterwards mounted with heavy guns of long range, and by the use at present of batteries of <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>, mostly rifled guns, that can be moved from place to place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Several of these batteries are already in the course of erection at various commanding points on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, where they are completely concealed by the thick woods and bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>This dense foliage affords, also, complete concealment to the men who work on them, who have instructions, also, not to show themselves to any passing vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Sentries are stationed so as to give notice of the approach of vessels; and as the latter pass the men at work on the batteries suspend their labor if there is any danger of their being either seen or heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>When all the batteries are completed the trees and bushes in front of them will be cut down, and the river will be found to be closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It will be remembered that it was in this way that the batteries on the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac river</placeName> were erected last summer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>the importance of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to the rebels has been forcibly demonstrated by the events of the spring campaign, and hence the strenuous efforts which they will make to regain it. If they can restore there the <hi rend="italics">statu quo ante bellum,</hi> or even the <rs>State</rs> of affairs as they existed in <date value="1861-06">June, 1861,</date> they believe that we never again can invade that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Its capabilities for defence are superb; indeed, unequalled anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>And if, on the recurrence of the cool weather of the fall, we can be compelled to begin the campaign over again at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName> on the <rs>North</rs>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> on the southeast, the rebel leaders expect that we will find the road to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> still less practicable in fall than we found it in the spring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> such is their rather extensive programme for the summer campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The means at their command for its execution are rather inadequate; but they count upon the active assistance of both <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>He escaped and arrived in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, S. C.</placeName>, a few days ago. The narrative of his escape and adventures as communicated to the <orgName n="Charleston Courier" type="newspaper">Charleston <hi rend="italics">Courier</hi></orgName>, are very interesting: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> He was kept in close confinement until <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, a period of <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure>. On the <date value="03- 12">12th of March</date> some laborers being sent into the prison to ditch the prison grounds, <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> entered into conversation with them, and finding them Southern men in principle, informed them that he meditated an escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>They at once expressed their sympathies with his condition, and offered to assist him as far as lay in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He suggested as the most feasible plan a change of clothing in his barracks, substituting a laborer's suit for the uniform he then were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The laborer's suit was procured, the change made, and being furnished with a spade, he joined the laborers about half an hour before sunset, leaving the grounds with them at the hour of closing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Following his new companions to the tool house, he, with the rest, deposited his spade, passed on through the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> camp and outside of their pickets to the turnpike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The party there seated themselves on a lumber wagon used for bringing up the plank for the repair of the prison walls, and were taken to <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> Upon the arrival at <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the laborers, to avoid any suspicion, motioned <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> to follow him, and commenced talking very violently in the <rs>Celtic</rs> tongue, our friend apparently answering and nodding assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They passed on through <num value="1">one</num> of the principal streets, turned into an alley, and from thence to the cottage of the laborer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Here <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> remained until about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, when his friend told him that, as everything was them quiet, it might be unsafe for him to remain in the city, and it would be well for him to continue on his road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>His friend guided him through a back street to the turnpike, and accompanied him on his way to a plank road about a mile distant, where he gave the necessary directions, as to how he should proceed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> traveled all that day; but having just recovered from a severe attack of typhoid fever, he was unable to make any fast progress, and found that he only walked that day <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure>. Arriving, about half an hour before sunset, at a station called Louis Centre, and seeing an express train come up, he stepped into the car and took a seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Upon the conductor's asking him for a ticket, he replied he had none, but that he wished to go to <placeName reg="Sandusky, Erie, Ohio" key="tgn,7015315">Sandusky</placeName>, that he had but <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> with him and would ride as far as that would pay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> The conductor took his dollar and told him to get off at <placeName reg="Crystalline Station">Crystalline Station</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Walking on about a mile from this station, he stopped all night with a <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs>, and next day walked <measure n="7.5miles" type="distance">seven miles and a half</measure>, leaving upon an elder stick, being otherwise completely broken down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He stayed that night with a young man, who shared his supper with him, and the next morning again started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Coming across some laborers working on the railroad from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> to <persName n="Cleveland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Cleveland,nomatch:0"><surname>Cleveland</surname></persName>, he was asked as to his lameness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>He told them that he was a Canadian by birth, had emigrated to the southern part of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> just before the breaking out of the war, had taken the typhoid fever, which had fallen into his limbs and made him a cripple, and that he was endeavoring to get home to his friends in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.--<num value="1">One</num> of the laborers gave him <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>With only this in his pocket, he got aboard the next train, and told the conductor he wished to get to <placeName reg="Sandusky, Erie, Ohio" key="tgn,7015315">Sandusky</placeName>, but had only <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure>, with which he desired to go as far as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The conductor informed him where he would get off, but on arrival at the place and as he was about to leave the car, the conductor, seeing his condition, kindly told him to keep his seat, and that he would take him to <placeName reg="Sandusky, Erie, Ohio" key="tgn,7015315">Sandusky</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> He arrived in <placeName reg="Sandusky, Erie, Ohio" key="tgn,7015315">Sandusky</placeName> in the evening, without money, and in a state of starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>His only clothes were the laborer's suit, ragged and dirty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>A group of boys observing him, <num value="1">one</num> of them cried out, <q>&#x0022;I believe that fellow is an escaped prisoner.&#x0022;</q> Another responded, <q>&#x0022;Yes, I believe it is old <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> himself.&#x0022;</q> Hearing this he became excited, but seemingly paying no attention, forgot his lameness, and walked off as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Keeping on for about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, and finding no pursuit, the excitement subsided, and a reaction took place, and he was again as lame as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It was now raining, with hail and snow falling, and blowing a gale from the <rs>Northeast</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>With his thin, ragged clothing, for which he had exchanged his warm Southern uniform, it seemed as though every blast penetrated through him, and he was in danger of freezing to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Upon asking several to be allowed the privilege of staying all night, telling them his penniless condition, he was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Continuing his journey, he lost his way on a road that led off into a clearing instead of a farm-house, as he had supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Night came on, the rain still falling, with a cold, bitter wind piercing him through and through, almost depriving him of all sensibility of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>At times he would sink knee-deep in the swamp and mud, extricating himself only by creeping on his hands and knees. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> At another time he became lost in the forest, got entangled among the thorn thickets, and several times gave up in despair, submitting himself to fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Finding a box of matches in <num value="1">one</num> of his pockets, he determined on <num value="1">one</num> more effort, and getting a few dry chips, pulled off the bark of an old hollow tree and succeeded in starting a fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>By means of fence rails he was enabled to keep up this fire, and standing over it, managed to keep from freezing until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Although paralyzed in <unclear>mbs</unclear> and benumbed as he was, he succeeded in crossing another strip of woods, came up to a fence, and the welcome sight of a farm-house greeted his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Upon calling at the gate he was invited in and sat down to warm himself, but was compelled shortly after, from a sickening sensation, to go out on the porch for ventilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Upon his return, the farmer gave him a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> invitation to take breakfast with him, which he accepted with grateful thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The storm continued, and the farmer insisted upon his staying till it was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The farmer immediately recommended him to a neighbor who had been inquiring for laborers.

Here he disclosed his true character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The <rs>Irishman</rs> had been a day or <num value="2">two</num> before to <placeName reg="Sandusky, Erie, Ohio" key="tgn,7015315">Sandusky</placeName>, to collect some dues of a merchant, who it seems was an Abolitionist, and who he discovered, upon his arrival home, had defrauded him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> While <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> was there this man commenced cursing the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>He called them bloody <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> dogs, &#x0026;c., men who had robbed him ever since he came from the old country, and he wished the <rs>Confederates</rs> would cut them to pieces. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>He replied he would if it was anything honorable, if not he had better keep it. <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> then told him he was a Southerner and a military prisoner, endeavoring to make his way into <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The farmer grasped his hand, said his heart was with him, but that he was a poor man, not able to do much in the way of assisting him. He referred him, however, to a gentleman, the <num value="1">one</num> who had inquired for laborers, saying that he was a friend to the <rs>South</rs>, a good <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs> who expressed himself openly, was wealthy, and would, he felt assured, be glad to aid him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>He told him that he had been recommended to him to get work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>They reply was, that he had thought of hiring, but the weather being fine he thought, with the assistance of his boys, and money matters rather tight, he would be able to manage with what help he had. He asked <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> what he could do. The reply was, anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The proprietor scanned him very closely, and did not seem to like his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Seeing he was not likely to succeed, <persName n="Bramlet,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="nearbymention:Bramlet,William,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bramlet</surname></persName> revealed his true condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi>--<rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> mediation has been the only probable termination to this contest from its outbreak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The patience of those who have only to suffer was ever likely, to be sooner exhausted than passions continually excited by hope or stimulated by revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The Southern people may sustain and endure this contest for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, but <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/><num value="2">Two</num> reasons for a different view of its probable continuance have been relied upon by those who expected them to lay down their arms, even before a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> defeat on a field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Of these the theory of a moral collapse is quite disproved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Their firmness of purpose has been tested in many ways &mdash; by severe disappointments on the blockade question, the <rs>Trent</rs> incident, the power of cotton &mdash; by the surprise and capture of their greatest port &mdash; by great temptations wherever the <rs>Federal</rs> are in occupation; golden contracts or swift promotion &mdash; by a gloomy period of reverses, small but continuous and disheartening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>In the face of all these, and after a long term of privation, their spirit has evidently become more and more determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Clearly, then, we must abandon the expectation of an end to the contest in this way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> The other reason is of greater force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Many have inquired whence armies could be supplied with munitions of war if all the ports were occupied, and how any great community could exist without cities to dwell in. Up to the present time only <num value="2">two</num> important cities have been occupied; and if all the ports were captured, there are numerous towns in the interior, little known in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but sufficient for the need of defensive war. Few ever heard of <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,D.,L.,,:1"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> until its selection as the seat of Government, still fewer of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Towns were not plentiful when we took every important city on the coast, except <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and yet the colonists maintained the war. The question of supplies is far more difficult; but no blockade of <measure n="3500miles" type="distance">3,500 miles</measure> of coast can prevent the smuggling on a large scale of any article that is not of extreme bulk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>A glance at the map, showing the relation of the coast to <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, the <name>Bahamas</name>, and <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, is sufficient to prove that a supply of powder or arms is simply a matter of high cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The colonists maintained the struggle for more than <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, assisted, indeed, after a time, by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, but long under disadvantages far greater than those of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/><measure n="18months" type="date">Eighteen months</measure> have now elapsed since the movement began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Is there anything in the progress of the war or the present attitude of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies to permit any other than the conclusion that the struggle will be protracted for a number of years, if its continuance depend on Southern resistance? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> Nor can any <num value="1">one</num> believe that the powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will remain debarred from the chief material of their manufactures, practically a necessity of life, for a long series of years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The most malevolent enemy of that country could desire for it no greater evil than that free scope for devastation, bankruptcy, and vindictive passion, which is desired by those who are deemed its friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Your correspondent, writing from the midst of the elation at New York, has recently pointed out in your columns that nothing can save the country from ruin except the mediation of some <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> The principal objection to this now brought forward is that the people of the <rs>North</rs> are in a condition of mind so violent and incensed against this country that any action on our part would bring down alarming consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It is quite true that the <rs>North</rs> has a great number of men, great skill in organization, amazing energy, and little love for this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But as we have successfully encountered all these before, on a still greater scale, and wielded by a genius pre-eminent in war, as we did this with but half our present population and a tithe of our present resources, we may weight the subject without any manner of apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But let us admit the argument in its fullest force &mdash; admit that there are <num value="20000000">20 millions</num> of people having <num value="500000">500,000</num> men under arms, and very desirous to turn them against us on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>While we look on, suffer, and abstain, they will either be defeated or conquer the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>If defeated, their friends will have occasion to regret that mediation had not been offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>If successful, there will be <num value="800000">800,000</num> soldiers to find employment for, and with which to visit their displeasure upon us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> Another consequence will result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The feeling of the people of the <rs>South</rs> towards this country is at present <num value="1">one</num> of some soreness at the course we have taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Our motives are utterly incomprehensible to those who have been educated in the political school of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Still, speaking generally, there is under this a friendly feeling, which has the solid basis of commercial interests thoroughly in unison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>But if subdued, it is very probable that their animosity to the <rs>North</rs> would for a time expend itself upon us, after a manner often witnessed in domestic quarrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>They would vehemently assert that it was our truckling to the <rs>North</rs> which permitted a blockade of an entire coast to be ordained by a power which at the time could hardly muster a squadron of ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>To this they would attribute their ruin; and, however unjustly, looking simply to the fact, we may expect that under such circumstances the bitterness of their spirit would rival that of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Now, if the advocates of the drifting policy are alarmed at the vision of half an angry continent, surely a whole <num value="1">one</num> is a more formidable danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> fact has been plainly developed by the progress of this war for the consideration of statesmen, it is that the peace of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will be seriously endangered if that continent relapse into the power of a single Government, unrestrained, quarrelsome enough when a non military power, and now vain of its strength and afflicted with a passion for arms. --Surely the lovers of peace cannot shut their eyes to this, or wish us to leak into another Crimean war by forbidding that firmness which would have averted it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> And there is a form of mediation that would remove all risk of war. There are <num value="4">four</num> Western maritime Powers, and others would be willing to participate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The question is <num value="1">one</num> of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> interest, and if addressed by the general voice of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, speaking in the interest of humanity, industry, and peace, none are so excited as to disregard so irresistible a moral force, or so proud but they might yield to it without humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>All such combinations are cumbrous, and undesirable where active measures are intended, but these objections may be outweighed where it is hoped to attain the object by moral influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The principle of such a mediation is very apparent, and thoroughly <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The majority of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Powers, with the full sympathy of the <rs>Washington Government</rs>, have recently approved the action of people who have discarded old Governments under which they were miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It would be impossible for them to countenance the attempt to impose upon another people a yoke which they detest.--We, least of all, could deny to men of our own race the right we admit in other races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The Government of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would probably be willing that the consent or dissent of the people of the <rs>South</rs> should be tested, and would respect those principles which hitherto all <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> have revered.</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It is not at all a part of your policy that you should say, <q>&#x0022;I will only prepare myself for defence when I see an attack coming.&#x0022;</q> It ought to be the constant position of a country that wants to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors, and to hold that position in the world which its importance and dignity require, not to be prepared for aggression, but to be constantly in a state of sufficient defence.&#x0022; These are the words of the oldest, the most sagacious, the most popular of <name>British</name> statesmen &mdash; a man under whom I served my apprenticeship in politics &mdash; the ablest statesman in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, I may call him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/> We have just gained a series of brilliant victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Our enemy lies prostrate beneath the powered blows which we have inflicted upon him.--It is of the almost consequence to maintain the ground we have gained, and, of course, in order that we may do so, to retain our present force in full. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/> Under such circumstances, we appeal to the public to frown down those soldiers who have straggled from their colors, and care now wandering through the country, whose defence they have abandoned, and to whose cause they are a disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>We call upon all men, who love their country, and who desire to see it emerge from its present difficulties with honor, to unite in this duty of every patriot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Let them show the straggler no quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>Let their houses be closed against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Let them not approach their firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Let them be banished from their society, as foul and loathsome lepers, whose very breath is pestilence, whose lightest touch is contamination.--Turn your backs, fellow citizens, upon the wretches who desert their country in the hour of her peril &mdash; upon the coward who leaves his comrades to face the enemy in the field of battle, while he is skulking in safety &mdash; upon the villain who, for a mean of passage in willing to surrender, like <unclear></unclear> of old, the precious inheritance bequeathed to him by his fathers, and by them won on many a field of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>They are the truest of patriots, and though their physical strength be weak, their souls are infinitely stronger than those of the men. They all hate cowards and renegades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Let them show it in the plainest manner that they can possibly fall upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Let them not speak to or honor with so much as a look, (unless it be a look of contempt,) the recreant who skulks in the chimney corner when his country's banner is in the field, and his country's foe is striving to tear it down.--The country ewes a debt to its woman which it can never repay.
