<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Standing on the threshold of the new year, thoroughly imbued with love for our cause, and deeply anxious to contribute according to our humble mite whatever may lie in our power to insure its final success, we have determined, after much reflection, to present the following views, suggested by a sense of our future wants taken in connection with our past experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The present duration of the war, and the probability now recognized on all hands of its long continuance, admonish us clearly that it is our bounden duty to place the country upon a <hi rend="italics">war footing for the war.</hi> To do this successfully requires at our hands <num value="3">three</num> things--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, a sufficiency of men; secondly, a sufficiency of food; and thirdly, a healthy circulating medium for currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In the first place, then, we must have men to carry on the war &mdash; i. e., we must have strong battalions, capable of meeting and resisting the enemy's armed hosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>But, then, in turn, the question of numbers with us must be controlled by our ability to subsist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Our armies need recruiting, or rather the ranks of those in the field need filling up. How shall this be accomplished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>My answer is ready at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Bring back the absentees, of whom, I will venture, there is to-day not less than <num value="0.5">fifty per cent.</num> of this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>I have recently conversed with the commanders of <num value="3">three</num> different brigades on this important question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><num value="1">One</num> of them told me that in his brigade <num value="0.4">forty per cent.</num> were absent; another told me that in his brigade <num value="0.45">forty-five per cent.</num> were absent, another told me that in his brigade <num value="0.45">forty-five per cent.</num> were absent, and another <num value="0.5">fifty per cent.</num> Taking the mean of these <num value="3">three</num> statements as the average, it will appear that <num value="0.45">forty-five per cent</num> of this army is absents from it. The inquiry which very readily presents itself to every <num value="1">one</num> is, where are these men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I answer that they are at home, detailed as conscript catchers, provost guards, passport clerks, attaches to quartermasters, commissaries, and hospitals, and a very large class are hanging around loose on surgeons' certificates, whilst not a small class are absent without permission or excuse; and yet the names of these men are borne upon the muster rolls of honor of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Ought these things so to be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Can they not be remedied?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I believe they can. To begin; the present conscript organization of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> is a positive nuisance.--The men who are thus engaged so contrive that the duty of collecting conscripts shall be incidental to their private duties rather than the public business of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The sooner, then, all those who are thus engage shall be relieved and returned to their commands the better for the army and the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Return all the <name>Provost</name> guards to their several commands, and bring out the <num value="45">45</num> to <num value="50">50</num> class of men and give them this sort of duty to perform.--Improve our legislation so as to lessen the power of surgeons in granting and extending furloughs for sickness and disability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>This, however, looks to vigorous measures, measures calculated to operate upon the fears rather than appealing to the better qualities of men's natures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> There ought to be established at once by Congress a system of rewards for brave and meritorious acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A roll of honor, or some distinguishing badge, that would tell as the faithful soldier passed on the highways, &#x0022;there goes a soldier who, though clad in dingy garments and cutting but a poor figure in dress, has yet deserved well of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>In the camp, on the march, in the bivouac, or it may be when the battle has raged hottest and the missiles of death rained thickest.&#x0022;This army would be a new machine by the passage of such a law, and every man here would then exert himself to be a hero in the strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Shame upon Congress, that thus far there has been no such legislation, and eternal honor to our glorious dead who sleep in neglected private graves, and our brave and faithful soldiers that, though their country has never remembered them, yet that they have never forgotten or been recreant to their country. &#x0022;Better late than never,&#x0022; would be a good motto for Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Let them order from this time forth a system of rewards and medals, that when the strife of battle is o'er, the soldier, in his rags and his poverty, may point to the proofs of his patriotism and valor, and tell his children, though I leave you penniless in money, you are yet rich in the legacy of patriotic self-sacrifice which your ancestry endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>But I would go a step farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>There are in this army, I should suppose, not less than <num value="4000">four thousand</num> able-bodied white men, capable of making excellent soldiers, who are acting as teamsters and ambulance drivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Why cannot the places of these men be filled by colored persons and these whites restored to their commands for the duties of the field?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I am satisfied if these suggestions are observed, and the substitute law is rigidly enforced, that this <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName> will be strong enough in the coming spring for any work that it may be legitimately expected to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Officers who have served in the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">army of Tennessee</orgName> tell me that all I have said in this particular applies with equal force to that army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> I cannot believe that there is a necessity for taking the men above <num value="50">fifty</num>, or the boys under <num value="18">eighteen</num>, to swell the ranks of our regular army, because I am satisfied that the present conscript law, if properly enforced, will give us a sufficiency of men; and as for a &#x0022;reserved&#x0022; force, it means nothing else than harassing the people of the <rs>State</rs> without any practical good results, whilst the withdrawal of so large a force of labor, and superintendence of labor, at such a time as the planting season, may seriously impair our prospects for <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs> crops; and to take from the schools the boys under <num value="18">eighteen</num> will be practically to close the school-houses, and to bring up in grossest ignorance the rising generation &mdash; the future occupiers and rulers of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Another remark, and I have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><measure n="3years" type="date">Three years</measure> of this war are practically at an end, and we are stronger, relatively, <hi rend="italics">in men under arms,</hi> than we have ever been, whilst the <rs>North</rs> is <hi rend="italics">comparatively</hi> weaker in soldiers; but it cannot be denied, I think, that bread and meat is scarier than at the beginning of the war. Does not common sense, then, teach that we should husband our resources of men and stimulate production?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>This year may be the last of the war. If so, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> be praised and thanked; but, if it should not be, let us forecast and ask what must be our condition if a sweeping army bill is passed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Let us not, in a fit of passion, or in order to reach a few, so legislate as to injure the whole, but rather let us rely upon wise laws, and their right administration, sanctioned by Heaven for success, than to spasmodic and class legislation, to carry us through the perils that environ us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> <num value="1">One</num> word more and I have done, for I shall submit no observations on the currency for the reason that I am not enough of a financier to say anything that would be valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>That closing remark is this: I beg Congress to make no effort to disturb the present organization of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>If they should, my word for it, the consequences will be disastrously fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>In some instances, changes could be made for the better, but taken as a whole this army could not be better officered than it is.--My own impression is that, whilst a few discontented spirits here and there may desire a change, the army will be satisfied with its present organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The sooner Congress passes the military bill the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>It will end speculation as to its action, and all will know what they will have to rely upon. </p> <closer> <signed>X.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He tells me that the rebel <rs>Commissioner</rs> of Exchange, <persName n="Ould,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Ould,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>, insists that unless the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> give up all claims which they have made in behalf of their own soldiers who are prisoners of war, consent to sacrifice the colored soldiers, pass over their officers for punishment under a special law made for their punishment by the rebel Congress, and employ another <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioner</rs> of Exchange to represent the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, no exchange can be effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>This, you see, is pretty much as I have stated it on the authority of other sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The General thinks that there is but <num value="1">one</num> way to meet this new state of things, and that is by the sternest retaliate on. He secured at the threat hold out in <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s proclamation against himself and his officers, and declared that if a hair on the head of <num value="1">one</num> of his officers or soldiers be injured, except in just warfare, the day that is done shall be a day of sorrow and mourning for a men included in the so called &#x0022;<placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.&#x0022; He pronounced the interruption of the exchange on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, by the <rs>Richmond Cabt</rs> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> net, a fetch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He now thinks that our Government, having exhausted every form of appeal to the rebel Government to exchange prisoners whom they cannot save from starvation &mdash; a state of things which all writers on the usages and laws of nations declare to be just grounds for the men so held by an enemy to be liberated &mdash; there is nothing left to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> but to authorize that a sufficient number of rebel officers be placed under such keeping and be put upon such diet as shall in all respects correspond to the treatment, as to clothing, food and fuel, that our wretched men receive in the stench houses of the rebel capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I did not think the <rs>General</rs> in any degree excited, but he was emphatic in all that he said in regard to retaliation; and I think he but interests in all this nothing more than the common feeling of the whole army. </p> </q><bibl n="The correspondent"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The Confederates are courageous and determined, but gloomy, anxious, and careworn &mdash; all because they cannot look at upper money as it is looked at by their Northern neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>They have got the better basis of the <num value="2">two</num> for such financial operations, but it has not answered the same purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>In the <rs>South</rs> the artificial currency is exactly what we should expect it to be, and the <rs>South</rs> suffers accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Otherwise, it was never in a better plight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Its stores of provisions and material have greatly increased, its imports of foreign goods are large, its military credit is high, and its spirit, says our correspondent, is unchanged.-- &#x0022;Nevertheless,&#x0022; he adds, &#x0022;we are on the brink of a precipice.&#x0022; The precipice is financial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>When a woman going to market carries her money in a great wicker basket, and can bring back in her pocket-book the slice of meat representing the produce of the exchange it is certainly clear that &#x0022;something must be done.&#x0022; The Southerners have not the robust faith of the <name>Northerners</name>, and they must find a substitute for that valuable credulity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> It is, however, true that difficulties of this kind can never force into peace a people bent on war, and our Northern correspondent &mdash; who has, of course, less opportunity of scrutinising the finances of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> &mdash; resorts to other considerations as suggesting a possibility of compromise or concession on the part of the south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>He thinks that the guerilla operations of the <rs>Confederates</rs> have slackened, and that this relaxation is evidence against the likelihood of such warfare after organized resistance may have ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>On this speculation, however, we may remark that the organized resistance is as yet far too strong to admit of any conjectures as to the tactics which may succeed it.
