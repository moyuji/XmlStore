<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> The Conscript law, upon principles of public policy, grants exemption from military duty to tanners, shoemakers, and other mechanics. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> This privilege is allowed those useful members of society for the public good, not for the benefit of the mechanics themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>They derive great individual benefit from it, but the privilege is allowed for the public good alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>These exemptions are conditional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>If the privilege is abused the exemption is forfeited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The law allows those exempted a very liberal profit, <num value="0.75">75 per cent.</num> on the cost of production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The wants of the country are the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The rates fixed by these Commissioners for hides, leather, shoes, etc., are adopted as the basis of prices to be allowed, and are deemed fair for individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>If the <rs>Government</rs> allows <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> or <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per pound for leather, that must be the basis allowed for the shoemaker, upon which he is to calculate his profit as a manufacturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>If charges exceed the rates fixed by Government, this will be regarded as evidence of the abuse of the privilege of exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Where exemption has been granted, the right to revoke the exemption is clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> Some manufacturers refuse to sell their goods for money, and demand of the families of soldiers that they shall pay for their goods with provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>This will be regarded as a violation of the privilege of exemption, it being a disingenuous shift to obtain exorbitant rates and larger profits than the law allows.

<head>Following up.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> A great deal has been said in the course of this war about the failure of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to follow up their victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The Northern journals have been equally clamorous about similar shortcomings on the part of their own commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> critics have pointed out the same peculiarity in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The fact is undeniable that all the great battles of the war have been indecisive, but that fact may be accounted for without any imputation upon the skill of the <rs>Generals</rs> on either side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> It has been said that our officers have been educated under a peace establishment, and never accustomed, before the present war, to the handling of large bodies of troops.--The old <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName> did not <num value="20000">number twenty thousand</num> men. The military men of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have been familiarized for ages to the operations of armies as great as those which are now in operation in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.--Moreover, their facilities of transportation approach perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Long use has rendered every detail of their organization perfect and complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Besides, their rank and file are all mercenary soldiers, military machines whose discipline is of the most rigid character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Every arm of their service is perfect; their cavalry are always in force sufficient to charge an enemy, and follow up an advantage, and in every battle there is a strong reserve, which never takes part in the contest until the day is decided, and is then hurled relentlessly upon the retiring foe. We, in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, have been laboring from the beginning against disadvantages which will never be fully known till the war is ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>We have been deficient not only in numbers, but in munitions, whilst the volunteer character of our soldiery renders it impossible to enforce that rigid discipline which prevents men from straggling after a defeat, and from scattering themselves after a victory to secure the tempting spoils of the vanquished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> But the best reason of all for the difference in &#x0022;following up&#x0022; between <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> and <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> battles is, that in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> battles are fought upon a wide and level expanse of country, where the cavalry, whose business it is to cut to pieces the retreating foe, have full scope for their annihilating work, whereas the thing here is a physical impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The rugged and mountainous character of the regions in which most of our battles are fought, presents to a retreating army a series of defensible positions, which can be taken up at pleasure, <num value="1">one</num> after another, and forbids the use of cavalry except on a very limited scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The main reliance in following up must be cavalry, for foot soldiers have but little chance of overtaking foot soldiers, especially when the pursued have cast away the burthen of their arms and accoutrements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Our own infantry have driven the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> infantry further back than ever the infantry of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> drove an enemy.--But there have been few of our battle-fields in which cavalry could operate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>What chance was there for a cavalry pursuit at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, or <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Such facts as these explain the peculiarity of not &#x0022;following up&#x0022; in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, without the necessity of any reflection upon the military capacity of the commanders. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Financial condition of Yankeedom.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> We yesterday published an extract from a letter of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>, in which the following sentence occurred: &#x0022;I am in receipt of many letters, some from persons in high positions, telling me I had better have my army destroyed and the country filled up with the bodies of the soldiers than to remain inactive.&#x0022; This sentence is very significant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> It proves &mdash; what, indeed, may be gathered from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers &mdash; that there exists in the <rs>North</rs> a general belief that military success of a decisive character, and immediate, is an absolute necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It can be so for no other reason than that the <rs>State</rs> of the finances requires it. Before the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs> the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> and other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers, believing the success of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> absolutely certain, hesitated not to declare that it was absolutely necessary to secure the country from a general crash. --The cotton of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>--rated at <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500000barrels" type="mass">five hundred thousand bales</measure>--was expected to postpone the evil day. Unless that could be obtained, it was plainly intimated the end was near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/><persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> having been defeated, and the cotton not having been captured, the evil day was on the point of coming, when it was averted for a time by the defeat of <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>But for that defeat we have no doubt that it would have arrived before this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The eagerness of <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s correspondents &mdash; some of them, he tells us, men in high stations &mdash; to hasten his march, even at the cost of his entire army, proves the desperate straits to which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> finances must be reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>They look upon it as a gambling transaction, in which, if the cast be lost, all is lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Even at the hazard of destroying a whole army, the risk must be run. If the army gain, they fancy all is gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>If the army lose, all is lost, and so great is the ruin that the mere destruction of the army is hardly worth thinking of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> There are general circumstances, apart from this letter, which strengthen the evidence that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> finances are in a desperate condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>They have passed a law against the traffic in gold &mdash; that is to prevent the farther rise in that commodity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Now everybody knows that the appreciation of gold is but another name for the depreciation of currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Secondly, the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> has let out the secret, hitherto kept with much care, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> debt amounts to <num value="4000">four thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>--at least it says <num value="5000">five thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> is the sum of the <num value="2">two</num> debts Confederate and Federal, and everybody knows the <rs>Confederate</rs> debt does not reach a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Lastly, there is a great drain of specie from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> estimating that <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> have been exported from that country to <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> alone since this war began, and Yankeedom being fearfully indebted to <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>If our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> will only keep theirs from gaining any decided advantages this winter, we shall most probably see a crash in the spring. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
