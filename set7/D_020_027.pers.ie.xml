<head>Partition of territory in the Old Union.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the most surricing illustrations of the liberality of the <rs>South</rs> and its disposition to do more than justice in its relations with the free States under the old Union, and the most conclusive of all answers to the hypocritical outcry of Southern aggression upon the <rs>North</rs>; is found in the partition of territory, the rock upon which, after all the concessions that had been made by the <rs>South</rs>, the uncompromising spirit of the <rs>North</rs> broke the <rs>Union</rs> to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This declaration is amply supported by an appeal to facts and figures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> At the peace of <date value="1783">1783,</date> the territorial extent of the then <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was <num value="807678">807,678</num>, square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Of this, there were but <num value="169662">169,662</num> square miles entered within the limits of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, New York, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>; all the rest was slave territory, belonging to the <num value="6">six</num> Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The proportion of slave territory was therefore about <num value="4">four</num> square miles of the former to <num value="1">one</num> of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Let this fact be borne in mind, <hi rend="italics">the proportion of slave territory to free territory was about <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.</hi> Among the earliest acts of the <rs>Southern States</rs> were deeds of cession, by which they conveyed a large portion of their territory to the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, as is well known, ceded to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> the whole of her territory northwest of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>, by which the present States of <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName> and <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName> were given to free labor.--By the cession of this tract of slave territory, which contained <num value="239558">239,558</num> square miles, the proportion between free and slave territory was at once greatly changed; for the free territory which had before the cession been but <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num> <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num></hi> of the whole country, was by this voluntary act of a slave State, <hi rend="italics">increased to more than <num value="0.5">one-half</num>.</hi> The relative extent of the <num value="2">two</num> sections now stood thus: <placeName reg="Free, Benton, Indiana" key="tgn,2031892">Free territory</placeName>, <num value="409220">409,220</num> square miles; slave territory, <num value="398458">398,458</num> square miles.--Of the latter, the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> conveyed <placeName><distance reg="142856miles">142,856 miles</distance> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></placeName>, on condition that slavery should not be interfered with; and upon this condition it was accepted, and since that time have been created out of it the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Thus, it will be seen, that in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> partition of territory, it was freely and generously divided by the slave States with the free, the former giving up their preponderance of territory, and of their own accord putting the latter on an equality with them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Subsequently, large acquisitions of territory were obtained by the purchase of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and by the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>These, also, were slave territories when acquired, but they were divided in the same spirit, and with the utmost liberality to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <rs type="place">Louisiana territory</rs> contained <num value="1136496">1,136,496</num> square miles; <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, <num value="59218">59,218</num> square miles; <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <num value="274356">274,356</num> square miles &mdash; making, in all, <num value="1470120">1,470,120</num> square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Observe the proportion in which this was divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> were reserved to the slave States, making, together, <num value="333624">333,624</num> square miles, and by the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> a portion of the <rs>Louisiana</rs> purchase was left to the <rs>South</rs>, amounting to <num value="158896">158,896</num> square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Total to the <rs>South</rs>, <num value="492520">492,520</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>All the remainder, viz: <num value="977600">977,600</num> square miles, or nearly in the proportion of <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, were accorded to the free States!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Since that division, the only territory acquired was that under the treaty of peace after the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This contained <num value="665486">665,486</num> square miles, and was all free territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Of this, the <rs>North</rs> obtained the rich <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">State of California</placeName>, containing <num value="188981">188,981</num> square miles; <placeName reg="Utah, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName>, <num value="220196">220,196</num>--making a total of <num value="409177">409,177</num>, which the <rs>Northern States</rs> acquired from a war to which Southern treasure contributed the principal portion of the means, and Southern rebels contributed the largest number of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> remained, containing <num value="256309">256,309</num> square miles of not very desirable territory to any section; yet the <rs>North</rs>, after all the territory it had received and acquired, would not accord even this insignificant portion to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was slave territory, and it was not as much as the <rs>South</rs> was entitled to in proportion to numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Yet, this manifest measure of justice was denied, and <q>&#x0022;no compromise with an oppressive slave oligarchy,&#x0022;</q> was the cry &mdash; the cry of the wolf that accused the lamb of muddying the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The compromise of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Crittenden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Guthrie,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Guthrie,nomatch:0"><surname>Guthrie</surname></persName>,</hi> which would have divided the aggregate territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as follows: Free States, <num value="1995965">1,995,965</num> square miles; Slave States, <num value="1200711">1,200,711</num>, was scouted, and a temporary resolution in a miserable platform made to triumph over equity and the pacification of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> And now the section which has been built up by the <rs>South</rs>, which has been endowed by it with territories as well as commerce, is invading our borders with fire and sword to reduce the <rs>South</rs> itself to the condition of a territory! </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> The tale of death and agony which comes to us from innumerable sources, and depicts with such a horrible but graphic fidelity the condition of the battle-field on the afternoon of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, last, is touching and sorrowful to the last degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The heaps of ghastly bodies, rent and mutilated, or crushed into shapeless fragments beyond all recognition; the glazed eyes turned upward to the blue sky and the descending sun, the blood-bedabbled fields, and rocks, and high ways; the wounded, crimsoned ever with their own gore, crying piteously for water, yet finding no <num value="1">one</num> to quench their intolerable thirst; imploring help from their comrades, yet seeing them rush past, dear to the faltering accounts that appealed for assistance; the frightful panic and confusion; the roads literally choked up with an interacted mass of vehicles, of every description; the fields swarming with fugitives, and all the region, for miles a round, strewed thick with muskets, knapsack, blankets, coats, shoes, cast recklessly away by the panic stricken multitude during the progress of their flight &mdash; these incidents of the battle and of the retreat, all so terribly significant, all so painfully demonstrative of the actual horrors of civil war, and all brought so vividly before us, and so directly home to us, might well admonish the <name>Administration</name>, and its Northern backers to pause now, at the outset, and to profit by the fearful lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>But if it rest with them to sheath the sword and tender the olive branch, they will not do it. Their resolution is taken to fight the battle to the bitter end. Animated by that base species of pride which goes before destruction, they are bent upon making fresh efforts, to be followed up, as surely as night succeeds day, with new and still more grievous reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>They entered upon the war for the ostensible purpose of vindicating the <rs>Constitution</rs> and restoring the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they have deliberately violated &mdash; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> they have broken up past all reparation.

The sounds of weeping and wailing are heard in many a Northern house-hold; yet, in the midst of the mourning and wretchedness which the prime movers in this crusade against the <rs>South</rs> have brought upon their own people, the demand has gone forth for fresh victims for the sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The war is to be prosecuted anew and with a vigor intensified by the mortification of defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>There will be more talk of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs>; but the subterfuge is fast wearing out. The appeal is not now so much to be made to the patriotism of the <rs>Northern</rs> people as to their fanaticism &mdash; their prejudices and viler passions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The spirit of vindictiveness is to be aroused and brought into play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The Northern journals are, even now, at work to stimulate them to the highest pitch of ferocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>With mendacity rarely equalled, and certainly never surpassed, they are recounting stories of Southern barbarities reported to have been perpetrated upon the wounded after the late battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Wounded Fire Zouaves are said to have been cut into quarters; others, whilst lying upon the ground to have had their throats cut; men of other regiments are reported to have been pierced in a dozen places with <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs>, or placed against the trees and fired at for targets; whilst the heads of some of the dead or wounded are said to have been cut off and kicked about for foot balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Even the ambulances, it is charged, were attacked, and shells thrown into the hospital at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Every imaginable species of atrocity is imputed to the victors, and the malignant falsehoods are caught up with avidity, and disseminated with eagerness, for the express purpose of rousing, among the populace at the <rs>North</rs>, a storm of passion, and of provoking them to engage in a war of extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>These are the tales which are told by men, who left the field so early, or so hastily, that it is impossible they could have known what took place after the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops came upon the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>In the name of justice and of right, of civilization and of humanity, we solemnly protest against the circulation of these atrocious lies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Of all the wars that carry desolation in its train, civil war, even in its mildest aspect, is the most baneful; but when antagonism between men of the same race and lineage degenerates into the perpetration of barbarities that bring disgrace and humiliation upon the <rs>Christian</rs> name and upon a civilized people, the horrors of such a war are exasperated to their utmost pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>As the enemy's steamer bove fully into view, she shortened and furled all her sails and stood directly for the battery, under steam.--About this time, <orgName n="company"><persName n="Martin,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00472" reg="nearbymention:Martin,Roger,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>, which had arrived early in the morning, took up position behind the sandridge on our extreme right, in order to resist a landing should such have been attempted from the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Our</rs> gun was now brought to bear on her. Gracefully and majestically she passed the battery without firing a shot at it, much to our surprise, and showing that she had accepted our challenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Slowly she forced her way to the southward, till abreast of the light-house, which was below and on the right of us, when she rounded to and proceeded to take position opposite the &#x0022;<placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>, &#x0022; about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to the eastward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>We could now plainly perceive her to be a large <num value="3">three</num>-masted screw propeller, carrying <num value="3">three</num> guns on each side, and what we after wards ascertained to be a rifled cannon <num value="6">six</num>-pounder, &#x0022;forward and aft.&#x0022; We looked at each other as this formidable stranger rounded to, and then inquiringly at the commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>There he stood, serene and impassable, a fierce smile of bitter regret on his countenance that his vessel was so small, and in his eye a determination to give the &#x0022;big steamer&#x0022; a warm reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>We saw that we had before us hot work and plenty of it. As soon as she lost her headway after rounding to, the steamer opened the ball by sending a rifle shell whistling high over our hurricane deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>It was really a relief to us when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was fired, as we had been in momentary expectation of it for some time, and the suspense was horrible, especially to those of us who had never before tasted &#x0022;the fierce pleasures of war.&#x0022; The smoke from her gun had scarcely drifted astern of her, the echo had not ceased vibrating over the waters around, when the &#x0027;little <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>,&#x0027; the very impersonation of &#x0022;multum in parvo,&#x0022; replied most graciously and effectively to this courteous <name>Sunday</name> salutation of our huge friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>As the smoke of our gun cleared up, and we saw the water dashed up the sides of the steamer, a hearty cheer broke forth spontaneously from the entire crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The opinion of every <num value="1">one</num> on board of our steamer, whose position enabled them to judge correctly, was that our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot struck the enemy between her main and mizzen masts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>This opinion was confirmed afterwards by parties on shore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/> The enemy now opened on us with her forward rifled cannon, and round shot and shell from her side guns, and the action became general; but far above the deafening roar of cannon, the whistling of shot and the bursting of shell, the voice of our commander rang clearly and cheerfully, calling on the men to keep cool and do their work surely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Never did men behave better or more bravely; their working of the gun was beautiful, and as cool and steady as if going through the ordinary exercise for practice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/> The enemy's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot, as I have said, flew far above us, but with a queer hurtling, seething, very disagreeable, and tending much to disorder the nerves of <num value="1">one</num> who hears it for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> shots were much better, but still above; while every time that peculiar sound of the shot and shell became more disagreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>After exchanging several shots with us, the enemy, apparently satisfied with our performance, moved around and dropped farther to the southward of us, behind a large sand bank which hid all of her except a portion of her masts and completely prevented us from firing a shot at her, as at the highest elevation we could give our gun our shot would not clear the sand bank behind which, moreover, the soldiers as before mentioned lay, and over which, if we fired at all, we should have been compelled to shoot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>This was, to say the least of it a cowardly retreat, and as such a victory for us &mdash; she had the advantage of position at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, (to say nothing of her superior armament,) being higher than we. Not content with that she took a position from which she could easily rake us &#x0022;fore and aft&#x0022; without being harmed by us. From this new position the enemy fired <num value="4">four</num> shots--<num value="1">one</num> of them just missing our smoke stack, another passing between the smoke stack and mast, very close to the hurricane deck; <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> passing very near the boatswain's head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> shot, which together with the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> were fired as we were preparing to get out of their raking fire, passed in about <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> of the men heaving at the windlass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot from the new position satisfied our commander that they had gotten our range, and aware that we could by no possibility return their fire, the order to heave home the anchor was given, and slowly and sullenly the little <rs>Beaufort</rs> obeyed her helm, swung round, her head up stream, compelled to retire from an advantage cowardly taken, and which she could not have prevented or remedied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>To have remained longer under such circumstances would have exposed ourselves and boat to certain destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>We retired with our colors floating defiantly to the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>I should remark here as somewhat remarkable, that the enemy showed no colors during the entire engagement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> Thus you will perceive, that never in the manuals of naval history were there such terrible odds to contend with, and I may safely add, and never were odds more bravely encountered. </p> </q><bibl n=""></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>It seems really hard to apply such a term to men with whom we have long been on terms of social and political intimacy; but when men deliberately ignore and set aside all the rules of civilized life and the laws of honorable warfare, and descend to such deeds as would make any but a savage blush for shame, why should we not call men as well as things by their right names, and term them <q>&#x0022;barbarians? &#x0022;</q> Having already plundered nearly every house within their reach about <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00476" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, they have lately gone a step further in rascality, and have begun in earnest to destroy houses as well as furniture. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>However this may be, the schooner had scarcely received her cargo of valuables, when a strong force of armed men drove off the little crew of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> men, took possession of the vessel and started, probably, for <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>I therefore suggest, as there are so many applicants for work, and so little can be obtained, and the most needy are unable to buy a machine, that instead of the work being sent to a few by <hi rend="italics">cartlouds,</hi> that it be more equally distributed, and all given cut to females be made by hand. </p>

The former, if we may judge from the recent affair near <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> appeared to be <unclear></unclear> disciplined and <unclear></unclear> efficiently commanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>The regiments which were dispatched under the command of <persName n="Pierce,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00553" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> to attack the entrenched camp at <placeName reg="Great Bethel">Great Bethel</placeName>, were speedily repulsed, and, in the darkness of the night, fired upon each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>This disaster is attributed to the mismanagement of <persName n="Pierce,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00554" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, who, it is stated <q>&#x0022;lost his head,&#x0022;</q> or to the disinclination of the raw Northern levis to face masked batteries, and to stand <q>&#x0022;the galling fire of rifled cannon.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>In this country we know comparatively little or nothing of the organization of the <rs>Southern</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>We are obliged to form our conclusions from the not very trustworthy accounts with which the New York papers favor the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>It is, however, clear that both in the attack upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and in the recent affair at <placeName reg="Great Bethel">Great Bethel</placeName> the <name>Secessionists</name> were well provided with artillery, and that their troops were sufficiently well handled to secure success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>We suspect that the delay and hesitation which have marked the policy of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> are to be attributed mainly to the circumstance that <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00555" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Winfieldum,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, an able and experienced officer, knows that militia regiments cannot, in the short space of <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, be converted into well trained and efficient soldiers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>The Northern army appears to be in great want of officers, owing to the circumstance that the great majority of the officers of the regular army have thrown up their commissions to take service with the <rs>Southern Insurgents</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>Actual warfare, however, is a sharp, quick instructor, and the <rs>Northern</rs> population have only to initiate the energy and activity of the <rs>Southern</rs> insurgents, to learn those habits of discipline and to collect these resources upon which success depends quite as much as noon enduring courage and a good and righteous cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The <num value="2">two</num> armies were approaching each other, and the fight which seemed imminent at <placeName reg="Manassas Gap">Manassas Gap</placeName>, will, in all probability decide, not the late of the campaign, but whether the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>South</rs> is to be the invading party. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
