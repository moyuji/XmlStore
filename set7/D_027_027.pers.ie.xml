<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We are, moreover, rapidly acquiring that condition most favorable for ascension &mdash; lightness of body, freedom from fleshly solidity and ponderously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> war of starvation has reduced us all to a state of gauntness that foretokens a nation of skeletons; and <num value="1">one</num> day the well-fed hordes of Northern barbarians and plunderers will meet a Southern army of fleshless men, who will so resemble the escaped tenants of the graveyards that their adversaries, horror stricken, will deem the day of judgment come, and howling, abandon themselves to despair; for the enormities they, have done will make that day, <num value="1">one</num> of unimaginable wretchedness and misery to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Before an army of ghosts they could never stand; and it is plain, if we can get nothing to eat, to that pass we must come; for starve or not, we mean to resist.--Let, then, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> take no courage from the last of the dire auxiliaries they have conjured up from hell!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Even <hi rend="smallcaps">Famine</hi> we will endure rather than submit to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> domination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>We have, as already confessed, given strong proof of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>When standing by a brick wall he is ruddy, and when resting under the shade of a tree he is green!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Only think of all this, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and dance and shout over the poor Confederacy, reduced to skin and bones, and about to &#x0022;go up!&#x0022; The bare contemplation of this is enough to make the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> go mad with joy, and at once renew his thanks to his maker that he &#x0022;is not like other men;&#x0022; which he, nevertheless, cannot do with half the sincerity and emphasis with which &#x0022;other men&#x0022; do thank their <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that they are not like him! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>But it is just as well that we should encourage the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to believe that their scheme of starving the <rs>South</rs> is succeeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>They are continually felicitating themselves with the impression that it is. The demon who attempts to reduce his victim to submission by persecution, even to the extreme of starvation, and fails, suffers a mortification and wretchedness proportionate to the crucify and brutality of the means he had employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>So the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, when they find that all their villainies, all their horrid brutalities, were vainly exerted against the spirit, the valor, and loyalty of the <rs>South</rs>, will be driven to the deepest despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>We doubt whether their moral sentiments are sufficiently humane to make the feeling anything like remorse or repentance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>They will be chagrined and disappointed to a desperate degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>On a large scale, their feeling will be that of the sheep-stealer caught in the fold, with the sheep on his back: the annoyance, mortification, and shame of detection or defeat, but <hi rend="italics">no repentance.</hi> They will be ever ready to return to their evil practices (though, under adverse circumstances, they may even for swear them,) when the opportunity offers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They are ruthless and remorseless, and there is no hope for any <num value="1">one</num> in their power.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> The writer of these lines knew the deceased in intimately for <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure>, and during all that time not <num value="1">one</num> bitter thought or unkind word ever passed between us. Our friendship, though formed at school, where we were members of the same classes partook not of the instability of the majority of such intimacies, but instead of terminating with our school boy days, grew and strengthened with our years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Our school day life afforded me an excellent opportunity of studying thoroughly his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He possessed a quick and original mind, a generous heart, and an independent and fearless spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>I have never known <num value="1">one</num> of loftier principle or more noble affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>But it were vain to attempt to portray his many viragos. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> At the commencement of the war, although in delicate health, he was eager to take up arms in defence of our glorious old State, and volunteer in <num value="1">one</num> of the companies then being raised in our native town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>And it was not until he was told by his friends and physician that such a step on his part would be suicide, that he reluctantly relinquished the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>He remained in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> some <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> after the evacuation by our forces, when his noble and chivalrous nature could brook no longer the insults and degradation heaped upon her defenceless citizens by the hire ling soldiery of the enemy, and he resolved to make his escape and join our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He was twice fooled in this attempt, but on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> trial was more fortunate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> On his arrival at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, it was some time before his friends could persuade him not to join the army. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> He left us and went to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and while there accepts a position in the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>This never suited his restless and sensitive disposition, and he told me often that he could hot bear the thought of returning to &#x0022;<persName n="Haven,,Old Belie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="default:Haven,Old Belie,,,"><foreName>Old Belie</foreName> <surname>Haven</surname></persName>&#x0022; without having struck <num value="1">one</num> blow to avenge her. About <num value="1">one</num> year ago he was elected a Lieutenant in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Richmond</rs> local defence companies, and for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> preceding his death was actively engaged in the defence of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in the outer line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>As was feared by his friends, he could not stand the exposure incident to camp life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>He was taken ill; but, being the only officer with his company, would not leave it until disease had taken so strong a hold on his constitution that, when brought to the city, his condition was such as to preclude all hope of recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>He was told the nature of his disease, and from his bright, cheerful countenance, during the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> that he lingered, must have known that he was dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>He said once, when asked by his sister how he fell, &#x0022;It is all right; if I die, I will go to heaven, but I may not die yet.&#x0022; His last words, that could be distinguished, were, &#x0022;<persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, take me home.&#x0022; </p>
