<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The following account of the wreck and destruction of the <term type="ship">blockade runner</term> <rs type="ship">Vesta</rs> is taken from a letter written by our quondam correspondent &#x0022;Bohemian,&#x0022; who was a passenger on board upon his return from abroad: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, (<date value="01-03">Jan. 3d,</date>) was wearing rapidly away as we lay off the town of <placeName reg="Saint Georges, New Castle, Delaware" key="tgn,2018155">St. Georges</placeName>, steam was up, and everything in readiness for departure when the order should be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was a little after <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> before the anchor was weighed, but in a short time thereafter we passed along the town, winding among the little islands, down by the scowling black-mouthed guns of the fortress, straight through the narrow pass which opened out into the broad <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On we went over the heaving waves, farther and farther from the fast receding shores; dusky night-shadows gathered over the sea, deepening every moment, until the land grew dim and indistinct, and the &#x0022;still vexed Bermoothes&#x0022; was hidden from our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>When the stars come out there was nothing but sky and water; and then our &#x0022;homeward bound&#x0022; sea voyage was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> and nights of good sailing followed with scarcely a sail to turn us from the proper course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day out, however, our troubles began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The weather grew heavy, the sea rough, and several sail were seen and ran from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The next day, and the next, were both stormy, and the sun was not a moment visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We had then reached the cruising grounds and were chased here and there in every direction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The <rs>Vesta</rs> was a new iron steamer, with double engines and screw, well fitted up for blockade running, and had on board a valuable cargo belonging to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Under full steam she could make <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="14">fourteen</num> knots, and I am confident the latter speed was made for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> when chased by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>A sister ship to the <rs>Ceres</rs>, she was an admirable craft, and upon all occasions conducted herself with marked propriety, walking rapidly away from all strangers who offered any uncalled-for attentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><dateStruct value="-01-9"><day type="name">Saturday</day>, <month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="9">9th</day></dateStruct>, we had a serious chase, and were driven far to the southward before night came and gave us an opportunity of heading again towards the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This we expected to make before day &mdash; in time to run in under the guns of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> before it was light &mdash; but after running in till nearly sunrise no land appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We had gone too far during the chase to make the return distance in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Heading out again, we ran some half an hour, and then, no cruisers being in sight, the engines were stopped and the ship hove to. The sun came out and a chance offered to get our position, but the <rs>Captain</rs> was asleep, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> officer (Tickle) made an attempt with the sextant, but nothing definite came of it. It was supposed we were some <num value="5">five</num> and <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> off <placeName reg="Cape Lookout, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2220499">Cape Lookout</placeName>, but whether we were or not may be classed among &#x0022;historical doubts. &#x0022; Well, not to make my story too long, here we remained until about midday, when a steamer came in sight and immediately bore down upon us. Scarcely had we got under steam before <num value="2">two</num> more steamers had discovered us and joined in the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Of course we now had to run for it. It was impossible to go at full speed without showing a black cloud of smoke, and, as soon as this became visible, we had the whole blockading fleet down upon us. They sprang up upon every side, as if by magic, and in half an hour we were completely surrounded.--Capture seemed certain, and there was no chance of escape except to run the gauntlet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This was determined upon, and on we bowled straight through the fleet, <num value="11">eleven</num> steamers fast closing in upon us. <num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> ahead were running across our bows, trying to cut us off, as many more on either beam, bearing down upon us, and the rest coming up astern. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> At length they opened fire at a distance of nearly a mile, firing their bow guns, still keeping on their course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The shots fell all around us, but for a long time none struck the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Nearer and nearer they came, and then, when only half a mile away, <num value="2">two</num>, on the bows, veered around and gave us a broadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This was repeated every few moments, and this in reality proved the means of our escape; for the time lost in turning gave us the lead, and, slipping between the <num value="2">two</num> ahead, we ran the gauntlet of their fire, and in a short time every <num value="1">one</num> of them was left astern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The firing still continued, and <num value="1">one</num> shot passed through the ship, but doing little damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Dark came on, slowly enough it seemed to us, and finally we were hidden sufficiently to change the course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>All our pursuers passed by us, and, completely doubling on them, we turned as was supposed again towards <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It was a hot fire for a time, and for over <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> we were a target for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gunners.--<num value="87">Eighty-seven</num> shots were fired from all the ships, but, providentially, no <num value="1">one</num> on board was injured <persName n="Eustace,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Eustace,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Eustace</surname></persName> managed the ship well, and during the hottest fire ran up his flag to show defiance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Free once more, another attempt was made to run in; but now, I am sorry to say, our greatest trial came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><persName n="Eustace,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Eustace,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Eustace</surname></persName>, during the action, had visited the lockers a little too often, and just in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of our triumph became quite under the influence of drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The pilot, <persName n="Adkins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Adkins,nomatch:0"><surname>Adkins</surname></persName>, was very drunk, hopelessly so, and <persName n="Tickle,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Tickle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tickle</surname></persName>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> officer, completely stupefied with liquor.--It was a sad state of things, and in a short time thereafter occasioned the loss of the poor little <persName n="Vesta,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Vesta,nomatch:0"><surname>Vesta</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Putting the ship upon a course, the <rs>Captain</rs> sat in a chair upon the deck and slept for over an hour.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> &#x0022;To exhort to sacrifices,&#x0022; says <persName n="Burke,,Edmund,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="default:Burke,Edmund,,,"><foreName>Edmund</foreName> <surname>Burke</surname></persName>, &#x0022;to stimulate to exertion, to shame despondency, to divert from untimely concession, are stern and needful duties in gloomy times.&#x0022; Such, in the opinion of the great statesman, were the duties not only of every member of Parliament, but of all men, in all stations, during a period gloomy indeed, relatively to the times which had preceded it, but bright and unclouded compared to those upon which this generation and this country have fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Especially is it the duty of the public press at this moment, and above all of Congress, representing the whole people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, to stimulate exertion, shame despondency, and deter from untimely concession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Has this been done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>We very much fear that it has not. Of the press, being of that party ourselves, we shall say nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Of Congress it is our duty to speak more freely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> Congress has been in session nearly <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, and that in the midst of a crisis which, above all others that have yet fallen upon the country, most earnestly demands prompt and decided action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is perfectly well a ware of the mighty preparations which the enemy are making to take the field with an overwhelming force early in the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It is aware, as every man in the community is aware, that the object of the enemy is to destroy our liberties utterly &mdash; to reduce us to the condition of <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName> or any other country whose name is a bye-word for absolute subjection &mdash; to take everything in the world that we have &mdash; to leave us not a house to hide our heads, not a morsel to put into our mouths, not a shoe to our feet or a hat to our heads, not a rag to cover our nakedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>It cannot but know the fearful advantage which the enemy will gain by opening the campaign before we can be prepared to meet him. And yet, with these results and these consequences full in view, it has wasted the session in a manner disgraceful to legislation and appalling to those whose fate is so greatly dependent upon their action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The rage for &#x0022;talk&#x0022; was never so high, while the incentives to action were never so great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They have passed an act repealing the substitute law, and that, so far as the public defence is more directly concerned, is nearly all that they have done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> If this struggle for our liberties result disastrously, the blame will be that of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The country is fully able to meet and repel the enemy, great as his force already is, and mighty as are his preparations for increasing it. We are threatened on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It is time that our reinforcements were filling up the ranks of our battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It is time that stringent laws were passed for bringing back the deserters and stragglers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It is time, in a word, that we were preparing to our utmost ability to meet and beat back the enemy, who is moving heaven and earth to get ready for an advance before we are ready to meet him. And yet Congress is too busy talking to think of the public interest.--These things should all have been done before <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Not a moment of the precious time allowed by the intervention of a season which puts a temporary stop to all military movements should have been lost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> This passion for notoriety, indulging itself in speech-making, has been <num value="1">one</num> great cause of the uneasiness that seems to have, for a time, pervaded the country, but is now subsiding. &#x0022;An idle man's head,&#x0022; says the <rs>Spanish</rs> proverb, &#x0022;is the devil's workshop. &#x0022;--These Congressmen, having nothing else to do, or choosing not to do it if they had, have been raving and declaiming about the evil condition of the country until they almost began to believe what they said themselves, and induced large numbers of persons to believe it absolutely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It is from that source that the meat panic originated &mdash; a panic as disgraceful to those who made it as <num value="2">two</num> those who indulge in it. We are engaged on a desperate conflict, not only for our rights, but for our very existence, and we hear people who never suffered a day for the want of a meal in their lives, expressing a fear of famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>What is their idea of famine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Why, the not gorging <num value="3">three</num> times a day with as much meat as would feed a den of young lions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>And we are to put this in the scale against our liberties; nay, our lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Men who sit down here and do nothing are ready to give up as soon as the meat supply a cut off. Why, <placeName reg="Frederica, Kent, Delaware" key="tgn,2017884">Frederica</placeName> the <rs>Great</rs> and his whole army subsisted on potatoes for many months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/><num value="0.5">One-half</num> the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> laborers that come to this country hardly ever ate meat in their lives more than once a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Our brave soldiers have been living on half rations for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>And we, who are not fighting or doing anything else to help the cause, are frightened because meat promises to be a scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Suppose it should, are we to give up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>How much more meat are we to get from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> than we get now? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> The babbling in Congress has been intended, we know, for no such purpose as it has subserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Gentlemen only design to remove an obnoxious public officer, or oppose an Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>But in doing so they dispirit the people and create a distrust at a moment when all hearts should be resolute in the determination to conquer or die. In other respects, too, they cause infinite mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The debates in Congress have encouraged the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their inhuman cruelties to our prisoners, under the plea of retaliation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> It is our opinion that we are fully able to meet the enemy if Congress will only pass the necessary laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>If they do not do this shortly, however, our difficulties will be enlarged to such an extent that no man can see the way out of them. </p> </div3>
