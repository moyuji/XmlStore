<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>By the time the alarm had become general, and the fire apparatus had made its appearance, the destructive element had gotten such headway that it was found impossible to stay the ravages of the flames, and all the upper wood work of the boat was burned down to the water's edge, when the hull sunk into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>The fire was, no doubt, the work of design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>The boat had been lately only used occasionally for the transportation of men and army stores, and in that capacity was doing an immense amount of service to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>The Same spread so rapidly that several persons who were sleeping on the boat made very narrow escapes from drowning; <num value="1">one</num> gentleman escaped in nearly a nude state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>During the excitement a negro man fell from the wharf into the river and was drowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>His body was not recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>The boat had arrived from down the river about <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, and anchored at her wharf a short distance this side of the <rs>Sugar Refinery</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>There is a bare possibility of the calamity having been the result of accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>While the fire was raging, sparks from the burning steamer fell on the long shed used by the <rs type="place">Glen Cove</rs>, which, quickly igniting, set fire also to the sheds owned by the <orgName n="Baltimore Steamboat Company" type="company">Baltimore Steamboat Company</orgName>, all of which were consumed or rendered unfit for use. The roofs of several houses in <placeName key="tgn,2625188" n="1.000 10" reg="Rocketts, Henrico, Virginia">Rocketts</placeName> also took fire, but were put out in time to prevent any damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The <rs type="place">Glen Cove</rs> was about <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> old, a great favorite with the travelling public, being staunch and swift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>The destruction of the aft part of the boat is very thorough and complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>The hull, which is nearly submerged, will no doubt be raised in the course of the next week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>The boat cost originally, we presume, about <measure n="47000dollars" type="currency">$47,000</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/> While not charging the loss of the boat as positively due to the torch of the incendiary, the occurrence should be regarded by our people as a warning and as an incentive to increased vigilance to detect offenders, many of whom are no doubt in our midst, and are only deterred by their fears from committing the most horrible atrocities against the peace and good order of any Southern community. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/> The sovereign people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, unbiased, and by their own free cholic, have, by a majority of nearly <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> qualified voters, severed the ties that heretofore bound them to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and united this Commonwealth with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>That our people have the right <q>&#x0022;to institute a new Government, laying us foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness,&#x0022;</q> was proclaimed by our fathers, and it is a right which no freeman should ever relinquish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> has now, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time in her history, asserted this right, and it is the duty of every <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> to acknowledge her act when ratified by such a majority, and to give his willing co-operation to make good the declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>All her people have voted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Each has taken his chance to have his personal views represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>You, as well as the rest of the <rs>State</rs>, have cast your vote fairly, and the majority is against you. It is the duty of good citizens to yield to the will of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>The <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">bill of rights</rs> has proclaimed <q>&#x0022;that the people have a right to uniform government; and, therefore, that no government, separate from or independent of the government, of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> ought to be erected of established within the limits thereof&#x0022;</q> The majority, thus declared, therefore have a right to govern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>But, not withstanding this right, thus exercised, his been regarded by the people of all sections of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as undoubted and sacred, yet the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> now utterly denies it, and by the exercise of despotic power is endeavoring to coerce our people to abject submission to their authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>Can any true <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> refuse to render assistance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Men of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, I appeal to you, by all the considerations which have drawn us together as <num value="1">one</num> people heretofore, to rail, to the standard of the Old Dominion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>There may be traitors in the midst of you, who, for selfish ends, have turned against their mother, and would permit her to be ignominiously oppressed and degraded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>But I cannot, will not believe that a majority of you are not true sons, who will have your blood and your treasure for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/> I have sent for your protection such troops as the emergency enabled me to collect, in charge of a competent commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>I have ordered a large force to go to your aid, but I rely with the utmost confidence upon your own strong arms to rescue your <unclear>f</unclear> and altars from the pollution of a reckless and ruthless enemy.
