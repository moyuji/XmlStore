<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Early yesterday morning the city was rife with rumors to the effect that an engagement was progressing in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The non-arrival of the <rs>Fredericksburg</rs> train at the usual hour gave rise to hundreds of surmises, and of course multiplied the rumors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>On the arrival of that train at <time value="6pm">6 P. M.</time> the following facts were obtained: The enemy are reported to have crossed the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and yesterday morning in <num value="3">three</num> places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Those crossing at the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ford were reported to be within <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName></placeName> when the train left <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Hamilton's Crossing</placeName>, at <time value="2:30">half-past 2</time> P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Our scouts, who had been over the other side of the river, ascertained from citizens that the enemy went forward very reluctantly when ordered to advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Information was also brought down by passengers on the same train that the enemy were making a general advance along the entire lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We are disposed to believe, however, the movement is intended as a grand reconnaissance in force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> From the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> we have no material change to note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> In evacuating <placeName reg="Watha, Pender, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077105">Washington, North Carolina</placeName>, the enemy destroyed the fortifications and everything of value there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The evacuation commenced on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> last. </p> </div3>
