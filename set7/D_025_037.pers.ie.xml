<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>She had slain a wretch who had saturated the soil of her country with the blood of its noblest children &mdash; whose thirst for human gore was insatiable and unappeasable &mdash; who had proclaimed the horrible determination that <num value="300000">300,000</num> more heads should fall &mdash; who was an enemy alike to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> his country, and the human race &mdash; and who, she but too well knew, had unbounded power to execute his terrible threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>A brutal populace &mdash; degraded to the last degree by the libations of human blood which it quaffed as the thirsty man drinks water &mdash; regarded her as undergoing the last degree of disgrace because she was led to the guillotine in the dress of a criminal, and with her head shorn of the beautiful looks which had lately been its ornament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But the should of the heroic girl remained unshaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>She knew that the disgrace consisted not in the punishment but in the crime, and she felt that she had committed no crime in sacrificing herself for the benefit, of her country, and of all her countrymen and country women. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>These paltry souls could know nothing of the difference between crime and punishment; or, rather, they thought that crime was perfectly legitimate if it could escape punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They believed that the world would cease to sympathize with the hero as soon as it saw him in the garb of a criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This very deed, if he were not already damned in the eyes of all mankind except the detestable race of which he is the proper type and fitting ruler, would cause the name of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to become a hissing and a reproach to all the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>We doubt if this result follows necessarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The complaint now is, that the monitors have been but of little service, and that the capture of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> is necessarily dependent upon the success of operations on land.
