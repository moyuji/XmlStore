<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> In answer, I have to say that having, at the beginning of my official term, expressed my intended policy as plainly as I was able, it is with deep regret and some mortification I now learn that there is great and injurious uncertainty in the public mind, as to what that policy is, and what course I intend to pursue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> Not having as yet seen occasion to change, it is now my purpose to pursue the course marked out in the <rs>Inaugural Address</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I commend a careful consideration of the whole document, as the best expression I can give of my purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>As I then and therein said, I now repeat: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> <q>&#x0022;The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the <rs>Government</rs>, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what is necessary for these objects there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> By the words <q>&#x0022;property and places belonging to the <rs>Government</rs>,&#x0022;</q> I chiefly allude to the military posts and property which were in the possession of the <rs>Government</rs> when it came to my hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> But if, as now appears to be true, in pursuit of a purpose to drive the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authority from these places, an unprovoked assault has been made upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, I shall hold myself at liberty to repossess, if I can, like places which had been seized before the <rs>Government</rs> was devolved upon me. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> I scarcely need to say that I consider the military posts and property situated within the <name>States</name> which claim to have seceded, as yet belonging to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as much as they did before the supposed secession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> Whatever else I may do for the purpose, I shall not attempt to collect the duties and imposts by any armed invasion of any part of the country &mdash; not meaning by this, however, that I may not land a force deemed necessary to relieve a fort upon the border of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> From the fact that I have quoted a part of the <rs>Inaugural Address</rs>, it must not be inferred that I repudiate any other part the whole of which I reaffirm, except so far as what I now say of the mails may be regarded as a modification. </p> </div3>
