I immediately went down, and saw liquor running from the store door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>A gentleman was sent around to the back alley, in the hotel yard, which is a few feet below the rear windows to <persName n="Edwards,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Overton,W.,,"><surname>Edwards</surname></persName>'s store, and a ladder put up against the window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The shutter to <num value="1">one</num> of the windows was opened, after which several gentlemen got into the store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>When I entered the store I saw burning candles scattered about the floor; they were <num value="7">seven</num> in number; also, loose paper strewed about the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The paper was saturated with whisky and twisted into ropes, and then had been trailed about the room in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The bung had been taken out of each barrel of liquor, and in the bung-holes hung the ends of this saturated paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The candles, which were about <measure n="1.5inch" type="distance">one inch and a half</measure> long, had been stuck upon pieces of wood, and around them were pieces of paper saturated with whisky, so that when the blaze burnt down to the paper the fire would have instantly spread in all parts of the room and communicated with the contents of the liquor barrels, thereby causing explosion and serious consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Soon after I got there, <persName n="Edwards,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Overton,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Edwards</surname></persName> was sent for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Myself and several other persons left them in the store, while we adjourned to the bar-room of the <rs>St. Charles</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Shortly afterwards <persName n="Edwards,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Overton,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Edwards</surname></persName> and his son came in and staid a short while, and then left for home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>While they were in the bar-room, <persName n="Edwards,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Overton,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Edwards</surname></persName> stated that he left his store that evening about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>, in company with his son, who was going off in the <rs>Fredericksburg</rs> cars at <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time>; he then retraced his steps and called by the <rs type="place">Exchange Hotel</rs>, where he remained a few minutes; from here he called by the store and looked in to see if all was right; and finding everything as he had left them, he walked up the street to <persName n="Lamb,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Lamb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>'s store, and from there went home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I think it would have taken at least <num value="0.5">a half</num>-hour for <num value="1">one</num> person to have completed the arrangements which were made for the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>When the parties mounted the ladder, the window shutter was unfastened and opened without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I certainly understood <persName n="Edwards,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Overton,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Edwards</surname></persName> to say that he went to the cars to see his son off, and am also positive that he told me it was <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> when he returned and examined his store, to see if all was right. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The Northern people, moreover, whose voices are, alone, potential at present, if we may judge from their journals, are nearly all in favor of war. This is <num value="1">one</num> side of the question. </p>

They will tolerate any government that will uphold the glory of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; they will submit to much tyranny and much misgovernment on the part of any such government, but they will not be governed by any man in the world who allows the honor of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to be tarnished in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Now, in the case before us, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> took advantage of the sectional war raging in this country to take possession of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, in direct defiance of the well-known policy of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>If there ever was a case in which a direct back-down would render a nation infamous in the eyes of all the world, this is the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The high spirit of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> could not endure it. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> would lose his crown did he attempt it &mdash; and that he knows but too well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Our own opinion is, that he will maintain the position he has assumed &mdash; that our own Government will maintain their's &mdash; and that war will follow, and that speedily. </p>
