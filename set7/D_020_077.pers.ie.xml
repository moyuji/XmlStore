<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><q>&#x0022;It varies in some places <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12cents" type="currency">twelve cents</measure> a bushel; in others, <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num>.&#x0022;</q> &#x0022;Very well; I will take as your standard the minimum <measure n="7cents" type="currency">price, seven cents</measure>. Now, as it would take too long to give you my secret, I prefer to reason with your official reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In the last report of <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, (<ref n="page 14">page 14</ref>,) <persName n="Cook,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Cook,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Cook</surname></persName>, appointed by <placeName reg="Syracuse, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName> itself, tells you that <hi rend="italics">about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the evaporating power is lost in the actual process of making salt.</hi>--Then you will understand that by controlling all the evaporating force of the sun and winds, you could have, as we have in the <rs>South</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, <num value="3">three</num> times more salt than is now made in your wooden vats, or the same quantity <num value="3">three</num> times cheaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Indeed, for the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> the <rs>French</rs> sea salt, per <num value="100">100</num> kilogrammes of <measure n="232l." type="pounds"><num value="232">232</num> pounds</measure> (<num value="4">4</num> bushels,) costs <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="9cents" type="currency">nine cents</measure>, or about <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure> per bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This fact is of public notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>By some new improvements in salt works which I introduced in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, I have produced the bushel for only <num value="1.5">one and a half</num> cent.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> Now, to come back to the salt works of <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">New York State</placeName>, every <num value="1">one</num> understands that, with a method producing <num value="3">three</num> times more salt, or the same quantity <num value="3">three</num> times cheaper, we can easily produce, not only in <placeName reg="Syracuse, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName>, but all along the <rs>Atlantic</rs> shores under the bright and glorious sun of the <rs>South</rs>, the bushel of salt for about <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure>, instead of <num value="7">seven</num> or a great deal more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> With a diminution of <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> per bushel, the total saving on <num value="6000000">six millions</num> bushels manufactured in <placeName reg="Syracuse, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName> would be yearly <measure n="300000dollars" type="currency">three hundred thousand dollars</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I take <measure n="22cents" type="currency">twenty-two cents</measure> as the average price of this salt, and suppose the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> production ready at <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure> per bushel, to compete against it, with an economic superiority of <measure n="20cents" type="currency">twenty cents</measure>.

Large and direct profit will, at the same time, derive to them from their new salt works near <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, or the entrance of <placeName reg="Savannah, Pearl River, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057439">Savannah river</placeName>; for the merchandize made from the sea-brine, and by natural evaporation, has always taken the lead of the market as the best kind of salt for curing beef, pork, cheese, and other provisions which constitute the wealth of the <rs>Western</rs> farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">State of Tennessee</placeName> will be certainly supplied in this way with the <rs>Atlantic</rs> salt from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> or <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, instead of the <rs type="place">Turk's Island</rs> salt, carried from New Orleans up the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>New Orleans itself, which is now importing yearly more than <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> of bushels, will retain, by a domestic manufacture of the article, all the profits of the foreign producers, and will increase yearly the wealth of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, by saving an importing sum of about <num value="1000000">one million</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> But these advantages are not to be compared to that of having indefinite quantities of salt at hand for agricultural purposes.--For manuring the cotton field, for instance, how many <num value="1000000">millions</num> of bushels could be sold at <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure>, as it is in <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Tabular views of hospital practice are here indeed vitiated by the fact that most of the soldiers who have died in the hospitals were allowed to lie in camp without such means and appliances as the sick require, until desperately ill or even in a dying condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>But the ladies must be seen at their own private hospitals, moving in their ministry of kindness about the sick bed, removing every annoyance, counseling in every affliction, reviving the tender memories of home, and recalling the vital power through the channels of social affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It is little to say that our soldiers are better lodged, better fed, better nursed every way, more comfortable in body in these neat and orderly places of personal devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Their physical advantages are but the accessories to the great social fact, that they constitute a ministry of the heart, and from their fountain life of religion re-establish the primal relations of mother and child, of the angelic life with humanity, in which woman resumes her mediators office between nature and man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> Besides the numbers mentioned as nursed by ladies in private hospitals, it is known that nearly every respectable family in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> has added to its ties of blood adoptive children of the army, and the convalescent from the hospitals are constantly taken to the homes of citizens, there to perfect their recovery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> Among the hospitals mentioned several must now be given up for school-rooms; but it remains with the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities to overrule the deplorable prejudice which has hitherto excluded from the general hospital this most precious and spontaneous order of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Many ladies are ready to engage in it, and to carry into our public institutions the beneficent spirit of their private establishments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> The ladies' hospitals in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> are adapted exclusively for the care of patients sick enough to be in bed. They are not hospitals for convalescents, and it would be absurd to hold them accountable for the deaths or accidents of retarded convalescence consequent on the imprudence of those who have been treated in them, and who may still use them as lodgings; but no allowance is made for this complication in the tabular estimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>These errors are wilful and regardless of admonitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>To soldiers who commit them, the camps afford no guarantee of safety, for there, as in the city, it is easy for those who have a little money at disposal to commit excesses or imprudence in diet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Besides, there are a <num value="100">hundred</num> pretexts habitually used for getting out of camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>It is only, then, by sending away the convalescent from all the hospitals in the city and camps daily, under guard, to the establishments prepared for their reception in the country, where it is comparatively easy to remove them from temptations, and where all healthful influences conspire, that the results of their previous good nursing can be sustained by the <num value="2">two</num>-fold intervention of families in the city and country adjacent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> It is also desirable that a patrol should be detailed to enforce discipline and prevent disorderly conduct at each of the larger hospitals, if not at all of them, both large and small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could then leave the hospital without a permit duly signed by the officer in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The <orgName n="Medical College" type="college">Medical College</orgName> Hospital especially has urged the expediency of this arrangement, which would sensibly reduce the table of deaths and also the term of convalescence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Camps which admit hucksters cannot profit by this sanitary patrol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/><num value="2">Two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the deaths in them are fairly attributable to imprudence in diet; the health of the survivors is gravely prejudiced by the same, and, beyond all question, the periods when temptations are strongest, and when it is most fatal to yield to them, are those of convalescence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>It is hoped that a cordial understanding will reign on this point, as on all others, between the citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, and that the wisdom of discipline will blend with the effusion of kind hearts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> It would be an extraordinary and intolerable abuse of vested authority, if in this war of our people, when every man's home is at stake, and every family has children in the army, the ladies were prevented, under pretext of military discipline, from taking care of their sick and wounded brothers.
