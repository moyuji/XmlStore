<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The city abounded with rumors yesterday, and everybody was asking his neighbor &#x0022;What's the news from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>?&#x0022; We give below such reliable accounts as we have been enabled to collect: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head><dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>'s battle near <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Early in the forenoon of Sunday our line of battle was formed <name>east</name> and <name>west</name> of the railroad and an advance ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The troops moved forward to the work before them in beautiful order and the best of spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They succeeded in driving the enemy out of their front lines of breastworks back upon their main line, capturing <measure n="300" type="prisoners">three hundred prisoners</measure>. Before the enemy were forced back they hotly contested the ground for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, but were finally compelled to yield to the heroic valor of our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In the meantime, a fierce artillery duel was in progress, the enemy throwing shell and canister at our ranks, and our batteries in the rear replying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is stated that in this contest <num value="1">one</num> of those cates trophies occurred which we have so frequently been called upon to record during this war, namely: that a number of our troops on a portion of the line were killed and wounded by the fire of our own batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The enemy's main works on the railroad being deemed too strong to attack, our forces held the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of entrenchments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Meanwhile an important movement was started towards the enemy's extreme left, about a mile west of the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A body of our troops, acting in conjunction with others, was sent down the <placeName reg="Vaughan, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120310">Vaughan</placeName> road, some <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles distant</measure> from the city, to reconnoitre the enemy's position in that direction and ascertain their strength there, with a view to further operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It was discovered that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had extended their lines west to the <placeName reg="Vaughan, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120310">Vaughan</placeName> road, in the direction of <placeName reg="Poplar Springs Church">Poplar Springs Church</placeName>, and were busily engaged in fortifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>An attempt to turn their flank proved unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Our troops carried their outer works, but the inner were found to be of such great strength, and so strongly defended by artillery, that their capture would have been a matter of great doubt without a fearful sacrifice of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The advantages gained were subsequently given up, and our loss at this point will probably reach several <num value="100">hundred</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> It was here that the gallant <persName n="Saunders,Brigadier-General,John,C.,C.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Saunders,John,C.,C.,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, was killed while leading his men in a charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName n="Saunders,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Saunders,John,C.,C.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName> has for some time past commanded <persName n="Wilcox,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Wilcox,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilcox</surname></persName>'s old <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> brigade, and in all the fights around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> has displayed the most conspicuous bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He was not more than <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> of age, and gave promise of a glorious and distinguished career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He was struck by a Minnie ball in the thigh, and the femoral artery severed, which produced such copious bleeding that he died before it could be checked. --<persName n="Lamar,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lamar,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, was also mortally wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> It is stated that in addition to the strong nature of the works on the enemy's left, which were assaulted by our flanking column, <num value="1">one</num> of the main causes of the repulse at that point was the giving way of a brigade at a very critical moment, which caused considerable confusion and gave the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> a great advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>After capturing a line of the enemy's skirmishers and reaching their strongest works our troops were compelled to retire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> A strong demonstration was made by the enemy on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> on our left, on the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 1473" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName> road, with a view of ascertaining the strength of our forces at that point.--For half an hour the firing of musketry and artillery was very rapid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>About the same time a heavy shelling was opened by the enemy all along the lines in <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>, but nothing was accomplished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> At night, as well as could be ascertained, the enemy's centre rested upon the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>, about <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>, their right extending across the wooded country to the <name>Jerusalem</name> plankroad on the east, and their left to the <placeName reg="Vaughan, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120310">Vaughan</placeName> road on the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Along this whole line they have strongly fortified themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In their rear, on the line of the railroad, and on both sides, they have thrown up heavy works as a protection against flank movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>At the <rs type="place">Yellow Tavern</rs> and the <rs type="place">Gurley House</rs>, batteries of heavy guns are planted, and at every point open to assault they are strongly fortified. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Warren,nomatch:0"><surname>Warren</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occupied the railroad, has been heavily reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The <orgName type="corps" n="corps 2">Second corps</orgName> (<persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s) and the <num value="9" type="ordinal">Ninth</num> (<persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s) have reached the road, and the enemy's entire force there now numbers in the aggregate full <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> While these movements have been in progress, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have given a share of their attention to the destruction of the railroad, and it is stated that the track is torn up to and beyond <orgName n="Reams Station" type="station">Reams's station</orgName>, <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles distant</distance> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Reports have been brought in that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry, under the notorious <rs>Speer</rs>, were engaged in destroying the track <placeName><distance reg="1mile">one mile</distance> beyond <placeName reg="Reams, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2113864">Reams</placeName></placeName>'s on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> All accounts agree that the fight was a heavy <num value="1">one</num>; but the battle for the possession of the railroad is yet to be fought, and the indications are that it will be attended by great slaughter on both sides. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> In the engagement of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, the enemy's loss in killed and wounded is represented to have been very heavy, besides the large number of prisoners captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We lost some prisoners and a considerable number wounded, but a small proportion killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="12VARegiment">Twelfth Virginia regiment</orgName> lost <measure n="6" type="killed">six killed</measure>, <measure n="29" type="wounded">twenty-nine wounded</measure> and <measure n="4" type="missing">four missing</measure>. Total, <num value="39">thirty-nine</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Passengers by the <rs>Petersburg</rs> train last evening represent that the affair of Sunday was much less disastrous than it was reported to have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Some say that our loss was not over <num value="700">seven hundred</num>, and the highest estimate that we heard was <num value="1000">one thousand</num>, killed, wounded and missing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The following are the casualties in <placeName reg="Braxton's Fredericksburg battery">Braxton's Fredericksburg battery</placeName>: Killed: <persName n="Taylor,Private,Bernard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Taylor,Bernard,,,"><roleName n="Private">Private</roleName> <foreName>Bernard</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>When General H. reached the works he found that <num value="1">one</num> of his colonels had surrendered his regiment, of his brigade, without consulting him.--At once repudiating the act of his subordinate, he ordered the men to fire and then to save themselves, his supports on the right and left having both long since fallen back.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> Some cavilling cities will doubtless take occasion to animadvert upon this failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>In order that the failure may be perfectly understood, I will give the reason which, in my judgment, led to it. In the first place, the enemy were present in overwhelmingly strong force when compared with our numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>In the second place, they were admirably posted and very strongly fortified artificially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>In the third place, to the eternal discredit of <num value="1">one</num> of our brigades, be it said that they broke and ran, and refused to be rallied by their gallant commander, though he did all that a man could do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Whose fault it was that these matters leaked out, I do not know; but I know that <measure n="18hours" type="date">eighteen hours</measure> before, the time, place and character of the fight were on the lips of all, soldiers and citizens.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> Your very kind and encouraging letter of the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="30">30th ultimo</day></dateStruct> was received yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>If it shall prove to be my happy fortune, through the <name>Divine</name> blessing, to contribute in any degree to the welfare of my country, I shall be more than compensated for all the labors and anxieties to which I have been appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Expressions of confidence and good will on the part of my fellow- citizens, such as you have been good enough to convey to me, are most grateful and encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>I regard the <name>Treasury</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as most peculiarly the treasury of the people, and there is nothing in the power of man that would so soon restore it to a condition of ease and prosperity as the universal and generous support of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>There is nothing in its present circumstances to inspire alarm; but, on the contrary, every motive for confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>An all-pervading cause of embarrassment and distress has been the character of our legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>However patriotically intended, it is not to be denied that the measures adopted by Congress for the reform of the currency had the unhappy effect of inspiring the public mind with feelings of fear and distrust as to the course that would ultimately be pursued in relation to that part of the public debt that is represented by the <name>Treasury</name> notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Apprehensions of ultimate repudiation crept, like an all pervading poison, into the minds of the people, and greatly circumscribed and diminished the purchasing power of the notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> There were many distinguished and patriotic men in Congress who earnestly believed that the great, if not the sole, evil of the currency was to be found in its redundancy alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>And reasoning from this premise, they interred that a corresponding reduction of this large volume of the purchasing medium would produce an immediate reduction in the price of all saleable commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Others entertained a different opinion, and believing that the purchasing power and value of these notes had a critical, and sensitive dependence upon the confidence and good will of those who were called upon to exchange their substance for them, insisted that a reduction of the quantity, by any measure that disturbed the confidence of the people in the good faith of the <rs>Government</rs>, would lead to universal distrust and still greater depreciation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> The majority was, unhappily, found to be of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opinion; and it must now be universally admitted, I think, that the policy that prevailed was erroneous, and the consequences precisely such as had been predicted by those who opposed it. The immense reduction effected by the tax of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent, levied upon the currency, and by the process of compulsory funding, produced very little effect upon the prices of commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Everybody regarded with distrust a new issue of notes of the same character as the last, and resting for their support as a circulating medium upon the same pledges which had ended in disappointment before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> That this is the true difficulty we have to encounter, I think every candid person must now allow, and I cannot refrain from indulging the hope that a new and sounder policy will govern our future legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The patriotism of Congress is not to be called in question, nor are we at liberty to doubt their willingness to renounce any policy that may be proven, by experience, to be erroneous and mischievous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Our people, at the same time, should not be silent, and in this respect the patriotic citizens of the great and suffering Commonwealth of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have set a noble example. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> On my arrival in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, I found that the commissioners of prices had fixed the schedule rates for wheat and corn at <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">thirty dollars</measure> and <measure n="24dollars" type="currency">twenty-four dollars</measure> per bushel, respectively, for the months of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The feeling of disappointment and alarm with which I was inspired by this circumstance you can easily imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>This painful feeling was, however, soon changed for <num value="1">one</num> of renewed confidence and hope by the farmers of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Public meetings were held in the agricultural counties and resolutions adopted, boldly avowing the impossibility of maintaining the public faith if the <rs>Government</rs> were forced by the people to pay such prices for supplies, and patriotically insisted upon a reduction of the standard rates and their establishment upon a basis sufficiently low to inspire confidence in the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The result was, that the commissioners re-assembled and reduced the schedule prices to <measure n="7.5dollars" type="currency">seven dollars and a half</measure> for wheat for the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> for <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>A wiser and more patriotic course was never pursued by any people, and I would respectfully appeal to you, as <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> of our gallant and patriotic State, to suggest and encourage similar meetings and resolutions on the part of our own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>I have an abiding confidence that a general and well-established belief in the intention of Congress, under no circumstances of temptation or trial, to shrink from the observance of the most rigid good faith in the money dealings of the <rs>Government</rs>, will enable us to overcome all our financial difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>That such is their real intention, I cannot doubt; but this determination should be encouraged and supported by the public declarations of our people, expressive of their own resolute will to foster the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> by the establishment of low prices and by the patriotic support of its treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Whatever differences of opinion may have existed in the past, or whatever errors may be supposed to have been committed, may now be buried in a common grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>We are making a new start in our finances, and under circumstances by no means unfavorable or discouraging. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> The expenditures of the <rs>Government</rs> are of <num value="2">two</num> classes; those incurred abroad and those incurred at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>In respect of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, there has hitherto been little embarrassment, nor is there any reason to expect greater difficulty in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Our foreign supplies will probably be procured without making any addition to the public debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The malice of our foes having raised the price of cotton to 30d. per pound in <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> markets, while the depreciation of our currency enables us at the same time to buy at home at less actually than 4d., it is plainly seen that it can be no difficult task to draw from our enemies, and from the complacent spectators of this atrocious war, the means of supplying all our foreign wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>This would leave us, then, only our domestic debt to deal with; and when it is considered that all that is asked of our people, and all that the <rs>Government</rs> is called upon to pay for, is simply their surplus productions, and their services in transportation and mechanical and other labors, who can doubt the ability of the people to bear this burthen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>If they gave all that is asked without compensation, they would give at best no more than their surplus, and would be no poorer for the gift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>How, then, can their condition be made worse by receiving the money and the bonds of the <rs>Government</rs> in place of receiving nothing? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> I hope, my dear sir, that you may agree with me in the opinions and sentiments I have expressed, and may join with me in the effort to give a new and generous impulse to the public sentiment upon this great topic of our national affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>I do not think that planters and farmers should alone be called upon to declare in favor of lower prices; manufacturers, railroad companies, and every great interest of the country, should contribute to this reform. --Let us content ourselves with more moderate prices and keep down the public debt; and not by extorting the highest prices, swell the public burthen and disturb our confidence in the virtue and the resources of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> <closer> <salute>I remain, dear sir, yours,</salute> <lb/> With great respect, <lb/> <signed><persName n="Trenholm,,G.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="default:Trenholm,G.,A.,,"><foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName>  <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>They are believed, for the most part, seldom or never to have bent a knee in adoration of their Creator; they would not only bend both knees, but would wallow in the mire, and kiss the feet of any successful invader, to preserve that which is more precious to them than honor and country, wife, children and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The phenomenon is easily explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>They have fixed their eyes and their affections upon the lands and wealth of the <rs>South</rs>; and they find it almost impossible to resign dreams so full of everything that is charming to the imagination of a people whose avarice is as boundless and as bottomless as the all-devouring pit of Tophet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The only way to disenchant them is to oppose a barrier of steel to the consummation of their wishes; to show a stern and unbending purpose to repel them at all hazards and at all times; to let them see that how great so ever the treasure the danger is greater still; to bring the flaming sword full in their view whenever their eyes wander to the <name>Paradise</name> beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Instead of doing this, we find persons in our midst crying out, &#x0022;armistice, armistice,&#x0022; thereby neutralising, in a moment, all that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Lee,N.,M.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his army have been doing for the last <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Is it that the new levy of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> may be thoroughly disciplined before it be brought into the field, and thereby be the better suited to his purpose of trampling out the life of our liberties?
