<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Thus far the calculation is not disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There has been no light in the <name>Heaven</name> in that quarter since he was banished, save <num value="1">one</num> brief display in <placeName key="tgn,7012924" n="1.000 259" reg="indianapolis, marion, indiana">Indianapolis</placeName>, which did not exhibit the deliberation and force of unterrified freemen aroused by a sense of outrage. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> This calculation would certainly be not unpractical or opposed to good judgment; for have not the <rs>Northern</rs> people submitted to every sort of outrage upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> and personal liberty, and arbitrary arrests without number?

<p>

<head>The retribution to come.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> In the dispensation of an all-wise Providence is ever that of national retribution. --Tradition, Bible history, profane history, all ages and all records, present for the contemplation of men, and, if they choose, for their benefit, examples of that inevitable retribution visited upon nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Amidst the diversified injuries and distresses which our ruthless invaders are bringing upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people, we may be assured the overflowing cup of bitterness will <num value="1">one</num> day be commended to their own lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There are at present at the <rs>North</rs> outgivings of discord, conflicting interests and opinions, governmental tyrannies, and popular impatience of restraint and oppression &mdash; all tending to collision and rupture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Such signs in any other nation would be more unmistakable, but even amongst <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> they may be leading to very natural and inevitable results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Whether they be or not, however, thus drifting we know that the retribution in store for those people must come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If these things are not now leading directly to it, the irresistible causes will soon appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If no nation can be saved from the wrath it has heaped up for itself, then the nation of the <rs>North</rs> has a day of terror before it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Whether or not the <rs>South</rs> may be able to carry the war into the enemy's country, nevertheless war at their own hearthstones, bloody and desolating war, is as certain as any future event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have steered clear of that calamity since the establishment of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Independence, (the last war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war leaving their own territory,) they cannot expect a long continuance of such good fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>No nation ever has escaped it, and least of all need a nation entertain the hope of it which is carrying on such a demoniac invasion as this of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><num value="1">One</num> of the reasons most urged by the <rs>North</rs> against &#x0022;disunion&#x0022; is that it will breed continual wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Do they expect to escape the common curse of humanity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Is the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to be the solitary spot on the globe, the single nation in all history, which has never known war at its own firesides?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Are they, above all, who are the most heartless and cruel of mankind, to avoid a doom which the most virtuous and valiant have been compelled to suffer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Let them not expect to triumph over destiny, and over the retribution which comes upon guilty nations as well as upon guilty men. The day will come when, either from a foreign invasion or war among themselves, they will suffer all and more than we have suffered; their young men will be slaughtered at their own thresholds; their women chased from the fires of their burning homes; their peaceful citizens shot down in their own dwellings; their fields laid waste; the roar of cannon and musketry ever ringing in their ears, and the wailing of bereaved households ever rising to the heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The present war but slightly touches their own sensibilities, for they care not for the slaughter of the foreigners, with whom they fill their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But <num value="1">one</num> day the curses which they are visiting upon this people will come home to roost in their own bosoms and gnaw their own vitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>A just and righteous <name n="God" type="God">God</name> rules the earth, who has warned the wicked not to exult because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily.
