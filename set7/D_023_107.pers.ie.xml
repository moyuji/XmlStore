<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> <measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> ago yesterday occurred the election of the man who was chosen to the <name>Presidency</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by a sectional vote, and who has ruled over the section by which he was chosen, but has not been able to extend his dominion over the <name>States</name> which disowned his authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>In these <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> have been crowded events which make them more than equal to a century of common life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The progress of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in population, wealth, and power, was often and justly boasted of in former days as the most rapid and wonderful in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>In the lifetime of a man it sprang to the front rank of the nations of the earth; but in less than the weaning time of a child it came to its end. Its descent was far more sudden and startling than its rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>If it <q>&#x0022;went up like the rocket, it came down like the stick.&#x0022;</q> If it exceeded all other nations in the quickness of its growth, none have equalled it in the suddenness of its downfall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>If it began with <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, it ended with <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> Let us see what <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has done for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and what he will do with <unclear> fore</unclear> he returns to his native obscurity in <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>He has completely revolutionized its Constitution, and blotted out every vestige of freedom in what are called <hi rend="italics">per excellence</hi> the free States.--He has established on the ruins of the great Republic a despotism only equalled &mdash; if that equals it &mdash; by the inexorable despotism of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>He has crowded dungeons with political prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>and accumulated a national debt of over a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>He has sent <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> of his miserable dupes to bloody graves in a land he has vainly sought to subjugate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>He has made the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> name a hissing bye word throughout the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>He has now resolved to extend martial law over all the <rs>North</rs> to obliterate all traces of State in dependence, and to establish <num value="1">one</num> consolidated Government for the <rs>North</rs> during the remainder of the war. All this he has done in <num value="2">two</num> short years and let us see what more he proposes to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> We will assume that he can carry out his abolition and extermination programme, although no <num value="1">one</num> on the face of the earth but his own deluded subjects believes it practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>What will <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> have then accomplished for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Before his object can be accomplished the proprietors of the <rs>Southern</rs> soil must be annihilated, and with them the intelligence and skill which have guided Southern labor, and made the <rs>Southern</rs> soil the garden of the earth.--It was the productions of the <rs>South</rs> which mainly supported the <rs>Government</rs>, and which gave the <rs>North</rs> its preponderating wealth and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The gigantic efforts which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have made for the restoration of the <rs>South</rs> are the best evidence of the estimate which it puts upon the money value of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>That value, however, has been derived from the peculiar labor which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has determined to destroy, and without which, as all experience proves, it is impossible to cultivate Southern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The example of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> proves that the most fertile spot of the earth can be converted into a wilderness by precisely that process which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> proposes to apply to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>What, then, would be the value of the <rs>South</rs> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>What would become of the cotton, tobacco, and rice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>And without them, what would be the fate of Northern commerce and manufactures and revenues?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The more complete its victory over the <rs>South</rs>, the more thorough and remediless would be its own rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> alone, if she could raise a sufficient cotton supply in her possessions, would be the gainer, but the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would be hopelessly bankrupt, with all the sources of her wealth destroyed, and no possibility of future recuperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The South would fall like the strong man in the temple, dragging down the <name>Philistines</name> with him. But, happily, no such fate is in reserve for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The just <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who rules in the armies of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth, and who has hitherto baffled the devices of our enemies, will continue to aid us in our struggle for independence of the most corrupt and wicked despotism of modern, times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Whatever the event of the war, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have fallen forever and on every pillar of that grand <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> edifice, which once challenged the admiration of the world, is written. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> It the old notion that <q>&#x0022;figures cannot lie&#x0022;</q> has not been already exploded, it is likely to be so before the end of this war. <persName n="Chase,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> writes that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> debt is loss than <measure n="640000000dollars" type="currency">$640,000,000</measure>, including even the legacy of <measure n="70000000dollars" type="currency">$70,000,000</measure> left by the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> The old <orgName n="U. S.

Now, for <num value="1">one</num> year, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been paying for <num value="750000">750,000</num> men. So here are <measure n="750000000dollars" type="currency">$750,000,000</measure> for the army alone, at the old rates, for <num value="1">one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Previously that is from <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had <num value="150000">150,000</num> men in the field, which cost him, at the same rate, <measure n="95000000dollars" type="currency">$95,000,000</measure>. The whole sum is <measure n="845000000dollars" type="currency">$845,000,000</measure> for the <num value="750000">750,000</num> and for the <num value="150000">150,000</num>, the latter being takes in with the former after this time last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It must be recollected that <num value="2">two</num> separate enrollments were ordered, each of <num value="300000">300,000</num> men; that is, <num value="600000">600,000</num> in all. They have already cost an enormous sum, but we leave them out of the estimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We have, then, according to the moderate allowance we have made, <measure n="845000000dollars" type="currency">$845,000,000</measure> for he army alone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> But has the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government no expenses except army expenses!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Does the navy cost nothing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Does the civil service cost nothing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Does it cost nothing to carry on the <rs>Government</rs> in these perilous times?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It used to cost <num value="50000000">fifty</num> to <num value="70000000">seventy millions</num> in times of profound peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Assuredly not. All these cause combined must swell the debt to at least <measure n="1000000000dollars" type="currency">$1,000,000,000</measure> even if it be admitted that a soldier <unclear>poets</unclear> no more now than he did in the old army. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>There never existed an army, since the time of Zerxes, at <unclear></unclear> which was furnished so extravagantly.
