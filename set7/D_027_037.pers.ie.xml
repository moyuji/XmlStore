<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There was no news of importance from any quarter yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The war talk on the streets was chiefly directed to the discussion of the recent inexplicable surrender of <placeName reg="Fort Gaines, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,2335258">Fort Gaines</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The character of the officer who made the surrender was freely discussed and as freely denounced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The officer is <persName n="Anderson,Colonel,C.,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Anderson,C.,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He is a native of <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, where his family resides, and at the breaking out of the war was in the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>After the secession of the <name>States</name> took place, he came to <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and was appointed <rs type="role2">Major</rs> of an Alabama regiment, from which he was detached to act as Adjutant and <rs type="role" reg="Inspector General">Inspector- General</rs> on <persName n="Gladden,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Gladden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gladden</surname></persName>'s staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Shortly afterwards the <orgName type="regiment" key="21ALRegiment">Twenty-first Alabama regiment</orgName> was raised, the troops composing it being for the most part from the most respectable families in <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and a great many of them under the conscript age.

<head>Negro troops.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals are unanimous in denouncing the negro troops for their cowardice at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> for putting them in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Some of them qualify their denunciation of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> by accusing <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, in complaisance to whom, they say, the experiment was made; but they all agree that the duty upon which the negroes were ordered was such as demanded the service of the bravest and most thoroughly-tried regiments in the whole army, and that the most indifferent and least experienced were thrust upon it. So, it seems, this is all that the poor negro gets from his new masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>He is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pushed forward upon the most dangerous service that can possibly be required of a soldier &mdash; he takes the bullets and bayonets which his better disciplined white comrades should receive &mdash; he acts as a living rampart to shield them from danger &mdash; and when he is compelled, by a fire which no troops on earth could stand, to break and run, he gets nothing but curses and jeers in return for his devotion! --This is <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> all over, and is the attempt to prove that, had the place of the negroes been filled by white regiments, the event would have been different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>There is nothing in the history of &#x0022;The Army of the <rs>Potomac</rs>&#x0022; to prove the truth of this assertions or to show that the best of its white troops would not have been beaten quite as effectually as were the unfortunate negroes, whom they forced into their ranks in spite of their wishes and remonstrances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> This trial of the negro, however, seems to have effectually dispelled the last illusion with regard to the services expected from that race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Before the war commenced, the <name>Abolitionists</name>, totally mistaking the character of the negro, and the condition in which he existed, were constantly in the habit of representing him as an oppressed captive, ready to take vengeance upon his oppressors at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> signal of a liberating army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The most glowing pictures were drawn of midnight murders and conflagrations; of huge slaves brandishing axes and torches; of Southern women and children massacred upon their hearthstones, or fleeing to the woods for safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The negro was represented as the very incarnation of the fabled <rs>Nemesis</rs> &mdash;&mdash; the <rs>Avenger</rs> of the wrongs of whole generations &mdash; the <hi rend="italics">Fate</hi> of the unfortunate white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The progress of the war soon dissipated all these idle imagining. --Except in a very few instances, the negro manifested no hostility whatever to his master, for the simple reason that he had never been oppressed, as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> presumed he had been &mdash; presumed so because, if they had been in his master's place, they would have wrung the last possible exertion from his tortured limbs &mdash; and that he had nothing to avenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Thus they got rid of <num value="1">one</num> delusion, only to fall into another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The negro, from the very law of his origin in a tropical climate, is indolent, and will not work if he can avoid it. He is, moreover, ignorant, credulous, and peculiarly open to temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>A band of tolerably good music can allure <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them to any exodus that the performers may desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>They will follow it through field and forest, through bog and mire, to the end of the world. --Having become aware of this, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have employed this expedient with astonishing success.--A band in any neighborhood is sufficient to attract <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the negroes from all the plantations in <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Other temptations were added; and thus <num value="1000">thousands</num> have been tolled off from homes better and happier than they will ever see again; and this circumstance gave rise to the greatest delusion of all; namely, to the belief that the negroes could be made soldiers of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> The negro is patient, enduring, and by no means vindictive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>He is, naturally, a respecter of authority, and is the most acute person in the world in distinguishing the <hi rend="italics">real</hi> gentleman from the pretender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Neither fine clothes nor fine airs can impose upon him. He knows a gentleman by instinct, and he respects him though he be in rags, while he has no respect, for the vulgar pretender, though clad in purple and fine linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>But he cannot be made a soldier of, especially by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, for whom he has no respect and whom he cannot be induced to treat otherwise than as an equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>He knows that a white man ought not to put himself on a level with him, and he despises him for doing it. He will not respect his <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers, and therefore <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s hopes are blasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>He will hardly be able to conquer the <rs>South</rs> by means of the negro, and he has found it out. This is his last card.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>He has tried every other, and each has failed him in its turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>About a year before the war began, <persName n="Hickman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hickman</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, declared, in a speech, &#x0022;<num value="18000000">18,000,000</num> can beat <num value="8000000">8,000,000</num>.&#x0022; It has not turned out so. If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation had a proper sense of the attitude in which they stand, they would hang their heads in shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>They are <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times more numerous than we are. They had, at the beginning of the war, all the old army and old navy, while we had not a soldier or a ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>They have now <num value="600">six hundred</num> war vessels afloat, armed with the heaviest guns known to naval science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They had all the arsenals and all the manufactories that belonged to the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They had the seas free and the arsenals and manufactories of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> at their service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They had a population of <num value="25000000">25,000,000</num> from which to raise and recruit their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They had free access to <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, from which they have been drawing troops at the rate of nearly <num value="40000">40,000</num> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They had access to <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, whence they have imported quite as largely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>They have called into the field <num value="2800000">2,800,000</num> troops, and have actually put in <num value="1800000">1,800,000</num>, according to their own showing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They have run themselves in doubt to the tune of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>They are everlastingly boasting of their honor and their determination to wipe us out of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>And yet, with all these advantages, they have been compelled to call for help on the poor negro &mdash; to tear him from his home and force him into the ranks &mdash; to put him forward as a living rampart for their white troops &mdash; to teach him war cries which they know must add <num value="10">ten</num>-fold to his dangers &mdash; to see him slaughtered without mercy, and without daring to reinforce him. It is the most shameful, the most humiliating, picture ever presented by a nation to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>And yet the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> boast of it &mdash; absolutely glory in their own shame &mdash; so utterly destitute are they of all the feelings which ennoble man and tend to redeem what is least commendable in his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>They cease not to boast, though the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, everywhere successful, stands to give the lie to their vain-glory; for what a poor, pitiful, miserable set of poltroons, and liars, and braggarts, must compose that nation, when it is not able, with all its advantages, even backed by our own negroes, to reduce us to submission! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>They will be remembered, and the day will probably come when he will pay the penalty before he goes to that long account, in which his settlement must be thorough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It is not unlikely that his brutalities had already begun to fill his imagination with fears of retribution, and that this induced him to ask to be relieved from the command of the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">army of Western</orgName> <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; a request which was granted by his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>He certainly will be increasing his peril very much by coming to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> --We were informed early in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> that the demand for army supplies was so urgent that your Department felt constrained to disregard our schedule prices then in force, and offer market rates to the farmers for their wheat, if delivered in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>This policy was deemed indispensable to insure the <name>Early</name> receipt of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Concurring with the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> in the paramount importance of obtaining, at the earliest practicable period, an ample quantity of wheat for the support of the army, we apprehended, as so great a disparity existed between our former rates and the rates then offering in our leading cities, that unless we advanced prices our action might seriously embarrass the government in their efforts to obtain immediate supplies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/> Under these circumstances, and owing to the very short crop of wheat and unprecedented demand for breadstuffs, together with the depreciation in the currency, as well as to the further fact that the farmers were then securing the oat and hay crops, we proposed the advanced prices set forth in our <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> schedules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> But now, as the immediate wants of the army are being provided for, and vigorous efforts are initiated to reduce the currency and reinstate public credit, we are disposed to accept the recent manifestations of public opinion in regard to our prices as the strongest assurance that in future adequate supplies can be secured on very moderate terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/> As the press, the public, and the farmers in part, have all united in condemning our rates as too high, we therefore Defer to what seems to be the general desire and propose the following prices: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> Having re-adopted the <name>Schedules</name> for <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct> last, in accordance with the clearly- manifested wishes of the people, we have thought it advisable and proper to stimulate the sale and delivery of small grain &#x0026;c, now so much needed as to be indispensable, by advancing the price of wheat, flour, corn and <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>, oats and hay, delivered in the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> Therefore we place the price of wheat at <measure n="7.50dollars" type="currency">$7.50</measure> per bushel, and a corresponding advance of <num value="0.5">50 per cent</num> on all the grades of flour, mill-offal, &#x0026;c; and corn we assess at <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">$6</measure> per bushel, and <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs> at <measure n="6.30dollars" type="currency">$6.30</measure> per bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Oats and hay, per <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> unbaled, at <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">$6</measure>, and at <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">$7</measure> per <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>, baled east of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, and delivered during the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">Railroad iron</rs> not being included in the <rs>Government</rs> <sic>contradts</sic> with the iron manufactories, should not have been advanced in our last Schedules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>So we re-adopt our old valuation for <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, and put the price at <measure n="90dollars" type="currency">$90</measure> per ton. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/> The foregoing are to be the prices of wheat, flour, mill-offal, corn and <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>, oats, bay and <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, delivered during the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> In <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> we propose to adopt simply the former Schedules for <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>, with the exception of the assessment upon <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, which we wish to continue at <measure n="190dollars" type="currency">$190</measure> per ton during the month of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/> We also re-adopt the revision of our <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and March Schedule in reference to the impressment of horses, as published in our <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> Schedule. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> We trust that the people in those counties who have recently, in public meetings, expressed their views in favor of low prices will now, since all impediments have been removed, as patriotically lead out in tendering and selling, both to the <rs>Government</rs> and to the people, all they can spare, at Schedule rates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> Such an example voluntarily set before the people would exert a most salutary influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The public may be assured we will interpose no barrier to thwart either their benevolent intentions or generous contributions in behalf of their country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> in assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> We designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the government needed at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> horses at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value</hi> are impressed, We respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> the terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or price <hi rend="italics">for a number</hi> of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> in illustration of our views, We will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient, or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Any horses, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &#x0026;c. </p>

<head>Revision of the <name>Schedules</name> of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct> last.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/> Since the adoption of our schedules for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed <num value="33">thirty-three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to render any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Therefore, we assure the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery for wagon horses or mules, impressed since the passage of the currency bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly as each horses or mule presently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forth with call on all of these persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>But allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our average appraisement, <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">$400</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the inferior, as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issue of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for homes or mules impressed, should in all such cases themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>But if, after this re- valuation and settlement, any person should not be satisfied, the party could then appeal to our Board and have the case reconsidered. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Hubard,,E.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="default:Hubard,E.,W.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName>  <surname>Hubard</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gisbony,,Robert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="default:Gisbony,Robert,,,"><foreName n="Robert">Robt.</foreName> <surname>Gisbony</surname></persName>, <persName n="Harrison,,William,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00275" reg="default:Harrison,William,B.,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Harrison</surname></persName>,</signed> <lb/> <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioners</rs> of Appraisement for the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>. <lb/> By order (Signed) <signed><persName n="Cooper,,S.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00276" reg="default:Cooper,S.,,,"><foreName>S.</foreName>  <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>,</signed> Adjutant and <rs type="role" reg="Inspector General">Inspector-General</rs>. <lb/> Official: <signed><persName n="Clay,,H.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="default:Clay,H.,L.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName>  <surname>Clay</surname></persName>,</signed> <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Adjutant General">Assistant Adjutant-General</rs>. <lb/> All appeals and communications for the <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName> should be addressed to <persName n="Chilton,,D.,Sounders,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00278" reg="default:Chilton,D.,Sounders,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>Sounders</foreName> <surname>Chilton</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of the <rs>Board Richmond</rs>, Va. <term type="printrun">au 5--1w</term> </closer> </div4> </div3> </div2> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/>
