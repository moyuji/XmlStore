<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> We have come here for the purpose, as I take it, of throwing off a government to which we have been accustomed, and of seeking new safeguards for our security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is a most solemn act, and I trust, gentlemen, we have all come here to preserve the honor and character of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>If anything has been decided by the late election, it is that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> must be taken out of this Confederacy in as speedy a manner as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> I trust that nothing may interfere; no outside pressure, no guarantees from abroad, will drive us from our purpose; for, gentlemen, there are <num value="2">two</num> dangers which we are to avoid &mdash; overtures from abroad, and disputations from within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I trust that the door now is forever closed from any further connection with our Northern Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>What guarantees can they offer us more binding, more solemn, and with a higher sanction, than the present written compact between us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Has that sacred instrument protected us from the jealousy and aggressions of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, which commenced <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, and which ended in the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Has it protected us from the cupidity and avarice of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, who, for <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>, have imposed upon us the burden of sustaining this government, chiefly upon the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Has it saved us from Abolition petitions, intended to annoy and insult us on the very floors of Congress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Has it thrown any obstacle around us to the conversion of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> into a free-soil State, without any previous territorial existence, without any defined boundaries?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Did it throw any protection around the <rs>Southern</rs> settlers of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, when the soil of that Territory was invaded by emigrants, armed in a crusade against the <rs>South</rs> by the <rs>Northern</rs> people; when even their women contributed <persName n="Colt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Colt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colt</surname></persName>'s revolvers to put down the slaveholder?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Has not that instrument been trodden under their very feet by every Northern State by placing on their books statutes nullifying the laws for the recovery of fugitive slaves? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> I trust, gentlemen, we will put no faith in paper guarantees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They are worthless, unless written in the hearts of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>As there is no common bond between us, all attempts to continue us united, will only prove futile to the least and smaller section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Our greatest danger is from any division within our border. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> In inaugurating a great event like this, I trust we will go onward, and not be diverted from our purpose by any dictates from without, but do what we are sent to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>In the present emergency, the most decided measures are the safest and wisest.--To our sister States who are identified with us in interest and feeling, we will cordially and kindly look for co-operation and for a future Union; but it must be after we have asserted and resumed our original and inalienable rights and powers of sovereignty and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We can then form a government with them, having a common interest with people of homogeneous feeling, united together by all the ties that can bind States in <num value="1">one</num> common destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>From the position we may occupy towards the <rs>Northern States</rs>, as well as from our own internal structure of society, the government may, from necessity, become strongly military in its organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>When we look back upon the inheritance, the common glories and triumphant power of this wonderful Confederacy, no language can express the feelings of the human heart, as we turn from the contemplation, and sternly look to the great future that opens before us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> It is a curious fact that, in most of the abusive articles with which the <rs>London</rs> press has lately teemed against the <rs>South</rs>, the editors never fail to drag in the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> by the head and ears, and rain down a storm of kicks and cuffs upon that execrated race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>It is not enough that <name>English</name> tyranny has steeped <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName> to the lips in suffering and destitution, depriving its unhappy people of the roof that sheltered them and the very country in which they were born, but they must be followed in their exile by the taunts and curses of their oppressors, who, no longer able to crush and rend and devour them, stand off and gnash their teeth in impotent hate and malice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>There are several excellent reasons why we hear at this juncture such a furious rush upon the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> in every newspaper assault upon the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and obvious <num value="1">one</num> is that the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, whether living in the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>South</rs>, are to a man on the side of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and will always be found there, in peace or war. The spectacle of an <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> abolitionist is a phenomenon not often beheld in this part of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> have seen so much of real slavery in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> that when an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> affects to sympathize with the woes of &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">nagurs,</hi>&#x0022; <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Patrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Patrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Patrick</surname></persName>,</hi> who knows by his own sad experience the hypocrisy and heartlessness of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName>,</hi> only feels the most intense disgust and contempt.--Moreover, the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> have proved, by their industry and energy in this country, that they are not the indolent, worthless creatures it has been the fashion of the <rs>English</rs> to represent them; but that, if treated like men, and given an opportunity to secure the just rewards of labor, they will stand as high in the scale of humanity as their oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Their contributions to the labor of this country have given an irresistible impetus to all its great works of public improvement, and the immense sums sent to their relatives at home prove that, in generosity and nobleness of heart, no people in the world excel them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi> justly remarks that no settlement can be durable that does not provide the guarantees against disturbance which are afforded only by constitutional provisions, placed beyond the reach of mere majorities, influenced for the moment by popular commotion or excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>If the country is to have permanent exemption from the pernicious effects of slavery and anti-slavery agitation during our frequently recurring elections, the subject should be so comprehensively covered by amendments to the national organic law as will remove it from the control of party leaders, and, also, from the temptation to tinker at it in the construction of platforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>This being the case, and such fundamental legislation requiring the consideration of the people, the sooner Congress lays the subject before them, the sooner the troubles of the country will be at an end.
