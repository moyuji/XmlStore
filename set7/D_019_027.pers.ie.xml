<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/> It will be seen that their object is to induce the <orgName n="South Carolina Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of South Carolina</orgName> to send on Commissioners to meet Commissioners from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and also from all the <name>States</name> that think proper to send similar Commissioners, on the <date value="02-04"> 4th of February</date> next, in <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName> to &#x0022;consider, and, if practicable, to agree upon some suitable adjustment&#x0022; of the great issues that have been made in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/> We are disposed to treat with the most profound consideration every proposition that may emanate from the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, and to yield to her almost everything, except what may involve vital principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>More than a year ago the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, actually by a most sincere desire to do everything to her power to avert the dangers that it was manifest then threatened the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, <unclear></unclear> <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and made an urgent appeal to her to step forward and devise some plan upon which the <name>States</name> immediately concerned might act together, and save their peace and their rights, and yet preserve the common Constitution as a blessing for all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>It was then thought unnecessary, on the part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, to take any steps to act in concert with <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>If our <unclear></unclear> States had acted at that period, perhaps something might have been done to secure new guarantees by which our peace and our charted rights might have been protected in a common Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>As far as the <rs>Northern States</rs> are concerned, they have, many of men often violated their obligations as States under the <rs>Federal</rs> compact; and the compromises that have been made being the <num value="2">two</num> great sections of the <name>Con</name>- federacy have been wantonly set aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>We have appealed in vain to their plighted both and to the integrity of the covenant.--We have been traduced and denounced through their pulpits, their press, their orators, and their statesmen, as unworthy of equality both them as States, and even as their inferiors in a social point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>Their people have united in over whelming majorities at the recent elections, upon issues which openly involve our peace and existence, to put into power a party who entertain the deepest and most malignant hostility to our institutions and to our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>This is the great overt act of the people at the ballot-box, from which there no appeal to any higher tribunal, under our system of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>They have greed to place at the head of the army and navy a President, not for the protection of the rights and the peace of our people under a common inheritance, fixed and transmitted to express charters from the very origin of the government, but with open and avowed principles of deep and settled hostility, and with pledges made by him, at the head of a powerful party, for the final extermination of institutions essential to our power as a people and to the peace of our society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>We have been forced to resume our original powers of government and to assert our separate sovereignty as a State, in order to seek that protection which we were compelled to believe would not be given to us and to our people under the power of such a party and such a <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/> Under these circumstances, however much I might be disposed to yield the most profound respect to the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, and to any suggestion from her, yet it is difficult to perceive upon what grounds this State could agree to send Commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to meet Commissioners from the <rs>Northern States</rs> as well as from the <rs>Southern States</rs>.-- It might only result in deeper and wider difficulty and confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>I refer the whole matter with great deference, to your wisdom and decision, hoping in any event that the kindest and most respectful reply may be made to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/> Perhaps it is not improper to state that this State has agreed, through her Convention, to meet delegates from other seceding States, at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-02-4"><day reg="4">fourth</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, and our Convention has actually appointed delegator to attend this meeting from these States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>The object of this <orgName n="States Convention at Montogomery" type="convention">Convention of States at Montgomery</orgName>, will be to form immediately a common Government for the <name>States</name> that have seceded, and by efficient organization to secure their permanent independence beyond the reach of any contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>It would obviously be impolitic for this State to send delegates to a meeting at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, appointed for the same day, to meet the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs> with a view to preserve or to reconstruct the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> with them, when we have agreed <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to meet our sister seceding States, to whom we owe our deepest obligations, and feel bound by every tie to make no compromises with any other powers until we have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> formed with them a separate and <orgName n="Independent Union" type="union">independent Union</orgName>. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Pickens,,F.,W.,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00667" reg="default:Pickens,F.,W.,,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Pickens</surname></persName>.</hi> </p>
