<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The great expectations if a fight have gradually given way, until now but few entertain any hopes of <num value="1">one</num> or, at least, believe the advance of the enemy exceedingly problematical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Arguing upon general principles it is difficult to imagine how <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, occupying the position he does before the <rs>Northern</rs> people, can avoid living battle before the season closes I have seen, by the extracts from the <rs>Northern</rs> press that public opinion is strongly urging the army on, and it remains to be seen whether <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is strong enough to resist the tide that is bearing him towards <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> It was a saying of <num value="1">one</num> of the ancient philosophers, that if you drive Nature out of the house with a pitch-fork, she will come in again at the window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nature asserts it ruling presence even in the heroic <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of war. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> race commenced the campaign with magnificent schemes of conquest; it has degenerated, under the irresistible impulse of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nature, into the petty business of theft, pillage, and arson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Upon the cowardly calculation of <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, they commenced a war which they otherwise would not have dared to undertake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They thought by the more force of numbers, and without any necessity of hard fighting, to overrun and trample us down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Even in their boastings of these grand intentions, they could not suppress the ruling instincts of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nature.--Their talk was of property seized, farms confiscated, and wealth and treasure appropriated to the avaricious victors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>In the easy conquest which a power of <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num> was to give them over the <rs>South</rs>, their talk was of robbery on the grand scale, and of appropriating other men's goods by the <num value="1000000">million</num>'s worth. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> Their grand naval expedition is to become the instrument of an extensive scheme of piracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It is not to attack our cities or to land its forces and to make head against our troops where they are ready to make fight; but small islands, exposed border plantations, unprotected hen- roosts and pig sties, household and <rs n="kitchen furniture" type="product">kitchen furniture</rs> left under the guard of women, and negro non-combatant peasants laboring in the fields, are the subjects upon which they are to exert their prowess and their valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Friday there was a heavy rain and I believe now it is allowed that it would be almost impracticable to move artillery of provision trains.
