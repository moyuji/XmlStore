<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> After a gallant defence of <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, Duppel was taken yesterday morning by assault, and the <rs>Danish</rs> army has lost its last hold on the mainland of Schleswig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>For some days the event has been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Towards the close of last month it became evident that the <name>Prussians</name> had thrown off the <name>Lugar</name> which marked the entry conduct of the siege, and were resolved to press it with vigor, and to force, if possible, a surrender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> It need hardly be said that the prospect of the coming conference had much to do with this sudden display of energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Day by day they brought their the bearer the <placeName key="tgn,1000066" n="1.000 10" reg="Danmark,Europe">Danish</placeName> batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>At the beginning of last week it became evident that the <name>Dance</name>, unless largely reinforced, could not long hold the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Unless such an army could have been placed in Schleswig as would have compelled the enemy to raise the siege, the fate of Duppel was scaled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> At last the assault was made yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>We do not yet know the details, but we trust that the conflict was less bloody than others which our time has witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It seems certain that the <name>Dance</name> themselves expected the result, for they are described as dismantling the forts of most of their guns over to Alsen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>However that may be, we must presume that they defended the place with sufficient obstinacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>But the <name>Prussians</name> were successful. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>These appear to have been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mastered by the <name>Prussians</name>, who then passed to the <rs>Danish</rs> rear and took possession of their communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Then redoubts <num value="8">eight</num>, <num value="9">nine</num> and <num value="10">ten</num>, on the <rs>Danish</rs> right, were taken, together with the <hi rend="italics">tele de pont.</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> The bridge was destroyed, and <num value="2000">two thousand</num> men, with <num value="51">fifty one</num> officers, are spoken of as having fallen into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Thus ends the siege of Duppel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Like the <name>Russians</name> on the morrow of the great assault of the <name>Malakoff</name>, the <rs n="Dane" type="group">Danes</rs> have abandoned their positions and retreated across a narrow piece of Water, with the intention, no doubt, to dispute the further progress of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>They probably do not consider themselves as wholly beaten, or their cause as lost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> On the other hand, the <name>Prussians</name> have won a decisive victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It may not be a great <num value="1">one</num>, it may furnish no fitting subject for boasting, nor of complacent remembrance hereafter: but still it is a victory, and <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> may congratulate herself and her <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> friends that the <rs>Danish</rs> force is now entirely driven from continental Schleswig. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> <num value="2">Two</num> allied powers have accomplished that for which they profess to have taken up arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>They have their &#x0022;material guarantee.&#x0022; They have entered Schleswig; they have defeated the <rs>King</rs>'s army, driven it from <num value="2">two</num> fortified positions, killed, wounded, or captured several <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <rs n="Dane" type="group">Danes</rs>, superceded the royal authority, displaced the <rs>King</rs>'s coinage, ejected his officials; forbidden the use of his name even in the prayers of the church; and thus, they may hope, satisfied the most patriotic aspirations of the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> At present the <rs n="Dane" type="group">Danes</rs> are concentrated in Alsen, where they will endeavor to make a stand at the works which they are said to have been long preparing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Should the war continue, there can certainly be no doubt as to the fate of their army.--the allied forces will be sooner or later able to cross the sound, and compel a retreat to the <rs>Danish</rs> ships or a capitulation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> The feminine gender has always been a proverb of curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We do not understand how the sex got that character originally, but it is generally conceded that a woman is a living and breathing interrogation point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The men, and especially all <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> men, are, to our mind, as prying, as inquisitive, and as loquacious as women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Nearly every man, not provided with firearms, now carries a revolving weapon in his mouth which can fire off at least <num value="6">six</num> questions without reloading, if, indeed, any charge at all is necessary in the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It takes very little ammunition indeed to fire off this kind of <num value="6">six</num> shooters, a certain amount of explosive gas being all that is necessary. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Still they could be endured, like other human afflictions, if they would gratify their love of inquiry solely among their own countrymen; but when these inveterate gossips thrust themselves upon <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners, as has been done a good many times during this war, and proceed to pump them upon topics of public interest, they become an intolerable nuisance, richly deserving all the pains and penalties of the old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> law against gossips. </p>
