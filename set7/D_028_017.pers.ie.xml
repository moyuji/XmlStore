<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The reader will discover, by reference to the terms of this paper, that the rates of subscription and advertising have been advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>These increased charges are forced upon us, and the press generally, by the extraordinary price of everything which goes to make up a newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In no other way can a journal live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>To attempt to adhere to former rates in the face of the fabulously high charges to which the business of newspaper publishing is subjected, would be fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>A necessity so palpable to all needs no further excuse or palliation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> We have, since the war, encountered difficulties and embarrassments of so serious a character as to make the business of journalism exceedingly disagreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We have endeavored to overcome them in the best manner, and have lately succeeded in presenting the reader with a sheet enlarged and greatly improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Should no untoward and unexpected event occur, we shall continue to print this enlarged sheet, in its legible typography, until the war is ended. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> At the annual meeting of the <orgName n="Virginia Baptist General Association" type="association">Baptist General Association of Virginia</orgName>, in <date value="1864-06">June, 1864,</date> the following persons were appointed a committee to provide for the education of the children of deceased and disabled soldiers, namely: <persName n="Bass,,Colin,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Bass,Colin,,,"><foreName>Colin</foreName> <surname>Bass</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>; <persName n="Goddin,,Wellington,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Goddin,Wellington,,,"><foreName>Wellington</foreName> <surname>Goddin</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>; <persName n="Dickinson,Reverend,A.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Dickinson,A.,E.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Montague,the Honorable,R.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Montague,R.,L.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Montague</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jeter,Doctor of Divinity,J.,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Jeter,J.,B.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Jeter</surname>, <roleName n="Doctor of Divinity">D.

D.</roleName></persName> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The committee have matured a plan of operations which, it is hoped, will greatly further the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They propose, not to originate schools, but to patronize such as now exist, or may hereafter be brought into existence; to limit their efforts, except in special cases, to aid in giving a good <name>English</name> education; and, in making their appropriations, to be controlled by <hi rend="italics">neither sectarian, sectional nor social distinctions.</hi> It has been determined also to assist soldiers, disabled in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, who may desire to resume the studies that were laid aside at the call of patriotism for &#x0022;the might slumbering in their arms.&#x0022; Several young men, now that they can no longer remain in the army, owing to wounds or impaired health, have applied to us for appropriations, by means of which they may prepare themselves for some position of usefulness.--This class will find the committee ever ready to extend to them prompt and cheerful aid, and are invited to make their wants known to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> In order the better to cultivate this great field, <hi rend="italics">sub-committees</hi> have been appointed at prominent points to look out and place in schools those whom we propose to benefit, and to aid in disbursing the funds entrusted to the committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Thus we hope to extend our operations to every county and every neighborhood in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> It is stated, on what seems to be good authority, that there are from <num value="5000">five</num> to <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> children in the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> whose fathers have been killed, have died or been disabled in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Every day that the struggle is protracted, the number, already so startling, will be increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A large proportion of these little ones are in indigent circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The means that had been accumulated by the toil and economy of their parents <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> have been consumed during these long, sad years of war. While their property has been wasting away, the cost of education, like everything else, has been augmenting, until now comparatively few of the poorer classes can afford the expenses of an ordinary country school.--How then can the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of boys and girls, whose fathers fill shallow graves on our battle fields or around our hospitals, secure even the elements of an English education?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Who is to pay the tuition and buy the books and stationery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is obviously the duty of those whose homes, and persons, and property have been protected by our vigilant armies to do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It must be done in this way, and it must be done right early.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Some of these children were old enough to enter school <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> ago, when their fathers went into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Soon they will have passed the period in which they may be influenced for good. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We must not, we dare not, longer delay in a matter which, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the war, ought to have been engaging our most earnest attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The armies in the field occupy so largely our thoughts that we are in danger of forgetting the still greater armies which are <hi rend="italics">growing up around our firesides,</hi> into whose keeping we must commit that for which all this sacrifice of blood and treasure is being made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>What can we hope for if the youth of the land are left to the debasing influence of ignorance and vice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In vain will the fathers have shed their blood and conquered an honorable peace if the children are not prepared to preserve the dearly-bought inheritance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is by the proper education of the head and the heart that moral safeguards may be secured, and virtuous sentiment implanted and developed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> When we entered upon this war, and our men were volunteering all over the country, those of us who remained at home promised the soldier to make it <hi rend="italics">our</hi> care that his family should not suffer; that his children should fare as well as our own. Many a brave man, as he bade adieu to his loved ones, and brushed away the hot tears, lifted up his heart in gratitude to Heaven that such a pledge had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>And the belief that the people at home would faithfully keep this pledge has cheered him in all the toil and danger of the service, and made him the more willing to offer up his life on the altar of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He has nobly, gloriously, performed his part of the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But have we come up to the full measure of our duty to those who were dearer to that soldier than life itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is true, it may be that his family have not suffered for the necessaries of life; but what of the mind, to the cultivation of which scarcely a passing thought has been given?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Long, weary years have rolled away, but those little ones have not been taught to write their names nor to read <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> holy book. --Large sums have been spent on the education of other children; and had this soldier managed to stay at home, as probably he might have done but for the fires of patriotism that were burning in his soul, his children, too, would now be sharing with others the advantages of the best schools. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> It is a great mistake to suppose that our soldiers, who have families, attach but little importance to this subject.--With many it is the sorest, saddest trial of the war. The fear that his children will be uncared for makes many a soldier dissatisfied, and has caused some to turn their faces homeward against orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>A man of great gallantry, after <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of hard service in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, was stricken down in a late battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Just before his death he remarked to a clergyman that he was not afraid to die &mdash; death had no terrors for him &mdash; but that he did desire to live, that he might educate his children, who, without his care, must grow up in ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He was assured that ample provision would be made for them in this regard. &#x0022;Then,&#x0022; said he, <q>&#x0022;I have nothing more to desire,&#x0022;</q> and passed away to the spirit land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> It is a significant fact that a large proportion of the letters we receive, containing contributions to this cause, are written &#x0022;in the trenches,&#x0022; and send us a portion of the pittance which the soldier receives from Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> In view of these facts and considerations, we call upon our fellow-citizens, everywhere, to respond with a noble liberality to the claims of this cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars must be contributed if the work is prosecuted with that earnestness which it deserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Let every citizen, to the utmost limit of his ability, extend a helping hand to those whose fathers have fallen in defence of our holiest and dearest rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> You can render us most important service by inquiring after the children of our deceased and disabled soldiers, encouraging them to attend school, and reporting their names to us. If every <num value="1">one</num> to whom this circular is sent will thus exert himself, we shall soon have every neighborhood canvassed and all the objects of our solicitude cared for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> We beg to repeat the assurance that this movement is not the offspring of sectarianism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Our sub-committees embrace gentlemen of the several religious denominations, and some who make no profession of religion; all the schools in the country, without respect to the denominational proclivities of the teachers, are patronized; and every child, without reference to the religious tenet of its <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> parents, shares the benefit of our operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>This being so, we appeal to every patriot and philanthropist in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>We need hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars, with which to carry into effect this mighty undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In <num value="1">one</num> county alone we have already entered over <num value="100">one hundred</num> children at school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Scores of applications are coming up from almost every section of our beloved State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>In what way can you better promote the permanent well-being of our young Confederacy, and at the same time discharge a debt of gratitude to the brave men who have scarified all for their country's independence and honor? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> Besides defraying the expenses of the hundreds whom we are now educating, we wish to collect a sum sufficient to perform the same needful office for the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of little ones at present within the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>As soon as peace is restored, and these overrun sections of our State are once more open to us, there will be numbers whose only possible chance for securing an education must rest on such a system as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The resources of these desolated regions are so exhausted that assistance will be necessary to almost the entire population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>To meet the large expenditure which will then be required, we ought now to lay aside half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Whatever may be thought as to the ultimate redemption of the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency, it can hardly be doubted that our Government will make good every dollar which may be consecrated to this noble work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It will never repudiate a bond which has been donated to a service so sacred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> I leave this appeal with you &mdash; confidently expecting that you will render us every assistance in your power, and that by means of your co-operation scores of these dear little ones will be rescued from ignorance and vice, and be rendered worthy of the noble men whose names they bear &mdash; men who have lost limb or life that freedom might be saved. </p> 
<p>
