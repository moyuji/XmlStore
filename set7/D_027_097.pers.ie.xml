<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Quiet reigned on the lines below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The day was both foggy and cloudy, and from our works nearest the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines scarcely anything could be seen of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> but their pickets and their camp-fires &mdash; the latter indicating their line from <placeName reg="Deep Bottom, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2280567">Deep Bottom</placeName> northwest to the <placeName key="tgn,2275605" n="1.000 10" reg="Darbytown, Wayne, Pennsylvania">Darbytown</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>For several days the enemy have shown some restlessness in front of the extreme left of our line, which runs northeast from the <rs>Darbytown</rs> towards the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road, crossing the latter about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> from the southeastern suburbs of the city; and on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> there was a great rumbling of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> wagons and artillery, and a galloping to and fro of their cavalry, in this quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They are either preparing for another &#x0022;reconnaissance&#x0022; or they apprehend an attack from us. It is certain they have massed several divisions along the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There was a report, about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> morning, that they had attacked us at this point, and that a battle was going on; but the story was without foundation &mdash; the heavy firing of our batteries at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap no doubt gave rise to it; the closeness of the atmosphere rendering every sound of the cannon distinctly audible in the city. </p>
