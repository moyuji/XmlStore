<head>Lying reduced to a system.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> The letter which we published yesterday, from <persName n="Vanpolt,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="default:Vanpolt,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Vanpolt</surname></persName> to his uncle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/><persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most curious documents which this war has brought to light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>It confirms what we have often stated, and what has been very generally believed even before this authentic avowal, that lying has been reduced to a regular system by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, and is recognized by them as among the most effective instruments of warfare.-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> The Northern papers dare not print anything more than <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> allows them, and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> does not allow them to print the truth, unless in cases where it may aid the cause of deception, and accomplish all that a direct lie could effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> It may be said that there is little value in this discovery, since we knew beforehand that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> systematically lied in all their narratives where the truth would be disadvantageous to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>So far as the credulity of the <rs>Southern</rs> people may be affected, this is true enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>But there is another consideration and that a most important <num value="1">one</num>.--The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have the ear of the world outside of <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>, and we can very seldom reach it. They have told the most incredible lies about this war, and they have been believed in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, until the stern testimony of facts came slowly before the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, for instance, is still under the impression that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> gained a great victory at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, merely because he says so, and because it has never heard the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>When it shall have learned that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> remains now where he was <num value="1">one</num> month ago, and that the asserted victory has not advanced the cause he upholds in the slightest degree, it will learn also to estimate the value and extent of his success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>But in all future statements of his we fancy the press of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will be slow to place the confidence it placed in this <num value="1">one</num>, for the simple reason that the <rs>Government</rs> he serves, it is now undeniably shown, acts upon the advice of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, and deliberately lies when it speaks of its successes or its defeats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> We trust that our Government never may be induced to adopt this most dishonorable and most dangerous line of policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Hitherto it has been remarkable for coming even within the line of the strict truth, claiming too little rather than too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Although this gentler policy may sometimes lead to disappointment on the part of the multitude, it is far preferable to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>To lie about military affairs is to raise high expectations and great exultation, which, when the truth comes out, as it is sure to do, is always followed by a re-action prejudicial to the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Instances of that sort are numerous in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>We have more than once alluded to a very striking <num value="1">one</num> in the history of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, where the <rs>Consul Sempronius</rs>, after having had his army destroyed by <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> in the battle of the <name>Treble</name>, sent a false statement to the <name>Senate</name>, who published it to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>While they were in a state of perfect security, believing that their army had merely fallen back, the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> people were roused to a pitch of phrensy, succeeded by the deepest despair, on learning the true state of the case from the stragglers who had escaped death or captivity, and came pouring into the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>So fearful was the reaction that the <name>Senate</name> resolved never, if possible, to risk it again; and, when the still more fatal battle of Thrazymene occurred the <rs>Consul</rs> assembled the people and told them the whole truth, terrible as it was. And they were right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The people have a right to know the worst upon such occasions, and there can be no excuse for not telling it to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was charged by his enemies with not telling the truth to his people.--To <q>&#x0022;lie like a bulletin, &#x0022;</q> became a proverb throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>In our admiration of his transcend ant gamins, we had always believed that the charge was false; but since the publication of his letters to his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName></persName>, we are compelled to admit that there was much truth in it. He falsified military details upon principle as <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> advises to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Yet, what advantage did he derive from it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>He could not deceive his enemies, who soon learned to believe nothing he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>He deceived even his own people only for a time, for they understood the truth after it had been repeated a certain number of times, and were not taken in by it. Surely, if there ever lived a man who could afford to have the strict truth told with regard to his leads, he was that man. It is difficult to understand what he hoped to gain; but we can see that he must have gained very little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/><placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipsic</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7006197" n="1.000 46" reg="isola d' elba">Elba</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/><placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>, St. Helena came, in spite of it all and they could but have come had he always adhered to the truth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> When it is necessary to speak at all, it is always best to speak the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>What have the monstrous fabrications of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> done, but rendered the world incredulous to any story he may wish to palm upon its credulity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>It could not prevent him from being disgracefully routed around this city and driven under shelter of his gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>His last lie will most assuredly recoil upon himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It may not be prudent always to speak the truth; but in such cases it is best to say nothing. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
