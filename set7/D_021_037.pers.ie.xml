<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We can <unclear></unclear> believe that they would do it themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They neither understand its <unclear></unclear> nor the management of negroes, and even if they could get possession of every <unclear></unclear> plantation, the cotton crop of the <unclear></unclear> would never be what it has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <unclear></unclear> can live without cotton; it can raise <unclear></unclear> and corn, and, as a subjugated province, <unclear></unclear> will be the extent of its cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were not stark, staring mad, <unclear>they</unclear> would see that their anticipated conquest <unclear></unclear> South would be the most ruinous commercial defeat to themselves that any nation <unclear></unclear> suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> The only collection to the <rs>Governor</rs>'s proposition is, that is has the appearance of a sensation measure, and seems to imply that a greater necessity exists for the step he proposes now than has existed for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The committee cannot more effectively perform the service assigned them than by presenting an unvarnished statement of facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>In the month of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> last, the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> was suddenly invaded by the <rs>Federal</rs> army, and the inhabitants of its lower extremity, including the town of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>, and numbering between <num value="2">2</num> and <num value="3000">3,000</num> white persons, were compelled to make a hasty retreat, abandoning their homes, and almost their entire property, to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Their growing crops were destroyed, their provisions and stock were seized by the invaders, their slaves were seduced or forced within the lines of the enemy, everything valuable was stolen from their houses, and, to crown their misfortunes, the town of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName> was, in mid-summer, burnt to the ground, by order of the officers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, as a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The county of <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth City</placeName> has been reduced to desolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>These refugees are scattered throughout the lower counties of the <rs>State</rs>, and many of them are known to be in extreme destitution and want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Families that lived in comfort and affluence now earn a precarious subsistence by their toil, or have their wants supplied by the hand of friendship or of charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>To increase the destitution of the women and children, almost every man of the county capable of bearing arms is in the military service.
