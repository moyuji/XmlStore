<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> --The only good fighting men which the <rs>North</rs> can bring into the field, of the native race, are the hardy and adventurous men of the <rs>Northwestern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is only the soldiers drawn from this quarter, and those recruited from the foreign races, that have done any good fighting on their side in this war, or that give any promise of persisting in the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The best regiments under the command of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> on the <rs>Potomac</rs> are those which he drew from the <rs>Northwest</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> But the <rs>Northwestern</rs> people are infinitely more solicitous for the opening of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to free navigation and for subduing the <name>States</name> lying towards its mouth under the same political jurisdiction with themselves, than they are to secure the valueless city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, or the inconsiderable <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName> to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Already have the notes of complaint been sounded in the <rs>Northwest</rs> against the withdrawal of their regiments into the unprofitable field of action on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, to the neglect of the vital interests of the <rs>Northwest</rs> which concentrate upon the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This proposition may be assumed as true for the rest of the struggle; that the <rs>Northwest</rs> are hereafter to provide the great body of troops for the <rs>Northern</rs> armies, and that the <rs>Middle</rs> and Eastern States will be expected to contribute, as their quota of aid, the arms, munitions, clothing, and supplies of all kinds required for the war. As a general rule, good artisans are great cowards, as the regiments of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and New York have abundantly demonstrated in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is the rural districts only that furnish brave volunteers; and it is only in the granary of the great <rs>West</rs> that the <rs>North</rs> can recruit any troops worth bringing into the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It is a mistake to suppose that the <rs>Northwest</rs> are disaffected to this <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> war. They are even more fierce and determined than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> of the <rs>East</rs>, whose zeal in every.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>thing is measured by the rule, <hi rend="italics">what does it pay?</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> himself is a true index of Northwestern feeling in this regard, and certainly have the people of the <rs>Northwest</rs> more to lose by the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs> than any other portion of the <rs>Northern</rs> population If they are cut off from the navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, they are in a manner cut off from the world and hemmed in on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They have <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> on the <rs>North</rs>; the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on the <rs>East</rs>, who prey upon their industry; and the hostile <rs>South</rs> below them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They have no access to market except over foreign territory, or over railroads owned by corporations that have no souls, composed of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who have no honesty or conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The Northwest are in a predicament that compels them to fight; and it would be the most imbecile folly and blindness for the <rs>South</rs> to expect anything else but a formidable struggle with that young and giant community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> In this point of view the condition of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> presents a topic of absorbing and vital interest to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The South can never consent that any portion of territory lying South of the <rs>Ohio</rs> or <rs>Missouri</rs> rivers shall belong to an enemy.--If possible, the question of boundary rises superior to a question of State Sovereignty; inasmuch as the self-preservation of <num value="11">eleven</num> sovereign States is of superior importance to the mere political integrity of <num value="2">two</num> divided and distracted communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The time has undoubtedly arrived when the <rs>South</rs> must assume the power to treat <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Missouri</placeName> as a part of her own territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It had been better, and more consistent with the law-abiding spirit and policy of the <rs>South</rs>, to await the formal secession of those States, and their formal accession to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>; but their revolutionary condition now precludes these legal measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The voice of the people has no organ of expression; and, even if it had, the exigencies of the times would not permit the slow and formal processes usual to legal procedure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> can no longer be respected as forbidden ground to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They are both essential parts of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They must be ours, or we must in future continually consent to the presence of an enemy in the heart of our territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>To wait now for the formal secession of those States from the <rs>North</rs>, is to wait for an impossible event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It may, perchance, be true that a majority of voters in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> are for Union as against secession; even that case does not change the necessity which would impel the <rs>South</rs> to seize the <rs>State</rs> and fix her boundary upon the <rs>Ohio</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> But a large majority, both of Southern Missourian and of <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckian</rs> are with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The distractions of the times prevent the formal demonstration of this fact; and the <rs>South</rs> is bound to assume it. To wait for formal political action in revolutionary times, is to lose the kernel by sticking in the bark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> can only secede by revolutionary act; and the <rs>South</rs> may save the necessity of that by action of her own in strict conformity with her belligerent rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The <rs>North</rs> are not stopping to enquire of the constitutionality of this or that of their measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Their whole conduct and policy is usurpation; and it follows that many of their measures can only be met and counteracted by retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The South have acted upon retaliatory principles repeatedly in the progress of this controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Her march into the <placeName reg="Kentucky, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007255">territory of Kentucky</placeName> was justified upon these principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>And where can a case be found more urgent for continuing this policy than in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, where the enemy are preparing the most formidable of all their measures against us.? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> We sincerely trust that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> will dismiss all qualms and scruples about the legality of inaugurating a vigorous and decided policy in the quarter in which the <rs>North</rs> is concentrating forces so great and preparing operations against us so formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A foolish qualm and hesitation may in <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> turn over <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <rs>Kentucky</rs> fighting men into the regiments of the enemy, who might otherwise be enlisted under the flag of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> </div3>

<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>[from the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York Herald</orgName>, <date value="1861-04-03">April 3, 1861.</date>]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> A view extending some <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>, having <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> as a focus of observation, presents much that is gratifying and much that is to be regretted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Before the free labor of the <rs>North</rs> should boast of its advantages over the slave labor of the <rs>South</rs>, on principles of humanity and philanthropy, it should carefully consider the pauperism and crime existing among us. There are about <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of people inhabiting an area extending <placeName><distance reg="50miles">fifty miles</distance> from New</placeName> York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The Metropolitan district contains about <num value="1300000">1,300,000</num> people, who possess an aggregate wealth in real and personal estate of about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The assessors valued this property for <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct> at little over <num value="750000000">750,000,000</num> and the census marshals added to this about <num value="0.25">25 per cent.</num> as the true or cash value, thus making about <measure n="1000000000dollars" type="currency">$1,000,000,000</measure>. This amount divided among <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num> people, gives to each man, woman, and child about <measure n="833dollars" type="currency">$833</measure>, or to each person <measure n="21years" type="date">twenty-one years</measure> of age about <measure n="1600dollars" type="currency">$1,600</measure>, or to each head of a family about <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure>. Here we find an aggregate and an individual wealth now here else to be found on the continent of <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> in a territory embracing the same area. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> But a glance at the pauperism and crime existing in the same area will astound us. --Census marshals return <num value="144936">144,936</num> paupers in the <name>Metropolitan</name> district, wholly or partially supported at the public expense during the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Thus we see that about <num value="1">one</num> in every <num value="10">ten</num> of our population were either wholly or in part supported at the public expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This is independent of a large number supported by private charity, for which our citizens are proverbial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The number of criminals convicted within the year in the <name>Metropolitan</name> district was <num value="50958">50,958</num>, thus showing that crime is a natural attendant upon poverty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> This magnitude of pauperism and crime should be looked squarely in the face, as a thing we do not find to any great extent in the slave labor States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Though freedom is the normal condition of the white man he drags at every step the galling chains of interiority in social life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Here, among <num value="1000000">one million</num> <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> people, <num value="1">one</num> person in every <num value="10">ten</num> is wholly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>or in part, aided by public charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Would it not be better to reflect seriously on this condition of social life before we make war on the institution under which the physical comforts of the laboring classes are well provided for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The fact that within the last quarter of a century the slave population has about doubled &mdash; increase from <num value="2000000">two</num> to <num value="4000000">four millions</num>--shows that in physical comforts and general good treatment they have little to complain of. That they are happier than the free blacks, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, no <num value="1">one</num> can truthfully deny that they are better cared for in sickness, have more of the necessaries of life, than the great body of the laboring white class in the free States, is equally evident. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> When the above was written, New York had not begun to feel the privations of war. The state of things this winter will be <num value="10">ten</num> times worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>But it is not alone with reference to the war that we would commend it to attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It may serve to correct the universal delusion &mdash; a delusion which has prevailed even among ourselves &mdash; that great aggregations of wealth and population, such as are presented in the city life of the free States, are reliable indications of the general happiness and prosperity, and, as such to be desired in our own country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> Our own people, who have visited the <rs>North</rs> in days gone by, have been greatly impressed with the outside splendor of everything they saw. They never saw the inside life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They did not know that <num value="1">one</num> in every <num value="10">ten</num> of that population was supported at the public expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They stood upon the steps of the <rs type="place">Astor House</rs> and St. Nicholas and saw crowds of well-dressed people passing from morning till night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Suppose they could also have seen a procession pass by, composed of all the paupers of New York &mdash; an army numbering <num value="144936">one hundred and forty-four thousand nine hundred and thirty-six</num> men, women, and children &mdash; ragged, famished, hollow-jawed, wretched beggars!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Or, to enlighten still farther the intelligence of our Southern visitor, suppose, after he had regaled himself at the fashionable places of amusement, and looked in upon the colleges and common schools, and had prepared himself to hold forth on his return to the <rs>South</rs> about the superior provision made in the <rs>North</rs> for the education and moral advancement of the masses; suppose that he could have been entertained with a torch-light procession of the criminals of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>--an army of <num value="50968">fifty thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight</num> thieves, burglars, ruffians, rioters, incendiaries, and murderers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>what would he have thought of that glance at the inner life of a great city? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> And then he would not have seen half, no, not a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Of the paupers, the multitude that is avowedly pauper is but a small portion, and that the happiest portion, of the poor of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>There are vast numbers whose incessant labor obtains barely enough to keep soul and body together; who know not how soon they may be deprived even of that means of support, poor as it is; who struggle to keep up a decent appearance, and to make some provision for the future of families who are dearer to them than themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>What anxieties gnaw their hearts; what fears and apprehensions, wearing deep lines in their faces, careworn furrows which even the hand of death cannot always smooth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The few monopolize vast fortunes &mdash; the many condemned to precarious subsistence or absolute want &mdash; is the unvarying condition of city life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>So, too, in regard to the nominal criminals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The <num value="59000">fifty-nine thousand</num> acknowledged criminals of New York are but a small proportion of the actual criminals of that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The millionaires who have acquired their fortunes by swindling and dishonesty are as detestable thieves as any pickpockets whose faces figure in the <rs type="place">Rogues' Gallery</rs>, and some of them inferior to pick pockets in intelligence and good manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Many of the rich men of New York have cheated and robbed their way from the sewers to the <address><street n="5 Avenue">Fifth Avenue</street></address> as undeniably as others have cheated and robbed their way to the <name>Penitentiary</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> By what base arts has <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> himself crept into fortune!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>There is not a rogue in <placeName key="tgn,2071503" n="1.000 7" reg="ossining, westchester, new york">Sing Sing</placeName> with a heart more corrupt, and a face that better fits the inside of prison bars, than the proprietor of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> Nor, among the crimes of which the law takes no cognizance, and which, in that region, go unwhipped of justice, who shall calculate the number of seductions, the murder of female innocence, and the vice and misery that follow in its train?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>And yet, it is this kind of life which a certain class of philosophers has always held up to the <rs>South</rs> as the acme of human happiness and prosperity, and the garish outside of which has made superficial observers of the <rs>South</rs> discontented with a state of society in which pauperism is unknown, criminals few, female virtue respected, and the physical and moral welfare of the people, as a whole, better than that of any equal number of people on any other part of the earth's surface. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> If we desire to preserve unimpaired our pure Southern civilization, and the dignity and integrity of Southern character, we should not indulge in idle repining that the <rs>South</rs> has no large cities, and is mainly an agricultural people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>We hope to see no <num value="1">one</num> city absorbing the commerce and trade of the new Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>We want no New York, or <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Paris, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040685">Paris</placeName> to give political, moral, or social tone to a people now pure, just, brave, proud, and honorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Commerce and manufactures we may and ought to have, but our chief dependence must be that wonderful soil which produces such a vast diversity of the richest products of the earth, and which rewards with health, plenty, and happiness those who make it their reliance. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> As the public press is the guardian of the rights of a free people, it is incumbent upon it at all times to exercise a strict watch over the public good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>It may not, therefore, be amiss to call the attention of those in authority in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> to acts of plunder and robbery committed every day at <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, under the very eyes of those who should take care of the interests of the soldiers and of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>It is admitted that in putting the machinery of a new Government into immediate operation there must necessarily be much confusion and irregularity in the branches of the various departments; but it cannot with any degree of allowance be granted that a point of operations as prominent as that of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> should continue so long in a state of anarchy and disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The soldier, who leaves his home, his family, and all that he holds near and dear upon earth, forsaking the ease and comforts of home, sacrificing his private interests, and going forth to expose his life in defence of his country, certainly deserves all the protection that the arms of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> can throw around him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> The infamous offenders of justice that continually prowl around the express trains and express office at the <rs type="place">Junction</rs>, in the very blaze of broad day, and the hundreds of thieves that lurk under the covert of the night, committing depredations upon the property of the soldiers, ought to be brought to justice, and those whose business it is to attend to the transportation, delivery, and protection of such property, should be held responsible for the acts of injustice continually committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>If now and then a box of dainties which the loved ones at home send to their friends in the army, as an acceptable token of their esteem, and as a change from the coarse fare of the camp, was all that could be lost, it could be borne; but when the poor soldier receiving the pitiful sum of a private's pay, and a small bounty of <measure n="3.5dollars" type="currency">three and a half dollars</measure> per month from which to clothe himself, finds, after spending all his means and drawing from his resources at home to protect him from the piercing winds and cold frosts of winter, that his blankets and his new thick clothing which he had so carefully ordered to suit his peculiar necessities, just upon reaching the point of destination are taken away, almost from his own grasp, it is enough to excite in his breast the deepest indignation towards those who do not care for his wants, or protect him in procuring the necessities of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It is to be hoped that the authorities will speedily take some active step to protect the rights of those who are now in their country's service, and who, as defenders of the <rs>Government</rs>, deserve in return the control of the <rs>Government</rs> in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> The war commenced by the people of the <rs>North</rs> against slavery was really a war against the <rs>Constitution</rs> and against the <rs>Government</rs> based on that instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Slavery was recognized in the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and directly and indirectly the right of the owner in his slave was fully guaranteed by it. Any interference, therefore, by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> with the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, or with the right of the owner to his slave, was in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and as <num value="1">one</num> violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> acquiesced in would open the way for future interactions of it, it necessarily followed that the success of this anti-slavery movement would sweep away all the safeguards of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and leave the people of the country at the mercy of a bare majority, whose whims and caprices would be subject to no restraint.--The Constitution conferred upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs> no power to interfere with slavery in the <name>States</name>, or with the right of slave-holders to their property in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>; and so it followed, that any such interference was an assemblage of undelegated powers which, if submitted to, opened wide all the floodgates of usurpation, and prepared the way for a complete overthrow of the <rs>Government</rs> as founded by our fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>So the irrepressible conflict assumed proportions really far greater than the mere property interests involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The success of the anti-slavery movement would destroy, it is true, <measure n="4000000000dollars" type="currency">$4,000,000,000</measure> worth of property; it would do more, for it would overthrow the social institutions of <num value="15">fifteen</num> sovereign States and leave great districts of country now covered with prosperous towns and cities and teeming with evidences of agricultural wealth, a desert waste; but above all these, it was foreseen it would open the way for the overthrow of our constitutional government and the destruction of the liberties of the whole people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>If the rights of the owner of slave property were taken from him, what security could the owner of any other species of property have?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>If the institutions of slaveholding States might be overthrown by the exercise of undelegated power by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, what security was there for those or any other State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>If the <rs>General Government</rs> were permitted to do <num value="1">one</num> act for which it could find no warrant in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, what limit would there be on its power? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> The war on slavery was mangurated and conducted by able, sagacious, and ambitious men, who cared nothing for the condition of the slave, and was not influenced by any moral, or social, or political considerations, but who preferred using it to conceal their designs against the <rs>Constitution</rs> and against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>An open attempt to change the form of our Government they knew would alarm and arouse the whole people, and cover them with merited infamy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The liberties of the <name>Northman</name> were as dear as the liberties of the <name>Southman</name> &mdash; the freedom of the poor man was as much cherished as the freedom of the rich <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>All hated slavery alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>All equally loved liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>All were proud of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>All boasted of the glorious inheritance won for them by the heroes of the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Our institutions were regarded as the gift of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>It were folly to propose openly to overthrow the <rs>Government</rs> and reduce the people to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It were folly to propose to build a despotism on the ruins of the <rs>Republic</rs> and to rob the people of the birth-right of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Yet this was what the originators of the anti-movement desired to do; for this, abolitionism was conceived; for this, the anti slavery men of the past generation labored not less earnestly than those of today labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Keeping out of view the objects to be accomplished, they sought to array the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>, the non-slave-holder against the slaveholder, <num value="1">one</num> class and <num value="1">one</num> section against another class and another section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Clamoring against slavery in order to avert attention from their attacks on the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>They proposed measures which they knew were unconstitutional, knowing that every vote recorded on any pretext for an unconstitutional measure weakened the defences of that instrument and tended to the purpose they had in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The property interests at slake were so momentous that it absorbed the attention of the people; and while those directly interested in negroes and slavery were considering the social and economical results of the proposed nieasures, and showing by the most conclusive logic the disastrous effect upon the country of the emancipation of the slaves, the people of the <rs>Free States</rs> and the non-slaveholder in the <rs>South</rs> were being taught that they had no concern in the question.--The Constitution was forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The danger to the <rs>Government</rs> was overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The liberties of the people and the independence of the <name>States</name> were ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Fatal mistake! --Step by step the people were led on in the path marked out for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Finally, the free States in sold column gave their sanction to a policy that was in conflict with the <rs>Constitution</rs>, not intending to destroy the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but to cripple, and limit, and ultimately to destroy slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>They struck at slavery, and they pierced the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>They would have destroyed the rights of the slaveholder and their own liberties perished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>They consented that <num value="1">one</num> provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be violated; and soon it was announced that the whole instrument was suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>They agreed, never dreaming of the consequences, thinking only to &#x0022;lift the artificial weights&#x0022; from the shoulders of the slave, that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> might usurp <num value="1">one</num> power reserved to the <name>States</name>; and soon it had usurped every power so reserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>They acquiesced in the usurpation of uncirculated and reserved powers by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; and then they must needs stand by while all the powers delegated to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> or usurped by it, were usurped in turn by a single department of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Less than a year has elapsed since the people of the <rs>North</rs>, blinded and deceived by the arts of the master minds of the conspiracy against the <rs>Government</rs>, voted to disregard <num value="1">one</num> provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in order to enable them to abolish, sooner or later, slavery in the <rs>Southern States</rs>; and by a regular, but rapid process, as far as the free States are concerned, the <rs>Constitution</rs> has been swept away, the rights of the <name>States</name> have been blotted out, till power has been consolidated, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, in the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and next, in <num value="1">one</num> department thereof, the liberties of the people have been taken from them, and instead of a Federal Republic, a worse than <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> despotism rears its frightful form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> So rapid has been the strides of the <name>Revolution</name> that we can scarcely realize its progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It was only when the iron hand of the new Government was laid on our people, when the gates of its fortress-prisons had been closed on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of those they had loved and trusted, when bristling bayonets and mercenary soldiers before their eyes and around their homes, reminded them of the decree of their subjugation, that they awoke in a consciousness <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> of the situation of the country, and perceived the alternative presented to them &mdash; resistance to the death, or chains and slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Then they sprung to arms, and from their hills and valleys, and broad plains, and towns, and cities, turned out to defend their constitutional rights, to preserve their liberties, to maintain the independence of the <rs>State</rs>, and to protect their property, and homes, and families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Property is involved in the struggle, it is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The existence of slavery depends on the success of the <rs>Southern</rs> arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>But without property, without slaves, with nothing but our wives and little ones, and strong arms and stout hearts, we might be contented and happy, with <hi rend="italics">liberty</hi>--without liberty there can be no happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>We are all united in a struggle for liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>each equally interested, and each equally determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> --If we can believe the revelations of their own journals, the annual expenditures of the <rs>North</rs> for war and civil account are more than <num value="400">four hundred</num> mill <num value="1">one</num> of dollars, of which fully <num value="350000000">three hundred and fifty millions</num> are for war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It cannot be doubted that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Cameron,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Cameron,nomatch:0"><surname>Cameron</surname></persName></hi> are pursuing the settled purpose of making the war popular by expending large enough sums to bribe the whole Northern population. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> At <num value="1">one</num> time the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> presented the most lamentable picture of a great city's &#x0022;occupation gone;&#x0022; of suspended business stagnant affairs, idleness from want of employment, and general prostration and despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Recent advices from there, however, represent a total change to have come over the spirit of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Activity and thrift are again visible in the places they had forsaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The hum of industry and bustle of business again enliven its thoroughfares, and <address><street n="Wall Street">Wall street</street></address> and <address><street n="Broadway">Broadway</street></address> are again thronged by busy crowds of men in tent upon business and fortune. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> If we only assume that the finances of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> can be maintained under the heavy burdens with which the war is loading them, it is clear that <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> will not lose by the war so long as it lasts.--The export trade of the <rs>South</rs> before dissolution, counting her sales to the <rs>North</rs>, was about <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars: the greater portion of which was conducted directly or indirectly through the agency of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But the war expenditures of the <rs>North</rs> are said to exceed that enormous sum by <num value="25000000">twenty-five millions</num>; and this immense business also, except the mere pay of the soldiers, is conducted directly or indirectly through the agency of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>The profits of the city upon the trade of the <rs>South</rs>, though enormous and exorbitant, were regulated by conventional standards of percentage; those upon its trade in army supplies is of course restricted by no such regulations, and probably reach, on the great bulk of articles supplied, <num value="0.5">fifty per cent</num> of the sums exacted from the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> What is predicted of New York in regard to her profits on war expenditures, is true of the whole <rs>North</rs>; for <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> is but the agent of the people of the entire section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of Southern trade which they have lost, it is the <rs>Government</rs>'s shrewd purpose to compensate them for another form; and the war is attempted to be rendered even more popular than the peace which preceded it, by adding some <num value="0.25">twenty-five per cent</num> to the gross amount expended, and by the greater profits allowed upon war supplies than was earned upon Southern trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> It was long ago charged that the object of the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs> in bringing on hostilities was to make a job of the war for their hungry political partisans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Having once raised the winds they found it impossible to direct the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The war has assumed proportions which they had no dream of before, and the job which they had intended only for their peculiar partisans has been swollen to proportions large enough for the bribing of <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Passing along the main road <num value="1">one</num> sees on either side a Hue of old, dilapidated, and moss-covered houses, with narrow windows, creaking doors, broken shutters, and gable roofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The fences are broken down or entirely carried away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Everything has an air of the past, and there are very few indications of modern thrift or present prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Formerly it was a place of much note.
