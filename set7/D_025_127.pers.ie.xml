<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The morning of the <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num> came thick and foggy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> At <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> heavy cannonading was heard on our extreme right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Soon the battle raged furiously.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> During the hours between <time value="11am">11 A. M.</time> to <time value="5pm">5 P. M.</time> the firing of musketry and cannon was incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We have never heard it equalled on any field on which it has been our lot to do battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But their charges were unavailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Numbers of the men finding their guns so fouled as to be us less, cast them away and threw rocks into the faces of the foe. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> At <time value="4:30">half-past 4</time> P. M. an attack was made some distance down the ridge towards our centre, and judging from the terrible and rapid firing of musketry our forces were slowly retiring over the crest of the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The continuous and heavy firing was heard at <time value="5:30">half-past 5</time> P. M. when the train left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> We can form no estimate of our loss, though we know a large number of wounded were received at the field and general hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> turned their pale and bloody faces to the setting sun on the western slops of the ridge by so many hundreds, that we are satisfied that hell had <num value="1">one</num> of the grandest jubilees over its accessions from their ranks.

<head>The currency.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> The time for Congress to meet is rapidly approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The session will commence under circumstances calculated to cast a gloom over the deliberations of that body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The defeat of <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> has, it is true, been anticipated by the whole country ever since it was seen that he designed not only to make no use of the victory which he gained over <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> more than <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> ago, but that he was deliberately waiting for the enemy to collect the largest force they could possibly command before attacking him, and after that force had been concentrated, had ventured still further to increase the chances against him, by sending off the best corps of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Nevertheless the effect has been stunning to the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, who had so lately been told from the highest place in it that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> would spend the winter on the <rs>Ohio</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Meeting under such circumstances it is to be hoped that Congress will, if possible, forbear to waste the session in talk, and do something for the benefit of the public. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> The currency question will no doubt engage their earliest attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Every day they waste in talk will add a <num value="1000000.5">million and a half</num> to the volume of that currency which is apparently on the point of drowning us.--Can they not have patriotism enough to keep their mouths shut for a little while, until the business of the session can be dispatched?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>We should hope so, were we not warned by the experience of the last session. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> <num value="2">Two</num> prominent schemes are before the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The <num value="1">one</num> is the scheme of the <rs>Bank Directors</rs> who lately assembled at <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus</placeName>; the other that of <persName n="Stuart,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Both have been discussed in this paper, and we do not intend to enter afresh upon the examination of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Both of them have many good points, although if we were compelled to choose we should prefer the plan of <persName n="Stuart,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>But they both have the funding feature, which to us is a decided objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We greatly prefer a tax, with no after claps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We wish to see this debt wiped out as we go on, and no burthen thrown upon posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>If our Congress would march boldly up to the question, and take the bull at once by the horns, the financial difficulty could be settled in a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/><persName n="Stuart,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> estimates the circulation at <measure n="650000000dollars" type="currency">$650,000,000</measure>, and the property of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at <measure n="4000000000dollars" type="currency">$4,000,000,000</measure> specie valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>As the currency now stands, that is equal to <measure n="64000000000dollars" type="currency">$64,000,000,000</measure>. Now, we propose to raise a sum of <measure n="650000000dollars" type="currency">$650,000,000</measure> by a direct tax. It can be done by putting a little more than <num value="0.01">one per cent.</num> on the valuation of the above property, estimated in Confederate currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Such a tax would instantly enhance the value of our currency by increasing the demand for it. Now every body is seeking to get rid of it, lest it be left on his hands until its value be reduced to nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Then everybody would be seeking it, and the demand would enhance the value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>In a little time commodities would fall to their proper level, and the currency would perform all the functions of specie. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> We should still want a circulation of about <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure>. <num value="640000000">Six hundred and forty millions</num> would be too large a sum to withdraw, especially as the liberty to issue more would be taken away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Then regulate the tax so as to make it bring a sum less than the whole circulation by <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num>, whatever that circulation may be. As the notes are brought in let them be cancelled, and let there be no funding, no burthen on posterity, and no contemplation to repudiate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> The benefits that would flow from a bold system such as this would be invaluable.--It would establish our credit all over the world; for who could doubt the integrity of a people willing to lay such a tax on themselves for the sake of paying their debts?--Have not our Congressmen the nerve to try such an experiment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Are they afraid of their constituents?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>They ought to know &mdash; as <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> tells them in his letter to <persName n="Holmes,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> &mdash; that their constituents are in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Not only the army, but all the people desire to be taxed. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The approaching session of Congress.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> The country looks forward with profound solicitude to the approaching session of Congress for immediate action upon the currency, the great and vital question of the day.--We have already indicated what, in our opinion, is the policy which the necessities of the occasion require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We desire now only to express the hope that we shall have action and not debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>There is no time to be consumed in words or oratorical display.--Forensic exhibitions would be as much out of place in the present exigencies of our financial condition as on board a vessel drifting into the current that goes by <placeName key="possibilities=86" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Goat Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The roar of <placeName reg="Niagara, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002718">Niagara</placeName> is in our cars, and Congress must bend to the oars with as few words as possible, or we go headlong over the cataract. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> There are also certain things which it as important for Congress not to do as those which demand its immediate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It should abstain religiously from any exhibition of discord and faction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It should abstain from that qualification of the spirit of combativeness which may find legitimate food enough in the enemy who are thundering at our gates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>If we must quarrel and fight, there are <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> enough to satisfy all the longings of the most belligerent temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Let us not entertain our enemies and dishearten our friends by rancorous controversies and dissensions among ourselves, by grumbling and fault finding, by magnifying our disasters and insisting upon finding scapegoats among ourselves to bear the load of all our misfortunes and reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Such exhibitions have the worst possible effect ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>They discourage our friends, and induce the world at large to believe we are going to the dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>They have already had their influence in delaying our recognition abroad, and, if continued, will postpone that recognition indefinitely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We should show a united front in adversity as well as prosperity, and pull altogether, if we would escape the perils by which we are environed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Let Congress set an example to the country of harmony and forbearance, as well as of resolute determination to uphold our national honor and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Such an example is due to the great cause in which the interests of <num value="1">one</num> and all are alike involved, and to the brave men who are fighting our battles, and whose lofty courage and devotion should be stimulated and sustained by a compact phalanx in its rear of united public sentiment and harmonious cooperation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>To compel our own people to take up arms against their <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> own brethren is a refinement of cruelty which fills the last drop in the cup of bitterness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Those sections of our country which have thus far escaped being overrun by the enemy may see what they have to expect if they fall into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>There is no salvation for them but resistance to the death to the worse than savages who are bent upon destroying us from the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We can expect no mercy, no happiness, not a foothold upon the earth, unless we fight these fiends of hell with all the energy of our natures, and mete out to them at every opportunity the same measure they mete out to us. </p> </div3>
