<head>Report of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> War <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> reports that in the <num value="10">ten</num> military districts into which the <rs>South</rs> is divided by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the armies of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, according to official reports of a late date, numbers <num value="775000">775,000</num> men, and that since the date of these reports those numbers have been increased to <num value="800000">800,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The wonder is, not that they are so numerous, but that they should have done so little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/><num value="800000">Eight hundred thousand</num> men ought to conquer the world, and were they anything else than <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> they might be expected to do it still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is not formed for conquest, unless it be over tribes of wretched <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> says that when the quotas shall have been filled up, his army will number over a <num value="1000000">million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Of course he then expects to crush out the rebellion in less than <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>. With all this enormous force to back any enterprise, and with so little yet done, we had supposed the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> would say as little as might be of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Yet he commends the bravery and discipline of his troops, and the skill of their officers, calling to witness <persName n="York,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00281" reg="mostcommon:York,nomatch:0"><surname>York</surname></persName>, where <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00282" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName>, with <num value="8000">8,000</num> men, brought <num value="120000">120,000</num> of them to a halt, <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, where half the army was beaten by <orgName n="division"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00283" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, Fair Case, <placeName reg="Twymans Mill, Madison, Virginia" key="tgn,2114675">Gaines's Mill</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cross Keys, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2268788">Cross Keys</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2229381" n="1.000 504" reg="cedar mountain, culpeper, virginia">Cedar Run</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2111044" n="1.000 114" reg="chantilly, fairfax, virginia">Chantilly</placeName>, &#x0026;c., in even <num value="1">one</num> of which they were routed by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and, in consequence, were driven from before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, out of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and into <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Truly, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> impudence is a marvellous quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It glories in its own shame, and boasts even of its own defeats. --The next time we defeat the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, which will be the next time our troops meet theirs, we shall hear them ascribing their defeat to overwhelming numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>They will have forgotten all their <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> says now about their overwhelming superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>They will forget that he has told the world of his <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, ready to eat up the entire Confederacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> gives us a fuller view of the object the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are aiming at than we have yet seen officially averred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>They intend, it seems, to conquer the <rs>South</rs> to dispossess the inhabitants, and to settle it up with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>There are <num value="1000">thousands</num> of Blue <unclear> </unclear> it appears in the <rs>Northwest</rs> eager to begin the work of colonization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>This scheme does not involve the exile of the contraband, who is to stay among them, and work for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> employees at wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The <q>&#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="Saint">Saints</rs> of the <name>Earth</name>,&#x0022;</q>--that is to say, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--are thus to possess the whole earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>What is to become of the present inhabitants we are not told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It is said by the <rs>Secretary</rs>, however, that, as they have been guilty of treason, it is perfectly just to take everything they have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Hitherto the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have pretended to be working for the <unclear>tion</unclear> of slavery, but the <num value="11">eleven</num> to it is now fully revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The war is a war for prouder on a signatic scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>There has been nothing like it in modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The barbarians who destroyed the <unclear></unclear> Empire were the last who ever waged war for the extermination of the inhabitants and the occupation of that lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>We think the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>We shall certainly be, if the end of the war be not to exclude them forever from the possession of a foot of land in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It is plain, therefore, that the <rs>Secretary</rs> lies will fully and deliberately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>There can be no question that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00288" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> greatly underrated his loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName> said the loss reached <num value="28609">28,609</num>, and the <orgName n="Baltimore Clipper" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">Clipper</hi></orgName> estimated it at <num value="30000">30,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>That it very nearly reached that figure is rendered probable by the general opinion at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> lost more men, in proportion, on that occasion than they had in any other battle of the war, and their army was known to be <num value="150000">150,000</num> strong <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00289" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> severely censures <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00290" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> for not advancing and putting an end to the war by capturing or dispersing the whole of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00291" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>He did not advanced because he could not. His army had been too severely crippled to admit of it, it took him works to acquire reinforcements enough to fill up the gaps in his ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Had he advanced his whole army would have been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Had he really lost only <num value="10890">10,890</num> men out of <num value="150000">150,000</num>, (<num value="1">one</num> <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> only) does any man suppose he would not have advanced? </p>
