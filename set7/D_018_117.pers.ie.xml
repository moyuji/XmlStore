<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> It would have been well if the errors of the physicians had been confined to ignorance. --But their negligence was still more reprehensible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>While the poor maniac was deprived of those tender offices which his wife and daughters might have rendered, he was abandoned to the care of low mercenaries, and so little discrimination was observed in the choice of his attendants, that the charge of his person devolved chiefly on a <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> page, named Erast, who was utterly unworthy to be trusted with the humblest of his fellow creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>This man, who had been raised by the patronage of <name n="his Majesty" type="role">His Majesty</name>, repaid the kindness of his royal master with the most brutal ingratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>He went so far as to strike the helpless <rs>King</rs>, and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion when <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name> wished to protract his exercise in the gardens at <persName n="Kew,,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00000.00303" reg="mostcommon:Kew,nomatch:0"><surname>Kew</surname></persName>, Erast seized him in his arms, carried him into a chamber, and throwing him violently on a sofa, exclaimed in an insolent manner to his attendants: &#x0022;There is your king for you.&#x0022; These outrages were perpetrated in the seclusion of the palace at <persName n="Kew,,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00000.00304" reg="mostcommon:Kew,nomatch:0"><surname>Kew</surname></persName>, to which the <rs>King</rs> had been removed in the month of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, at the instance of the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/><name n="his Majesty" type="role">His Majesty</name> had been persuaded to leave <placeName reg="Windsor, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,2017612">Windsor</placeName>, to which he was much attached, by the promise that he should see his children at <persName n="Kew,,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00000.00305" reg="mostcommon:Kew,nomatch:0"><surname>Kew</surname></persName>. He entered the carriage cheerfully; but on passing through the iron gates of the Little Park, he put his hands before his face and burst into tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Recovering his composure, however, he talked to the equerries who accompanied him to the carriage in his ordinary hurried manner, pointing out the objects in the road, and anticipating the pleasure long denied him, of seeing his wife and daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>But on his arrival at <persName n="Kew,,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00000.00306" reg="mostcommon:Kew,nomatch:0"><surname>Kew</surname></persName> he found himself a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Proceeding towards the apartments he usually occupied, he was stopped and conducted into a large room, where he found the pages who were to be his keepers waiting to receive him. The equerries, among whom was his faithful and valued servant, <persName n="Harcourt,General,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00000.00307" reg="mostcommon:Harcourt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Harcourt</surname></persName>, according to the orders they had received, withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The physicians also, who had accompanied the royal patient from <placeName reg="Windsor, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,2017612">Windsor</placeName>, having consigned him to the charge of the pages, also thought proper to retire, and actually returned to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> the same night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The <rs>King</rs> then impatiently demanded to see his family; and the promise under which he had been induced to leave his Palace at <placeName reg="Windsor, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,2017612">Windsor</placeName> was in cruel mockery fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The Princesses were brought before the window; the <rs>King</rs>, on seeing them, rushed forward to lift the sash, but it was screwed down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>A paroxysm was the immediate consequence of this cruel restraint; the <name>Princesses</name> were hastily removed, and the <rs>King</rs> was dragged from the window, entreating to be allowed to speak to his children.--<hi rend="italics"><persName n="Massey,,,,," id="n-0001.0002.00000.00308" reg="mostcommon:Massey,nomatch:0"><surname>Massey</surname></persName>'s History of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
