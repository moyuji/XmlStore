<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The present war, he said, is emphatically <q>&#x0022;the people's war.&#x0022;</q> It is the effort of <num value="1">one</num> people to blot another from existence, and it becomes every man in the <rs>South</rs> to exercise every capacity in aiding the army which is preventing his becoming worse than a serf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He said, frankly, that the <rs>Government</rs>, while doing all it can, cannot compass as thorough relief for the army as the efforts of communities and individuals: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> In his appeal for contributions he alluded to those whose pursuits, positions, or opportunities had enabled them to make money in these times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Opportunities to realize unusual profits upon labor or capital, in particular pursuits or trades, were incidents of all wars, and this <num value="1">one</num> was no exception.--These were evils of war. They afford great temptations to frail human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>These temptations by every <num value="1">one</num> should be resisted as the approaches of the foul fiend. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> <persName n="Dickens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Dickens,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickens</surname></persName> had said the fumes of gold were more deadly to the moral sensibilities than the fumes of charcoal to the physical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was true none should think of making money or growing rich out of our common necessities; but every <num value="1">one</num> should feel and realize the fact that our common all is embarked in the common cause; that everything is at stake, and every <num value="1">one</num> should do his duty, and his whole duty, whether at home or in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Those at home, in whatever portion, have as important and as essential &mdash; though not so hard and dangerous &mdash; duties to perform as those in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>All should co-operate harmoniously and patriotically to the great end, and while they (the people of that community) had none among them known as speculators or extortioners, yet there were some whose pursuits enabled them, or afforded them, opportunities to realize larger profits on their capital and labor than in times of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>To such he made a special appeal to contribute liberally and generously, as he believed they would.--Let no <num value="1">one</num>, whether body corporate or not, think of making profits out of articles needed by the men in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The idea was abhorrent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> On the general subject of our present conflict, involving as it does our individual as well as national existence, he said all wars were calamities &mdash; the greatest that can be fall a people except perhaps direct visitations from <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, such as famines, plagues, and pestilence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The greater the war, the greater the calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>This war is a great calamity to us. We all feel it. It is the greatest war, and waged on the largest scale, of any since the birth of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The responsibility and guilt of it must be fearful somewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>As great calamities as wars are, they are, however, sometimes necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Often forced by the highest dictates of patriotism &mdash; like <q>&#x0022;offences,&#x0022;</q> we are told of &mdash; they sometimes needs come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>They are, however, never right or justifiable on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>They may be wrong on both sides, but can never be right on both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Unjust wars, by the unanimous consent of civilized men, are held, as they should be, in condemnation and reprobation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>People, therefore, as well as their rulers to whom such high trusts are confided, should look well to it, and see that they are right before appealing to this last and most terrific arbitrament of arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Some thoughts on this subject, <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> said, might not be out of place, even there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>These he dwelt upon at some length, showing the justice of our cause and the wanton aggression of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He traced the history of the controversy between the <rs>Southern</rs> and Northern States, the principles and nature of our Government, the independence and sovereignty of the <name>States</name>, and the right of each to control its own destinies and act for itself in the last resort, as each State might think best for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It was wholly immaterial, he said, in considering the question of right and justice, now to look any further than the solemn act of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs>, after mature deliberation, each acting for itself in its sovereign capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Each State had the right thus to act, and when each for itself had thus acted, no power on earth had the right justly to gainsay it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The old Union was formed by the <name>States</name>, each acting for itself in its sovereign character and capacity with the object and purpose of advancing their interests respectively thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Each State was the sole judge, in the last resort, whether the future interests, safety, and well being of her people required her to resume those sovereign powers, the exercise of which had been delegated to other hands under the old compact of Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>These principles have ever been held not only true, but sacred, with the friends of constitutional liberty in all the <name>States</name> since the old Union was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They rest upon that fundamental principle set forth in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, that all Governments <q>&#x0022;derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.&#x0022;</q> The States south, therefore, had nothing but what was their right &mdash; their inalienable right to do, the same as their ancestors did in common with the <rs>North</rs> when they severed their connection with the <rs>British Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> This war was waged by the <rs>North</rs> in denial of this right and for the purpose of conquest and subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It was, therefore, aggressive, wanton, and unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Such must be the judgment of mankind, let its results be what they may. The responsibility, therefore, for all its sacrifices of treasure and blood heretofore, or hereafter to be made in its prosecution, rests not upon us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. said that soon after the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs> duty called him to our camps near that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He went over the ground on which that conflict had taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The evidences of the late terrible strife were still fresh and <unclear></unclear> all around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The widespread desolation, the new-made graves, and the putrid animal remains not yet removed by the vultures, fully attested what a scene of blood it had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>while surveying the hills and defiles over which the various columns of men and the enemy passed, and were engaged on that memorable day, amongst many other things that crowded themselves upon his mind, were <num value="2">two</num> dying expressions reported to have been uttered in the midst of the battle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> <q>&#x0022;What is all this for?&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> said he could but think the question was pertinent to both sides, and most pertinent from him who uttered it, addressed to all his invading comrades and those who sent them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Well might he there, in the agonies of death, in the din and dust of strife, in the clangor of arms and the thunder of artillery, ask, <q>&#x0022;What is all this for?&#x0022;</q> Why this array of armies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Why this fierce meeting in mortal combat?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>What is all this carnage and slaughter for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The same question is still as pertinent to those who are waging this war against us as it was then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Why the prolongation of this conflict?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Why this immense sacrifice of life in camp and the numerous battles that have been fought since?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Why this lamentation and mourning going up from almost every house and family from <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, and from the <name>Atlantis</name> and <name>Gulf</name> to the <rs type="place">Lakes</rs>, for friends and dear ones who have fallen by disease and violence in this unparalleled struggle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The question, if replied to by the <rs>North</rs>, can have but <num value="1">one</num> true answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>What is all this for on their part but to overturn the principle upon which their own Government, as well as ours, is based &mdash; to reverse the doctrine that Governments derive their <q>&#x0022;just powers from the consent of the governed? &#x0022;</q> What is it for but to overturn the principles and practice of their own Government from the beginning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>That Government was founded and based upon the political axiom that all States and people have the inalienable right to change their forms of Government at will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> This principle was acted on in the recognition by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It was the principle acted on in the recognition of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It was acted on in the struggle of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, to overthrow the <name>Ottoman</name> rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>On that question the greatest constitutional expounder of the <rs>North</rs>, <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, gained his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> laurels as an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> statesman.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> Many at the <rs>North</rs> opposed the admission of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> as a State in our then Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>But there was little, if any, opposition to her recognition as an independent outside Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Strange to say, many of those who were then fiercest in their opposition to <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> coming into the <rs>Union</rs> are now the fiercest in their denial of the unquestioned right acknowledged to her before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Well may any and every <num value="1">one</num>, <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, exclaim, what is all this for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>What have we done to the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>When have we ever wronged them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>We quit them it is true, as our ancestors and their ancestors quit the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>We quit as they quit, upon a question of constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>That question they determined for themselves, and we have but done the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>What, therefore, is all this for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Why this war on their part against the uniform principles and practices of their own Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> plausible pretext for it; that is to exterminate our Southern institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It is to put the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> on an equality with the white man. It is to conquer and subjugate independent and sovereign States, who deny their authority rightfully to rule over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It is a war, in short, on their part, against right, against reason, against justice, against nature, and for nothing but power, conquest, and robbery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> If asked on our side, what is all this for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The reply from every breast is, that it is for home, for firesides, for our altars, for our birthrights, for property, for honor, for life &mdash; in a word, for everything for which freemen should live, and for which all deserving to be freemen should be willing, if need be, to die. Such, doubtless, were the feelings which prompted the other exclamation on that bloody <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> field to which reference has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/><q>&#x0022;Boys,&#x0022;</q> said the dying <rs>Bartow</rs>, <q> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">they have killed me,</hi> but never give it up.&#x0022;</q> The same sentiments animated the breast of every gallant son of the <rs>South</rs> who poured forth his life- blood in achieving that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> signal and glorious victory to our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Those who survived them did not give it up, until they succeeded in driving back the invader, the aggressor, the despoiler and robber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Both exclamations may well be treasured as mementoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>In whatever trials and sacrifices this war may bring upon us, when the thought of <q>&#x0022;what is all this for, &#x0022;</q> comes to the mind, recollect that it is, on our part, for everything most dear and sacred; and whatever reverses may await us, in a struggle for such objects, let the watchword of the last survivors be, <q>&#x0022;never give it up!&#x0022;</q> Let the world know, and history record the fact if such should be our unhappy fate, that though our country may be invaded, our land laid waste, our cities sacked, our property destroyed, the people of the <rs>South</rs> could die in defence of their rights, but they could never be conquered. </p> </div3>
