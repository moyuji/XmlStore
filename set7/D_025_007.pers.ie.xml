<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We are without farther information from the great battle said to have been fought on Sunday than that which came <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and which we publish in the proper column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The report of the returned prisoner, who overheard the officers at <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> say they had sustained a loss of <num value="60000">60,000</num> men, though otherwise of little value, is useful as confirmatory evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We have no means of testing the accuracy of the dispatch from <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Correspondents &mdash; especially telegraphic correspondents &mdash; with the best intentions, are often led estray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They are obliged, in the absence of official intelligence, to depend on the evidence of persons from the scene of action, who are often but imperfectly informed themselves, and sometimes on mere rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They therefore, in such cares, state their authority, and let the public judge of the value of their information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In the present instance, the very enormity of the loss in prisoners attributed to the enemy excites incredulity, although no man doubts that the reporter stated accurately the prevalent belief in <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName> at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We feel as well assured that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, if he has met the enemy in a pitched battle, has inflicted a terrible defeat upon them, as we do that we are living, breathing, sentient beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Whether the details be precisely such as the telegraph gives us is another matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>If <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has, after a hard fought battle, taken <measure n="40000" type="prisoners">40,000 prisoners</measure>, he has gained <num value="1">one</num> of the most complete victories on record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He has utterly destroyed the only obstacle that stood between him and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and we can see no reason why he should not be in that city before to-morrow night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The force to defend it consists entirely of militia, many of them but ill affected, and they have within the city a deadly enemy, as numerous as themselves, panting for revenge and ready to rise on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In the panic which must follow such an astounding overthrow nothing can be easier than to march in and take possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We are confident that <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has struck some great blow from the strong belief generally entertained that he has all this time been acting upon a certainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He would never have ventured upon a march, apparently so hazardous as that into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, had he not well calculated all the chances beforehand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>What serves to convince us that a battle was fought and a victory gained on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, is the account given in the telegram of the movement made by the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hill,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It corresponds with the accounts given in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers, that he had been repulsed.--The truth seems to be that he made a retrograde movement pursuant to orders, in order to reduce the enemy to follow him. They did so, according to the telegram, when the wings of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> closed upon and enveloped them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was a repetition of the man&#x0153;avre practiced by <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> at Cant&#x00E6; which resulted in the slaughter of <num value="70000">70,000</num> <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> and the capture of <num value="14000">14,000</num> out of an army of <num value="86000">86,000</num> <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> killed the enveloped <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, according to this account, only took the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> If this telegram states the truth in its full extent, not only <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, but <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> likewise must speedily fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> once in our possession, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> cannot possibly sustain itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We shall then have redeemed <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and rendered her an efficient ally, instead of leaving her in the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>She can furnish as with <num value="50000">50,000</num> troops equal to any in the world, burning with hatred, and eager to avenge the countless wrongs and indignities which they have suffered at the hands of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The war will then be permanently transferred to the enemy's territory, and in a few months we may confidently expect to see the <rs>Confederate</rs> banner waving in triumph over the city of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We already begin to see glimpses of peace, if this telegram prove only half true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But let us have no peace which we do not dictate ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The refusal of the <rs>Captain</rs> of the flag boat to let any <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers go on shore is proof almost positive that they have sustained some great disaster. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It is evident, from the intelligence which we publish in another column, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> begins to feel the pressure of the iron-hand which <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> has cast around him. The passage of the Big Black by <orgName n="command"><persName n="Osterhaus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Osterhaus,nomatch:0"><surname>Osterhaus</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, and its attempted passage by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry at <placeName reg="Birdsong's Ferry">Birdsong's Ferry</placeName>, were, doubtless, designed to break through it. Whether these movements will be followed by the advance of Grants whole army remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Should it be, he will no doubt leave a force to keep up the blockade of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But the withdrawal of a large portion of his forces will offer a fine opportunity for a sally.
