<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Something more is involved in the issue of this conflict than the question of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is to settle our rank in the human race; to show whether it be really true, as asserted by some philosophers, that the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> stamina degenerates in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, and that <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> are inferior in profoundness of passion, tenacity of purpose, and strength of endurance, to the people of the Old World. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> It is common, in some parts of this continent, to look down upon the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as inferior to this free, intelligent and virtuous <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>And no portion of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> populations was held in more sublime contempt than &#x0022;the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>,&#x0022; a name applied to all inhabitants of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, a race which, however it may have been corrupted of late by infidelity and Red Republicanism, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most manly heroical and conquering races of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Surely, we are not going to allow our contest to be thrown into the shade by those Dutchiest of Dutchmen, the people of the New Netherlands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Have we forgotten the long years of their protracted and desperate struggle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>How they contended against immensely greater odds than we are compelled to encounter in this contest; how, pressing them from post to post, was that wonderful military genius, the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7003131;tgn,2052940" n="0.121 000000.3636	placename;tgn,7003131;parma,Emilia-Romagna,Italia,Europe;0.030 000000.0909	placename;tgn,2052940;parma, michigan,Jackson,Michigan,United States,North and Central America" reg="parma,Emilia-Romagna,Italia,Europe;parma, michigan,Jackson,Michigan,United States,North and Central America">Parma</placeName>, a man born to command; greatest among the great captains whom the military schools of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> had given to the world, with an eagle's face, and moving with an eagle's wings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Do we remember those patriots reduced to such an extremity that they offered to give their country to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> if she would save them from <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> refused the offered gift; and that while their envoys were absent, soliciting foreign intervention, and refreshing themselves, after the manner of ambassadors, with feasting and frolicking, the people at home were eating rats, and cats, and dogs, and the weeds from the pavements, and the grass from the churchyards?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>And have we forgotten that, in defiance of all this, they held out to the bitter end, and that, at last, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> having tried their faith and manhood in the fiery furnace <num value="7">seven</num> times heated, rewarded them finally with liberty and independence! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Nor are these the only examples which the same race have afforded of achievements that we would do well to equal before we settle down in the pleasing conviction that <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> are the greatest of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Do we not remember how <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, with a population of scarcely <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of inhabitants, carried on a <num value="7">seven</num> year's war, from <dateStruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></dateStruct>, against the combined forces of <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Sverige" key="tgn,1000097">Sweden</placeName> and <placeName reg="Saxony" key="tgn,7003685">Saxony</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In the course of this war, with far inferior forces, he was under the necessity of meeting superior forces, as sailing him at all points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In the battle near Leu then, he had only <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> to oppose <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num>; and in both these instances, he gained most signal victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But he had many sad reverses, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> as in the battle of Hotchkirk, in which he was defeated by the <name>Austrians</name>, losing many of his best officers, a large number of his best troops, and all his baggage and ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>His enemies appeared to be inexhaustible in men and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Yet <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> triumphed, and lived to see his country independent and more prosperous than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Surely we, who are fighting under no such disadvantages, who have been subjected to no such disasters and trials, need not fail unless we are inferior in spirits, patriotism and endurance to those benighted and outlandish <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves driving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> The late freshet has not only seriously interfered with military movements, but, for a time, it put a complete stop to all travel by railway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Nearly every part of this town was under water, while the whole of <placeName reg="Hamburg, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099435">Hamburg</placeName>, on the opposite side of the river, was submerged to the depth of <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure>. The people in both places are still engaged in pumping out the water from the cellars and repairing the damages done by the flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Now that the railways have been put in running order again, the rush of travelers and mail matter is overwhelming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The trains, station-houses, hotels and wayside homes are overflowed by the mighty multitude, crowding and jostling each other; and he is considered a happy mortal who secures standing-room in a box-car, or a chair at a hotel on which to snatch a little sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>So much for the freshet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> The injury done by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to the railway lines in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> has not yet been repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>No effort has been made thus far to relay the track of the <orgName n="Georgia Central Railroad" type="railroad">Georgia Central railroad</orgName> between <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>, a station <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName></placeName>, and <persName n="Millen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Millen,nomatch:0"><surname>Millen</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Until these gaps can be closed up, the <rs>Government</rs> is forced to rely upon wagon trains, which are doing all that could be expected at this rainy period of the year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> But the heavy rains have embarrassed the operations-of the enemy as well as of ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The freshet which did so much damage to bridges and railways in the hill country, where the water was confined to narrow channels, upon approaching the coast, spread out over wide tracts of level country, and rendered all movements across the direction of the water-course wholly impossible for sometime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>For this reason there need be no apprehensions of an immediate raid from <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> into <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Georgia</placeName>, the teeming granary of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>This enforced delay on the part of the enemy will give our authorities time to prepare for a movement into that part of the <rs>State</rs>, which there is every reason to believe will be undertaken as soon as the waters subside. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> It were folly to attempt to disguise the fact that there is very great discontent in this State and in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>With trifling exceptions, there is no desire on the part of the people for a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>; but candor compels me to say there is wide and deep-seated dissatisfaction at the management of public affairs, which, if not timely checked, threatens to produce the gravest disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>I shall not under take to say whether this discontent is the result of unavoidable military reverses, or of mismanagement by our civil and military authorities, or of the teachings of a factious press, which thinks it a light affair to destroy the confidence of the people in their leaders, or of the sordid spirit of gain which has taken such a hold upon the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It may be that all of these causes have combined to produce the deplorable state of dissatisfaction, despondency and faction in which I have found the people all along my circuitous route from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>But that great discontent does prevail, and that it threatens, like a cloud overcharged with electricity, to vent itself upon the nearest object &mdash; possibly upon the cause itself, which now engages every patriot's heart &mdash; there is not the shadow of a doubt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> The opinion here expressed has not been hastily formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It has been more than a month since the writer left <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; he has mingled freely with people of all shades of opinion; with the friends as well as with the opponents of the <name>Administration</name>; and he is painfully convinced that he does not exaggerate when he says that the authorities at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> must concede something to popular sentiment &mdash; that the press must be more reticent and forbearing, remembering that it is <num value="1">one</num>-thing to criticise the conduct of public men and point out their errors as we would those of a friend, and quite another thing to denounce them and destroy their power for future good &mdash; and that the standard of private virtue and public morals must be elevated, and the people called away from the groves and high places where <placeName reg="Mammon">Mammon</placeName> is worshipped, and where patriotism is bartered away for gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>If something like this be not done; if, in other words, a remedy for existing disorders be not found and speedily applied, those in authority, as well as the press and the people, may live to see the day when they will call upon the rocks and mountains to fall upon them and hide them from the consequences of their own infatuation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> People in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, at the time I left the capital, had but a faint idea of the real condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The Administration itself did not begin to realize the estimation in which it is held by the country &mdash; whether rightfully or wrongfully, I need not now stop to consider. --The fact is what I am after, and the fact is as I have stated it to be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> Such is the malady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>What is the remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Patience and firmness on the part of the people; reticence, forbearance and judicious criticism on the part of the press; and conciliation and a generous confidence on the part of the <rs>Government</rs>, and an energetic administration of military affairs, so that all the <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> resources of the country, whether of men or material,--and of men, whether <rs type="color">black</rs> or <rs type="color">white</rs>,--shall be made available in the struggle for our liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together, would secure our independence as surely as to-morrow's sun will rise and set. </p> <closer> <signed>P. W. A.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>They dismounted; and of all scenes I ever witnessed, this was the most revolting.
