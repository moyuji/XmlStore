<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It was currently reported yesterday morning that a force of the enemy had landed at the <placeName key="tgn,7014664;tgn,2115169;tgn,2115031;tgn,2113715;tgn,2110221" n="0.200 000001.0000	placename;tgn,7014664;Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.200 000001.0000	placename;tgn,2115169;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.200 000001.0000	placename;tgn,2115031;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.200 000001.0000	placename;tgn,2113715;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.200 000001.0000	placename;tgn,2110221;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">White House</placeName>, and out of this grew a rumor that a body of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> strong, were advancing in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> by way of <orgName n="Bottom's Brigade"><persName n="Bottom,Brigade,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Bottom,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigade"></roleName><surname>Bottom</surname></persName>'s Brigade</orgName>, and that <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName> county was again invaded by the foe. We met, last evening, a gentleman from <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, who crossed the brigade at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He states that there has not been a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> at that place for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, nor has there been a gunboat in sight at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> or Capable, on the <rs>York</rs>, for the same length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This we consider an ample and satisfactory contradiction of the report circulated in the morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Through the same source we learn that the enemy are removing their guns from <unclear></unclear> Point, and making apparent preparations for evacuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Not long since the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> constructed a line of telegraph through <placeName reg="Gloucester, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002411">Gloucester county</placeName>, but removed it without making any use of it. The object of this is supposed to have been to communicate with <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> when he made his base of supplies at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>; but his sudden change to the <rs>Southside</rs> rendered its completion unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is currently reported, also, that the enemy are evacuating <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and removing their stores from that place as rapidly as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> A heavy rumor prevailed yesterday to the effort that <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington, North Carolina</placeName>, had been captured and occupied by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We only mention it for the purpose of pronouncing it utterly untrue, since some simple minded people seem ready enough to believe anything, no matter how doubtful its authorship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>There are persons in this community who have no better occupation than inventing and circulating rumors, and however gross or absurd their character, they are readily swallowed by those who do not take the trouble to inquire whence they started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If these professional news mongers could be identified, they should be sent to the front without delay, and made to perform the service which they expect of others. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>From <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The quiet on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> continues unbroken by any event fore shadowing a general engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Our troops and the enemy are so near to each other at many points that a stone might almost be hurled from <num value="1">one</num> line of entrenchments to the other; and thus the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> remain perfectly docile, held at bay by our Valiant army, and apparently puzzled as to what course to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The enemy, however, continue their villainous practice of shelling the city with steadiness and perseverance, but have thus far accomplished comparatively little by this mode of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The missiles have been increased in size, and on Wednesday the inhabitants were surprised by a succession of <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pounders, crashing in their very midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The rumor that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was evacuating his position in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> has been revived, but this idea is purely imaginary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He could not, consistently with his professions or with safety to his reputation, abandon all the advantages which he claims to have gained by his last strategic move, without striking a single blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Thus he will remain there, subjecting his army to the danger of decimation from the diseases incident to the estimate, and perhaps try to dig his way into <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, or, possibly eventually send his men forward to certain death from Confederate bullets and bayonets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Meanwhile, we have something to hope for in the fact that the enemy are suffering greatly for water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The correspondents of Northern journals complain of this want, deserters refer to it, and persons who have <unclear></unclear> during a greater portion of their lives in the section now occupied by the enemy say that in sessions of drought like the present even the sparsely scattered population of the county feel most keenly the absence of water <unclear></unclear> has a large army between <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and the <num value="2">two</num> rivers, with <num value="1000">thousand</num> of horses, and the reader can form some idea of the quantity of aqueous fluid acquired for the sustenance of this vast mutiute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Disease will soon make its appearance, and add a <num value="1000">thousand</num> fold to their trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The want of water is <num value="1">one</num> which even <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ingenuity will fail to supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><unclear></unclear> more favored localities, wells might holding, and other means resorted to in order to believe their parching thirst; but our information is that the county of <placeName reg="Prince George, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002805">Prince George</placeName> abounds in no perpetual springs, lobbing up for the nourishment of man, and beast, while the dealing out of whiskey rations, for which <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is said to be famous, will but increase the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We see no prospect for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their present position but to dry up and wither under the scorching rays of the sun of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The &#x0022;clouds of dust&#x0022; on the lines of the enemy, so frequently alluded to of late as indicating some important movement, are now supposed to signify nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The condition of the earth, under the influence of a protracted drought, is such that any movement whatever, any change of position or countermarching of a division, would be sufficient to raise &#x0022;clouds of dust.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The <hi rend="italics">Express</hi> into rids us that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been summarily deprived of a screen from behind which they were enabled to carry on offensive operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Our troops were much annoyed by the enemy's sharpshooters, who were securely sheltered behind a barm on the <rs type="place">Spring Garden Farm</rs>, near the <placeName key="possibilities=23" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Baxter</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Permission was asked to knock this barn to pieces, but refused by the officer in command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Finally consent was obtained, and a battery of our artillery opened upon it. A few minutes sufficed to send the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> flying from their shelter, and presently the entire structure tumbled to the ground, revealing a couple of mortars also, from which our lines had been subjected to considerable annoyance. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Sported success in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> We are enabled to state, on what we consider good authority, that our forces in the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> last, surprised and captured the enemy's garrison at <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg, Berkeley county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>An officer who has arrived at <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> reports that <measure n="900" type="prisoners">900 prisoners</measure>, <num value="4">4</num> piece of artillery, and <num value="250">250</num> wagons were taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> of that place were making extensive preparations to celebrate the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and had the materials for a sumptuous banquet, all of which, including the wine with which they <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> designed to drink &#x0022;the day we celebrate,&#x0022; fell into the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Although no official information of this capture has been received, it is generally credited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName> is the point to which the enemy sent all the negroes stolen from their masters on their recent visit to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, and it is quite probable that they will be returned to their old homes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Since the above was written we have learned that a <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, has been received in the city, which announces the capture of <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>, but says the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio railroad</orgName> was up that to time uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>There is no doubt, however, that <persName n="Mosby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Mosby,nomatch:0"><surname>Mosby</surname></persName> has been operating upon that line of communication. </p> </div4>

The news is announced this morning by telegraph, and there can now be no harm in alluding to it. An official dispatch received yesterday states that our army is about a mile this side of <placeName key="tgn,2022328" n="1.000 6" reg="campbellton, fulton, georgia">Chattahoochee river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> A few days ago there lay, as there still lie in the <rs>Mersey</rs>, <num value="2">two</num> enormous masses which <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago would have been astonishing, if not ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Encased in massive iron, they are furnished with prows, or beaks, of a form and purpose familiar enough to schoolboys, but till lately exploded in modern warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>People are slow not only to learn, but even to reflect and to remember, and when it had taken <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> to remind our naval builders that a ship of war could be moved with steam as well as with <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="5">five</num> banks of oars, it took a longer time for our Admiralty to perceive that the revival of the trireme gave us the opportunity of reviving the rostrum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>But here, at last, were <num value="2">two</num> rams capable of doing as much mischief on their own element as the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,1121365" n="1.000 10" reg="Aries,Romania,Europe">Aries</placeName></hi> of ancient siege operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>No doubt they were meant for the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and were to be employed in the destruction of blockading squadrons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> A splendid career &mdash; not so brilliant, indeed, as that of the <rs>Alabama</rs>, but not less useful &mdash; awaited them; but they had already a history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Consuls had watched their growth, and spies had found their way on deck; correspondence had grown into blue-books about them; the telegraphic wires had been kept continually at work upon them; finally, they had been actually seized; the highest responsibility of the <name>Crown</name> had been exercised against them, and had been met by litigation, by suits in various courts, by debates in both Houses, by a correspondence between <num value="2">two</num> worlds, and, as if reality were not enough, forgeries and romances had gathered like barnacles about the monstrous hulls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>They had been built on speculation, it was alleged, by a <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs>; they had been ordered by the <name>Pasha</name> of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; they were simply articles on sale, like a couple of steam plows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Who could say what and whom they were not for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The wits of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and New York were busily hoaxing the anxious public with alleged reports and correspondence about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The British Government was menaced with heavy damages for seizing them; with a Confederate quarrel for stopping a legal transaction; with a Federal war for allowing the equipment of ships of war; with a Parliamentary defeat and expulsion from office for doing either <num value="1">one</num> thing or the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Could the twin rams have been conscious of anything, could a thought or a sensation have pierced their thick epidermis, they might have been proud to occupy the attention of mankind and affect the destines of Governments and nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>But all at once, myth and mystery, litigation and debate, diplomacy and war subsided and disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Nothing remained but the solid hulls and impassible iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The stroke of a pen across a slip of paper conveyed these famous ships, with all their Habilitates and engagements, to the possession of her Britannic Majesty, and condemned them to a life of rolling and repairing, pulling to pieces and patching up, a slow decay, and an inglorious death in <num value="1">one</num> of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> dockyards, without having once crushed in the flank of a hapless foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> This is a quick and easy solution of a great difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The impatient public, always looking forward and asking &#x0022;What next,&#x0022; has been taken aback by the discovery that nothing now is coming, and half a dozen careers, fortunes, controversies, and suits have been capped by an extinguisher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>A whole illumination, not to say a possible conflagration, has been put out. The Rams are now as dark as their hundreds of brethren lying in ordinary, waiting for some possible resurrection to the light of day. Even after the announcement last week there was a lingering hope the fire might break out in some form or other.--It was hoped that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government might be found to have compounded felony, or might be still liable to costs for the seizure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>But the previous proceedings, hostile enough in effect, were only against the innocent Rams, not against their owners, while, by the possession of the <unclear></unclear> the new owners inherited themselves any possible claims in respect of the seizure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> The purchase is comprehensive and conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>For &#x00A3;<num value="220000">220,000</num>, it appears, Government has become possessed of <num value="2">two</num> tremendous engines which we most devoutly hope, and most certainly expect, it will never have the least occasion for. But, though this concludes everything as between Government and the <rs>Federal</rs>, the <rs>Confederates</rs> and <persName n="Laird,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Laird,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Laird</surname></persName>, it leaves Parliamentary speakers something to say still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Is not the precedent dangerous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Will not men now build all sorts of infernal devices on the speculation that if no belligerent will take them our own Government will?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>How that may be we know not, but <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> may congratulate itself on the possession of private ship building yards capable of turning out such monsters of the deep, even without an immediate demand, and with the purchaser still to present himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The possession of such yards is worth far more than the possession of the ships themselves, for the ships may be destroyed or wrecked, but the yards will remain, and will always be capable of repairing our losses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> The stoppage of these rams, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by mere force, then by quiet purchase, is all that we have been enabled to do in the enforcement of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It is a strange comment on neutrality laws that all we can do, whether by stretch of authority or by good management, reaches only the least offensive and most purely defensive munition of war. We cannot prevent the emigration and practical enlistment of men, or the sale of instruments of destruction of all kinds, great and small, or the sale of fast ships, convertible into cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>All that we can prevent is the sale of ships meant to act only on the defensive, for the protection of ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The Federal, it appears, may have procured from us every ship, every man, every gun, every shot and shell, every ounce of powder, every cutlass employed in blockading a Confederate port; but if the <rs>Confederates</rs> want the meas of sallying forth and sinking the foe at their gates, they must not come to this country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> The ram is only a floating fortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It is incapable of a long voyage, or even of blockade duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It can only just do, as it were, militia work, and make an occasional sally against a beleaguering host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Yet this comparatively harmless engine, which cannot take the initiative, and which meets the active operations of war with a simple negative, is the only thing that we succeeded in withholding from the belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>With the state of the law we quarrel not. We can only submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>But it is, to say the least paradoxical, and we look to time to re-adjust the law to common sense. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> If he had been victorious, he would certainly be much nearer the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> than he is to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>By moving in the direction indicated above, there would have been no <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> in his path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Indeed, he seems to have carried the flanking business a little too far this time, and to have rushed against an obstacle which there was no need for him to encounter at all. And I find that many of the officers have the impression that when he has demonstrated to his satisfaction the fact that <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is too hard a nut to crack, he will &#x0022;change his base&#x0022; again, and, crossing his army to <placeName reg="Harrison's Landing, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2378614">Harrison's Landing</placeName>, commence from that point a new campaign against <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p>
