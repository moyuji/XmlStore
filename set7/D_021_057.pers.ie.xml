<head>Destroying cotton and tobacco.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The burning of the cotton and tobacco is a weapon in Southern hands more powerful for retribution, than an army of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men. There is no exaggeration whatever in this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We could do no such damage to the enemy, we could not so disappoint and baffle him, by any number of victories, as by the annihilation of cotton and tobacco, rather than permit it to fall into his possession.--From defeats in arms he could rally, as he has rallied; but the loss of cotton and tobacco would be an irreparable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is not the <q>&#x0022;glorious Union&#x0022;</q> he is fighting for; he is not trying to shoot and bayonet us back from love of us; he must have cotton and tobacco, or his commerce and manufactures tumble to the dust, and with them, in <num value="1">one</num> grand crush, the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>When <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> says he is fighting for the principles of his forefathers, he simply means the interests of their posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>To seize the tobacco and open a cotton-port are the darling objects of his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He has a soul that is so constructed as to take especial delight in appropriating that which is not his. It is just the sort of speculation that fascinates a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> imagination, this seizing cotton, tobacco, and other things obtained and garnered by other people's labor, without any trouble or expense on his part.--Like a bear that devours the store of honey that the bee has been a year in laying up, or a wolf that ravens in the sheep-fold, or a mink in the chicken coop, he is all the more delighted with the spoil, that he has to make no compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But if the bee had the power of destroying its honey, the bear would probably go home in a very enviable mood, and the shepherd and the farmer would show themselves as silly as their own sheep and chickens if they did not kill them themselves, rather than permit them to fall into the clutches of beasts of prey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> We feel sure that the sagacious and spirited people of the <rs>South</rs> will not sit quietly and permit the <rs>Northern</rs> bears to break into the <rs>Southern</rs> hive and stuff themselves with the grand stores of honey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Let us never forget that no earthly power but ourselves can prevent us from defeating the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the grand object of the war, and in visiting <hi rend="smallcaps">Retribution</hi> upon them, and the very kind of retribution which, of all others, they most dread and will most keenly feel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They have brought themselves financially to the verge of destruction by this war, and the only balm that can heal their wounds, the only plaster that can soothe as inflammation which will otherwise run into gangrene is the cotton and the tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Shall we apply the balm and the plaster?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Shall we restore to life the wounded serpent which is seeking to sting us to death? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> We have a higher opinion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>If they should be overrun by these Northern hordes, they will apply the torch to every pound of tobacco and to every bale of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>And in that glorious readiness for self-sacrifice lies their salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Such a people cannot be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Let us stand serene, self-possessed, immutably resolved, with the sword in <num value="1">one</num> hand and the torch in the other. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We have been led to believe that a feeling of decided hostility to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> exists among the people, and that the <rs>Government</rs> is strongly against all claims for recognition.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Everybody-who-has thought, talked and read much about <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> of late, must feel that <name>English</name> opinions on the subject, as rendered by the tone of our press, have been qualified by the medium that <unclear></unclear> them.--Nobody in private life talks about out <q>&#x0022;trans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Atlantic kinsmen,&#x0022;</q> nobody desires to claim familiarities with the performers on the barbarous dances which the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> nation executes around its idols of the hour, any more than with the worshippers of Mumbo Gumbo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Our conversion on this subject is not silly or sentimental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>We do not speak of the least sanguinary of civil wars as <q>&#x0022; the terrible and fraternal struggle which is drenching <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> with blood.&#x0022;</q> It is not in fact, as is sometimes asserted in print and in public speeches, that every <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> worthy of the name deplores the separation between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The view commonly taken by <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>; who do not on that account consider themselves unworthy of the name, is that every day tends to justify the judgment and policy of the <rs>South</rs> in withdrawing from a system, the results of which are what we contemptuously witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We do not desire above all things, that the struggle should be at once concluded, no matter how; because a conclusion which would leave the <rs>South</rs> at the mercy of a vindictive, unfair, and ungenerous enemy, would gratify nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>We do not lament over the unexampled display of weakness made by the <orgName n="Great Republic" type="newspaper">Great Republic</orgName>, because we know that such weakness existed, and it is not for the interest of truth nor of the world that it should any longer be disguised, or allowed to vaunt itself as a matchless force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Nor do we, as a people, desire to accept any slight, shifty pretence of reparation for the recent ruffianly outrage, which may be held by some among us, to whom honor is but a fantastic name, to absolve us from the necessity of war, for previous insults from the same quarter still remain unstained for; and now that we have, at enormous cost, and with patient and self-denying efforts, amassed an armament which adequately represents the power of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, we should have no objection to employ it in administering a sharp chastisement to the vainglorious people who have so often cheaply defied us. Sentiments conciliatory even to poltroonery, and pacific even to disgrace, are frequently ascribed to us; yet they have no real origin in the heart of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It would be impossible for the national vanity of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, hungry as it is, to extract any nourishment from what is expressed on the subject in the conversation of intelligent <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>When they read the speeches of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> public men, and the articles of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> newspapers, they feel only scorn for the blind followers to whom such blind guides are possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>They are unable to see anything peculiarly tragical in the fact that half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men have been brought together in arms to hurl big words at each other across a river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>What truth can there be in the plea of relationship as an inducement to conceal our real sentiments, when we so loudly derided our own fellow-subjects of the <orgName n="Irish Brigade" type="brigade">Irish brigade</orgName>, who went forth from among us to make themselves ridiculous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>And why should we conceal our contempt when absurdities far more mischievous, and on an immensely extended scale, are committed by those whom twaddling sentimentalists term our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cousins? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> * * * * * * </p> 
<p> It is a remarkable fact, and <num value="1">one</num> that may puzzle future historians, that, in the same year, we, a people, having no more sympathy with mob rule than with despotism, viewed the downfall of despotic dynasties, not only without pity, but with derision and contempt, yet preserved a respectful demeanor, while a worse and more hopeless tyranny was every hour growing more despicable and ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>We discuss the statecraft of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> as if it were really directed by statesmen capable of planning and executing operations of finance and policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>We speak of the operations of their army, and the designs of its leaders, as if they had established a claim upon the consideration of a sensible people who have some reputation in war. We repeat or refute the assertions, prophecies and denunciations of their orators and journalists, as if any human being, even the speakers and writers themselves, could consider them entitled to a particle of credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The apparent consequence is, that they imagine they are impressing the old, decried and worn-out powers, who have so long regarded their great and free institutions with envy, with a profound respect for their military skill, their wonderful sagacity, the unrivalled perfection of their political system and their indisputable claim to be regarded as foremost among the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Through their politicians, their journals, their public meetings, and their actions, they frankly write themselves down as they are in the broadest characters yet we refrain from accepting the description given on such undeniable authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It is in vain that they gesticulate, tumble, and perform the most extravagant antes; we persist in regarding the dreary farce as a grand melodrama, or even a tragedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>We, who ground our best claims to consideration as a nation on the great men, great actions, great principles, which illustrate the massive volume of our history grant the claim of this people to greatness on the single ground of material prosperity.--And although happily we are as far removed from universal suffrage as from autocracy, and although the aspect in which republicanism appears unmistakably in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> has caused the democratic tendencies of our own institutions to be powerfully arrested, yet we continue to appear reluctant to draw from passing events deductions which would seem to reflect upon democracy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> This course we believe to have been injudicious and unfortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Had the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> been permitted to see the true reflections of our minds &mdash; had they been aware of the extent and depth of the contempt with which we have regarded their doings &mdash; it could scarcely have failed to modify their conduct of the civil war. Nor, as a question of policy when we would avoid war, do we think it advisable to dwell on our pacific disposition as the key-note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>To profess a disinclination to fight, is not the best way to deal with a bully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Even were it true that we would sacrifice everything for peace and that <persName n="Bright,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Bright,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Bright</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cobden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Cobden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Cobden</surname></persName> and <persName n="Peace,Mister,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Peace,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><foreName n="Joseph">Jos.</foreName> <surname>Peace</surname></persName> were the great representatives of <name>English</name> feeling, it would be impolitic to say so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>But when we are giving proof of our readiness for war on sufficient occasion, there seems more than ever reason to regret that we had not given the <rs>Northern</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> the word more plainly before the blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>They have seen us solicitous to observe a neutrality, the operation of which was unfavorable, even unfair to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>They have seen us foregoing our undoubted right to recognize the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and permitting them to enforce an ineffectual blockade which was most injurious to our interests, and which the law of nations would have warranted us in disregarding; and they have heard us professing a desire for peace above all things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>They remember the patience with which previous insults-have been borne by us, and they take a childish delight in shaking their fists in the face of a great, strong country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>And, accustomed to hear us deprecate, as something to be scarcely thought of, an appeal to arms, the natural consequence is that when they have gone so far as to place themselves in the predicament of having to choose between humiliation and war, they are almost universally persuaded that we shall bear this insult like the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Had our language been different from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>--had we given them plainly to understand that we meant to use our strength on due <unclear></unclear> vocation, even the mob that originates and the <rs>Cabinet</rs> that conveys their vulgar affronts would lower their tone of defiance, and would never have pushed matters to their present extremity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> We have said that in our view, it is to be regretted that the apparent faults of democracy should be so tenderly treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>We are all ready to join in reprobation of absolute government, but when did any civilized and absolute government show less claim on our indulgence than the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic?--What despotism has displayed so little moderation in prosperity, so little dignity in adversity, less <unclear></unclear> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The great achievement in self-government of this vaunted democracy, which we have been so loudly and arrogantly called on to admire, is to drag from his proper obscurity an ex-railspliter and country attorney, and to place what it calls its liberals at his august disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>This anticipation we do not share; on the contrary, we are confident that if they manage in this instance to evade the consequences of the outrage, the proof that we are in earnest will suffice to prevent a repetition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>But the secession of the <rs>South</rs> is not the only nor the greatest peril that threatens the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>There is an <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName> that is hostile to Union; there is a <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> that is hostile to Abolition; and though these discordant elements have hitherto been held together by the common tie of hatred of the <rs>South</rs>, yet they threaten speedily to start asunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Nor will the <rs>North</rs> be split by party conflicts alone; territorial differences are likely to cause further dismemberment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Is it strange, then, that a desperate Cabinet; possessing no influence of talent or character by which to reconcile contending factions, and feeling the planks starting under its feet, should seek, even by such a desperate expedient as a war with a powerful enemy, to keep together the remains of the <rs>Republic</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>On such a theory, the occasion of provoking the war would seem well chosen, as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, in protecting the <rs>Southern Commissioners</rs>, may be made to appear to adopt the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, which it has been the object of the <rs>Federal Cabinet</rs> to accuse her of favoring throughout the struggle; and the new war may thus be rendered popular both with Abolitionists and <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>But we do not attribute to the presumptuous and incapable Ph&#x00E6;cons of the <rs>North</rs> any such deep designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> Whether war comes or not, we think that the opportunity should be taken of our state of preparation to adopt a policy more suitable to our own position and to the interests of the world, than that of bystanders in this cut-throat quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>As it is, our neutrality tells against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We do not impute this to anybody as a fault &mdash; we merely mention it as a fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>And if, by any concurrence of circumstances, (our own interpretation of the duties of neutrals among the rest,) they should reduce the <rs>South</rs> to submission, is it likely that, as victors, the contrivers of the stone fleet will be more generous than they are as foes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>If these questions can receive but <num value="1">one</num> answer, what reason is there that we should longer sacrifice our own interests, and the interests of justice, to an extreme consideration for the morbid irritability of an arrogant people?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> And the <rs>South</rs> as far as can be seen, deserves recognition, independence, and sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Their only crime has been a desire to take no further part in a system to which not even the letter, far less the spirit of the law can prove that they were bound by any principle stronger than convenience, and the operations of which they declare to have been intolerably oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>They have chosen as <rs type="role2">President</rs> a man of judgment and conduct, who can give to their impulses unity of action, and can both excite and control their enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>If the messages of the rival <rs>Presidents</rs> may be considered as indicative of the policy of those who chose the chiefs, or of the causes which they respectively advocate, the <rs>South</rs> are amply justified for regarding with <q>&#x0022;the contemptuous astonishment&#x0022;</q> which <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s language attributes to them, the proceedings of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>They appear to bear their privations with uncommon cheerfulness and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They make no querulous appeals for sympathy, nor complaints of neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>They speak of their successes with modesty, prepare for new distresses with fortitude, and express none of the vindictiveness so prominent in the measures of their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>A war between <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <rs>North</rs> will at least have the good effects of shortening the sufferings and hastening the independence of a people who are proving themselves very capable of self-government, who will at once assume a creditable position among nations, and who will act as a permanent check on Northern turbulence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>And it is to be hoped that, if war is to be, we may put our whole strength and will into it, and conduct it so as to leave the orators and writers of the <rs>North</rs> with all their skill and practice in the falsification of history, no possibility of turning its incidents to our disadvantage, and to their own glorification. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> Here, then, were the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> public, the <rs>Government</rs>, a branch of the <name>Legislature</name>, all approving the act committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Well, with all these facts before our eyes, should we have been justified in supposing that a more courteous application, asking the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government to have the goodness to deliver the <measure n="4" type="captured">four captured</measure> persons into our hands, would have induced them to say, <q>&#x0022;The whole <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people see that we have insulted your flag and are glad of it; but as you ask for the delivery of the prisoners as a favor, as a favor we assent to the delivery!&#x0022;</q> I really think that we should have been deserving of condemnation and censure as short-sighted men, not actively alive to the interests of the country, if we had simply rested our case on the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>(Cheers.)--Moreover, it is well known that it was generally said by persons in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, and also, I believe, by some <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> in this country, that the <measure n="4" type="prisoners">four prisoners</measure> were not to be delivered--<q>&#x0022;that they won't and shan't be given up.&#x0022;</q> What was considered by the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> to be our weak point, and what was the circumstance which made the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> always more difficult to deal with by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> than by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>(Cheers.)--What, then, was it our duty to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>It was to strengthen them, and make the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> see that we are able to defend ourselves in that point which they thought to be the most vulnerable and most easily accessible to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>(Hear, hear.) That was not <q>&#x0022;ferocious gesticulation.&#x0022;</q> (<q>&#x0022;Hear, hear,&#x0022;</q> and laughter.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>(Hear, hear.) Therefore, so far from <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government being obnoxious to blame, I think that the <rs>Government</rs> are deserving of commendation for what they did; and, though they performed no more than their duty, they performed it promptly and efficiently, and have met with, we believe, the approbation of the country at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>(Cheers.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>It was simply a measure which it was our bounden duty to take, seeing the uncertainty of the result of the communications carried out from this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>So far from any feeling of ineradicable irritation between the <num value="2">two</num> countries being engendered by the course pursued, I believe that a contrary course would have produced such a result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>If <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government had submitted to a declared insult, no doubt a vote of censure would have been passed on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Still the act would have been done, and a sense of humiliation and degradation would have been perpetually in the minds of at least the present generation, on account of the gross and unatoned for insult committed against the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>I agree with my honorable friend who has just sat down, that the course actually pursued is <num value="1">one</num> much more likely to produce peace between the <num value="2">two</num> nations.--There start up from time to time between countries antagonistic passions and questions of conflicting interests, which, if not properly dealt with, would terminate in the explosion of war. Now, if <num value="1">one</num> country is led to think that another country, with which such questions might arise, is, from fear, disposed on every occasion tamely to submit to any amount of indignity, that is an encouragement to hostile conduct and to extreme proceedings which lead to conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>It may be depended on that there is no better security for peace between nations than the conviction that each must respect the other, that each is capable of defending itself, and that no insult or injury committed by the <num value="1">one</num> against the other would pass unresented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>(Hear, hear.) Between nations, as between individuals, mutual respect is the best security for mutual good will and mutual courtesy; and therefore, in my opinion, the course pursued by the <rs>Government</rs> is <num value="1">one</num> much more likely than that suggested by my honorable friend the member for <placeName reg="Birmingham, Birmingham, England" key="tgn,7010955">Birmingham</placeName> to secure the continuance of peace.
