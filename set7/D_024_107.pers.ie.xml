<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> During the strategic movements and fighting on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, which have resulted so gloriously for our arms, a large Federal cavalry force, under <persName n="Stoneman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>, made a raid across the <rs>Rapidan</rs> to the line of the <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central Railroad</orgName>, striking it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at <placeName reg="Trevillian's Depot">Trevillian's Depot</placeName>, where, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, the track was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>That was to endeavor to flank our force at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> by crossing above and below it, and contemporaneously to dispatch several bodies of cavalry to get behind our army, destroy its railroad communications with the capital, cut the canal, and even penetrate as far as the <rs type="place">High Bridge</rs>, which was also to be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This plan was changed into a simple direct attack upon our army by order of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The achievements of this bold raid, though in no wise affecting the glorious victory on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, is not without its humiliating reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Talk about abuse of the slave system &mdash; it is not in the power of fiendish human ingenuity to abuse it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>I may be thought to have sins on the other side. [&#x0022;No, no&#x0022;] But more than all, I am hurt in my soul that religion has been corrupted by slavery.
