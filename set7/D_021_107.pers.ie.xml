<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Why, after wards, sooner or later, the troops composing the <rs>French</rs> army which had achieved these brilliant successes, and induced, no doubt, their sin guide compatriots at the other side of the <rs type="place">Channel</rs> to believe that the conquest of pernicious <persName n="Albion,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Albion,nomatch:0"><surname>Albion</surname></persName> was finally achieved, would find their way back to the sea-shore from which they had advanced, and might consider themselves extremely fortunate if enabled to effect an embarkation without interruption at the hands of the conquered foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>That a French army might reduce <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to ashes is within the bounds of possibility, but that a French army, however numerous, could hold in subjection the <rs>British</rs> people, is so utterly impossible that no <num value="1">one</num> has ever yet attempted to demonstrate its possibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Yet, if it were not a contradiction in terms to compare the probabilities of the occurrence of <num value="2">two</num> impossibilities, we would say that the subjugation and occupation of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> by the <rs>French</rs> was infinitely more within the range of possibility than the subjugation and occupation of the <rs>Southern States</rs> by the armies of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>In fact, the supposition of effecting the conquest of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, with their immense extent of territory, compared with which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> seems but a little province, is so utterly absurd, that even at <unclear><dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">Nov.</month></dateStruct> </unclear> <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, in order to make it entertained for a moment, it is necessary by a pleasing fiction to dismiss the idea of any attempt being made to subjugate the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The Northern States, we are continually informed, are not engaged in a war of conquest, they are simply crushing a rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>As soon as a circumscribed number of disaffected persons have been suitably punished, the remainder of the population, disabused of their errors, will, with renewed sentiments of attachment and regard, flock round the banner of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The <rs>Russians</rs>, by the greatest act of self-sacrifice recorded in the history of the world, thus effected the destruction of the most numerous and best appointed army that <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> ever saw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Of late years, the doctrine of election alluded to by the <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi> has prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Before a change of rulers is made, the consent of the governed is obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>But we do not suppose, should an intervention on the basis of election be determined on, such election would be made until the troops on both sides were removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The <hi rend="italics">Examiner's</hi> plan for settling the difficulty is undoubtedly the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>We should concentrate our troops as much as possible, and make a powerful invasion of the enemy's territory.

<head>Can the wound ever be Healed?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> There are some people, only a few we trust, who believe, or affect to believe, that fraternal feeling will again be restored between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>It seems to us that the man must be demential who would entertain the idea, even for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>He that does so has not seen or felt the effects of the war. He has been far removed from the enemy's hostilities, and the wall of the widow, the orphan, and the childless parent, has never been heard in his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>The tears that fell like torrents, after the bloody <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle at Shiloh</rs>, and the cries of distress which still break the silence of desolate homes, will ring through a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Hate, deep, deathless lives with <unclear></unclear> grief and despair; and whether <unclear></unclear> people are free or slaves, they will ever hold in eternal execration the very <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>If the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> make treaty, and our doors are thrown open to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to come and settle with us, or even to trade with us, this Revolution will have been inaugurated in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>In vain the oceans of blood spilled in vain the sufferings and hardships of our brave troops; in vain the loss of time, property and health, in vain all the money expended, and all the untold and unwritten sacrifices and labors of love bestowed upon our bleeding country be the noble women of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>We may be mistaken, but we believe that every day this war <unclear></unclear> digs wider and deeper the gulf between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, which Time, the great Architects as well as Destroyer, can never bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant we may not be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>But if we could be induced to believe that the <rs>South</rs> would ever again restore the laws of trade and intercourse with the <rs>North</rs> or permit the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> to <unclear></unclear> among us and enjoy the rights of citizenship, we would rather make our home in revolutionary <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> or in despotic <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, than dwell in these States with the trell of the serpent around us and over us all. Better that every man, woman and child in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> were dead and resting from life's fitful fever, than live in the chains which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce and <unclear></unclear> would forge for our limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>The wound that has been made is like that between <persName n="Roland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00431" reg="nearbymention:Roland,John,,,"><surname>Roland</surname></persName> and <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Leoline</foreName></persName>, so beautifully and forcibly expressed by <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00432" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName> in his incomparable Christs bell. </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;They stood aloof, the scorn remaining, </l><l>Like cliffs which has been <unclear></unclear> </l><l>A deadly sea now flows between, </l><l>But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder, </l><l>Shall wholly do away, I ween, </l><l>The marks of that which once hath been.&#x0022; </l> </lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> As the separation between us has been final and eternal, let the barriers between us be raised so high and impassable that friendly intercourse shall not be revived, or the morals of the new Republic be contaminated by association with the off-scouring of the old. </p>
