<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>There is no show about him. He means business in every word, look and act. An instance of this plain, business like way of his of doing things occurred a few days since under my immediate observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He came riding along where a brigade was being reviewed by its division officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It was a short time previous to the hour for review, and the men were standing waiting in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>He appeared attended by only a single orderly, whom he immediately dispatched on some message. --While the orderly was absent the <rs>General</rs> rode down the line, but a few feet in advance of it, looking every man in the face as though he would look him through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Nobody seemed to know him, and most supposed him to be some curiosity hunting civilian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Many wondered what that old follow wanted, and some hinted aloud that he must be rather green to be riding down a line of battle in that manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>But the attendant coming back and respectfully reporting to him, he dashed off at a full gallop, and in such a manner as to make it evident that he was not only a military man, but <num value="1">one</num> of some importance withal. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>By the by, I learn that some, more officers than men proportionately, have taken advantage of recent orders and stayed over their time, thus rendering it doubtful whether the order be continued in execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>I hope, however, that the order will not be repeated, but that the delinquents will be made to suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>It substantially gives the control of the militia into the hands of justices of the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>We had private advices yesterday that the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> were going on with the form of a legislative session, and, quorum or no quorum, would press the bill to its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> As was predicted by many, and constantly kept before our military authorities by the local press, it has turned out that the enemy have erected batteries on the lower end of the levee, some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> below where the fleet is anchored and a little above the point where the mortar boats lay sheltered behind the timber last summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Operations on this work had been observed for a week or more, and the prevailing opinion was that batteries were being erected on the levee &mdash; as affording the only ground for which they could get within range of the city. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>As soon as the atmosphere became sufficiently clear on Wednesday to get a good view, the enemy's guns opened on the lower part of the city, aiming, no doubt, at <num value="1">one</num> of our guns located in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>About <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot was fired, and at short intervals the firing was continued till night.

<head>Progress of the <name>Naval</name> profession.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> The changes which have occurred in naval warfare are as radical and remarkable as those in military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The ships, the discipline, the armament, the officers, have all been the subjects of prodigious revolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>If any object attached to a ship has undergone little transformation it is the common sailor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The introduction of steam may after his character also; but at present, and until the steam vessels outnumber the sailing vessels of the world, he remains the same generous heroic, hard-working, good-for-nothing, ignorant, reverential, and profane vagabond that he has been from the existence of navigation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> To those familiar with the special professional qualifications required in naval officers of the present day, it seems almost incredible that <persName n="Blake,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="mostcommon:Blake,nomatch:0"><surname>Blake</surname></persName>, who swept the flags of <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,2068373" n="1.000 1" reg="castile, wyoming, new york">Castile</placeName> from the ocean, was not educated a sailor, but a soldier; that the dashing cavalry leader, <persName><foreName>Rupert</foreName></persName>, and the famous General, <persName n="Monk,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Monk,nomatch:0"><surname>Monk</surname></persName>, were put in command of large fleets; and even the marine defence of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> against the <rs>Spanish</rs> armada was entrusted to a man who was not a sailor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Imagine the sensation which would be produced at the present day by such an order as this from a commander who wished to put his ship about--&#x0022; <hi rend="italics">wheel to the left!</hi>&#x0022; Yet such an order was actually given by <persName n="Monk,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Monk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Monk</surname></persName>, though the historian who records the incident adds that he &#x0022; <hi rend="italics">moved the mirth of his crew.</hi>&#x0022; Of course he did. For though the &#x0022;quarter-deck&#x0022; might make itself a laughing stock by its ignorance, &#x0022;forward of the mainmast&#x0022; was expected to know <persName n="Neptune,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="mostcommon:Neptune,nomatch:0"><surname>Neptune</surname></persName> like a brother, to adapt itself to his caprices, to struggle with him when refractory, and, whether in storm or calm to carry the &#x0022;meteor flag&#x0022; of Britain victorious over the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>And this <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName> generally did with, an expertness and a vim which left it immaterial whether the epaulette were worn by a monk or a monkey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>All that he required was to be permitted to work the ship according to the usual custom of men-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>But even this was not always permitted, and many a noble ship, manned by veterans who had been cradled upon the deep, was sent to the bottom by the obstinacy of some soldier captain, who insisted upon the actual as well as nominal direction of his vessel, instead of permitting that practical seaman, the master, to control the navigation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> Even the <rs>French</rs>, who are supposed to be theoretically, not less than practically, inferior to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in seamanship, were before her and every other nation in educating young men specially for the sea service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Not until <dateStruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></dateStruct>, when <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> discovered that a General was not more fitted to command a fleet than a commands a brigade, had any nation, ancient or modern, drawn a line of complete separation between the military and naval professions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The great <rs type="role" reg="Commander">Commanders</rs> of ancient times were amphibious warriors &mdash; alligators and hippopotamus &mdash; who were equally fitted for fighting by land and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>But vessels of war, in the days of <persName n="Cimon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Cimon,nomatch:0"><surname>Cimon</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lysander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Lysander,nomatch:0"><surname>Lysander</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Pompey</foreName></persName> and Ayripps, required little nautical science for their management, and could be directed by any amphibious animal of ordinary intelligence without difficulty.--They fought, in part, on the <hi rend="italics">butting</hi> principle, like the river rams of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> warfare, which are sometimes commanded by civil engineers, and not unfrequently captured by <rs type="role" reg="Colonel">Colonels</rs> of cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> Emollet's life-like pictures of <persName n="Bowling,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Bowling,nomatch:0"><surname>Bowling</surname></persName> and Traunton describe the genuine old sea-dogs who were mingled with the military and loafer commanders of an era in which &#x0022;the seamen of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were not gentlemen, and the gentlemen were not seamen&#x0022; Sturdier sailors and warriors the world never saw, but they went black guarding and cursing over the face of the great deep, and walloping their crews with such inexhaustible and pertinacious energy, that every ship of-war of that period was a hell afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>On shore they were as helpless as so many fishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>They sometimes undertook to ride on horseback, and directed their unfortunate steeds according to the most approved principles of navigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>They were always &#x0022;talking ropes&#x0022; and astonishing the natives by the profusion and vigor of their maritime vernacular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But the venerable Walrus was gradually superceded by a very superior class of beings, until at last it might be said, as the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of <name>British</name> naval commanders, and of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> afterwards as well, that they were both seamen and gentlemen, and that their professional knowledge was as scientific as practical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>It is difficult to realize that perhaps the most refined and unassuming stranger whom you chance to meet in the coffee house of a Confederate seaport, <num value="1">one</num> who has no <sic>psenliarities</sic> to indicate his profession, or provincialisms of his native section, and who, when off duty, rigidly eschews &#x0022;the buttons,&#x0022; is the representative in our service of the seahorse and blowhards of <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> ago. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> thinks that the substance of the <name>Conscription</name> bill passed by the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>This sweeping conscription act is designed to meet the contingency of foreign intervention, and in view of a powerful military diversion into <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> or <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Let us have a single telling victory upon the heels of there comprehensive war measures and they will be sufficient to convince even <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> that <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> is tottering to his fall, and that <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention is utterly out of the question. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Let him argue a few <num value="1000000">millions</num> more of legal tenders <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>But to achieve anything of real importance we must have military and naval successes.
