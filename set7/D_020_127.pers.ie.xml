<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It is fit for the latitude of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and for no other latitude as far as we know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It is eminently <hi rend="italics">sinful</hi> for a proud, high-spirited race of gentlemen slaveholders, like the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> We proceed to indicate some of the most objectionable points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, Universal Suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>This is the most formidable instrument that tyranny ever employed to enslave a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It was by methods analogous to it that <persName n="Tiberius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Tiberius,nomatch:0"><surname>Tiberius</surname></persName>, the most crafty tyrant that ever existed, succeeded in crushing the better classes in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, and in treading out the last spark of liberty that had been left unextinguished by his predecessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>It is by this means that <persName><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>has become the sole ruler of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>But for the strongest proof of its effects, let us look across the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>A year ago, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation boasted that it was the freest in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Now, it crouches <unclear></unclear> feet of a despotism stronger than that of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, more debasing than that of <placeName key="tgn,1000160" n="1.000 1" reg="benin">Dahomey</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>And this is the effect of Universal Suffrage.--My country came <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be ruled by a mob, and the mob chose a master who ruled them with a <unclear></unclear> Their example affords a warning <unclear></unclear> all time against Universal Suffrage.-- <unclear></unclear> has failed, and it never will fall, to <unclear></unclear>despotism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> Next let us get rid of the system of electing every petty officer by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>This is <unclear></unclear> part of the system which leads to <unclear>des</unclear> The people become wearied with the <unclear>ever sting</unclear> succession of elections, and at last <unclear></unclear> to attend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The consequence is, that a few <unclear></unclear> demagogues confer an the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The officers become nuisances under the control of <unclear></unclear> into whose hands they fall, the system of election becomes a burden, and the people, fatigued and worried, are ready to give up the <unclear>ise,</unclear> on condition of being relieved from the trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>It operates badly in other reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The men who obtain offices are not, general, of a class to deserve them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Hence defalcation, corruption, neglect of duty, and all the evils that flow from mob government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Every man in the <rs>State</rs> is conversant with the extreme difficulty of collecting the full revenue of the counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The <rs>Sheriff</rs> is elected by the people &mdash; he goes around to collect the <unclear></unclear> is put off by almost every man he meets, and, unless he be a person of strong moral courage, he dare not put the law in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>inst he lose, in every instance, a vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The vices arising from this state of things are deplorable, are palpable, are almost universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>New are they less felt in other particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The darks of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> were, under the also Constitution of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the most remarkable body of public officers that ever existed.--They were gentlemen of high intelligence generally sound lawyers, and thoroughly accommodated in their vocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>When the old system was changed, it was found that there had been but <num value="1">one</num> defalcation among the whole body of them from the time of the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>We fail the contrast now, when a demagogue who <unclear></unclear> dot know how to write his name may such a fair chance, indeed <hi rend="italics">does</hi> stand the fairest chance of all others, of being elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Has no man had occasion to observe how touch vote lenient the judges and justices now are the they formerly were to delinquents?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>And, heaven knows, they were always too lenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>What is the cause?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Why, is it now <unclear></unclear> unpossible to convict a criminal upon the clearest evidence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>It is because the criminal has a vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>We make no particular allusion, not do we believe that more than a very few of their officers would be swayed by such <unclear></unclear> native, if they were conscious of it to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/><unclear></unclear> human nature is weak, and interest is <unclear></unclear> too apt to have its effect in blessing the <unclear>ment</unclear> of the best of us. Let us go back to the old <name>English</name> rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Let the judge be <unclear></unclear> the ermine placed above suspicion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> In the third place, let us have no more <hi rend="italics">paid</hi> justices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Any man who remembers the old benefit of justices in any county, and will compare <unclear></unclear> its successor of the present day, will be sticking by the contrast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Formerly, men of intelligence and standing filled the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Their decisions were received with respect, and we have high authority for saying fewer of them were reversed by the <orgName n="Appeals Court" type="court">Court of Appeals</orgName> than those were of the <rs type="place">Superior Courts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>We will not stop to point out the great change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>And what is the cause of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The justices are elected by the people &mdash; the people vote for the most popular man, for his popular qualities &mdash; the miserable pittance attached to the office attracts every loafer and drone who is too lazy to earn a livelihood in any other way, and such persons are but too apt to succeed through demagogue arts, over the best men of a county. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> There are other points to which we would allude, had we not already made this article too long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>But they will be easily understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Let us exorcise the foul spirit of Yankeeism from our institutions; let us go back, as near as we can, to the old Constitution of <persName n="Mason,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="default:Mason,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, or whoever drew up the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>--the most perfect form of government the world ever saw.

From that day to this every step in advance has been a plunge in the mire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>If there are any members with weak knees, we assure them they have nothing to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The people are for the change, and the demagogues they leave behind them when they come here cannot hurt them. </p> </div3>
