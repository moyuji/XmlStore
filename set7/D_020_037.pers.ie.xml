<head><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <rs>North</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The reported determination of the <rs>English Admiral</rs> off the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> coast to break the blockade is giving special uneasiness, as well it may, in those Northern cities which have sought to take away our liberties for the benefit of their commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>That such an interposition by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will take place, sooner or later, is what they feel to their heart's core.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The extraordinary exasperation manifested towards <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> by the <rs>Northern</rs> press finds its solution, not in anything she has done, but in what with good reason, they apprehend she will do. In declaring her perfect neutrality between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, and even in acknowledging the <rs>South</rs> as a belligerent, whilst, as yet, she has accorded us in relation to prizes taken by our privateers, none of the rights of a belligerent nation, she has given no just cause for that outburst of indignation which has issued from the whole Northern press. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The real motive of all this outcry is that the shrewd, commercial mind of the <rs>North</rs> not only recognizes in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> its real rival, but is aware that her manufacturing and commercial necessities render it indispensable that her supply of cotton should not be interrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>She now has on hand, we believe, enough for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> only, and it is not likely she will wait till that short period has expired before she provides for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Cotton she must have &mdash; that the <rs>North</rs> understands as well as the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Hitherto the <rs>North</rs> has endeavored to delude <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with the idea that cotton would be forwarded from the <rs>South</rs> by railroad to the <rs>Northern</rs> ports, and then, when this game was blocked by the determination of the people and the law of Congress not to permit a bale to leave the country in that manner, they swore they would come and take it But that was an oath more easily taken than fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They have not yet got tobacco country, and the cotton region is more distant still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Even if they could seize the <rs>Southern</rs> seaports and centres of the cotton trade, the coveted prey would not be there, for the cotton factors have requested the planters not to send it from their plantations, the underwriters refuse to insure it in transits, and the planters themselves are keeping it at home, and will rather burn it than permit it to fall into the enemy's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These facts cannot be without their influence abroad, and it is a through conviction of their truth that makes the <rs>Northern</rs> press so irritable, and even belligerent, towards <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The influence of the great <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, in this point of view, cannot be overestimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was all important to the <rs>North</rs>, in more respects than <num value="1">one</num>, that the war should be <q>&#x0022;short and sharp.&#x0022;</q> <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> in their hands by the <date value="07- 20">20th of July,</date> and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would have assurance that the rebellion would be put down, and that she would get her cotton supply in time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> The question between the <name>South</name> and <name>North</name> does not admit of compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>With the <rs>South</rs> it is a resalute and unalterable determination to be no longer associated with such a people as the <rs>Northern</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>With the <rs>North</rs> it is an arrogant determination to prevent the separation of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> mods of settling the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The South cannot recedes or compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>She will have independence, not only because it is hor right and her interest to possess it, but because a state of dependence would be intolerable, and longer union with the <rs>North</rs> would be interpreted into, and would in fact be, nothing but dependence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Besides, the <rs>South</rs> is able to achieve her independence, and make good her case in this war. The <rs>North</rs> cannot succeed in accomplishing its purposes; and the <rs>South</rs>, by consenting to any mediation or compromise that does not grant absolute separation, would voluntarily relinquish a result which she has perfectly within her command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> True, it is for the interest of both parties that the war should cease; but it is not for the interest of the <rs>South</rs> that the intercourse and amenities of friendly nations should be instituted between the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>If there were a great gulf fixed between the <num value="2">two</num> peoples, impassable as that which separated <persName n="Dives,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Dives,nomatch:0"><surname>Dives</surname></persName> from <persName n="Lazarus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Lazarus,nomatch:0"><surname>Lazarus</surname></persName>, the <rs>South</rs> would soon become the most prosperous and <num value="1">one</num> of the most powerful nations on the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The contiguity of the <rs>North</rs> will ever exert a baneful influence upon all her interests &mdash; social, political, commercial and moral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>If to this should be added free friendly intercourse, the &#x0022;universal nation&#x0022; would come down upon her like the locusts of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, eating up every green thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>They would infest our high places and low, and be ever ready to betray and barter away our interests in peace, and our cause in war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> The experiment of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> institutions is lost at the <rs>North</rs>, and it can only be saved at the <rs>South</rs> by maintaining as strict a nonintercourse with the moral Seldom and political Pandemonium on our borders, as the nature of the case will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>We are willing to agree to the cessation of hostilities; but if any foreign mediation shall exact concessions of intercourse, and commercial and political privilege, as a bargain and stipulation, it will exact what cannot be granted without destruction to our social, political, and commercial integrity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> The case, therefore, is not <num value="1">one</num> for arbitration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The South cannot refer so grave a question as that of her independence to any arbitration, much less to that of a foreign potentate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Did ever <num value="2">two</num> litigants refer to arbitration the question of either <num value="1">one</num>'s slavery?--Independence is a question that cannot be referred by the <rs>South</rs>; and that is, in fact, the only question really involved in the present contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>The cavalry companies marched in front, with the infantry behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Just here I will state that an efficient fortification had been thrown across the main street by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but the guns had all been removed.
