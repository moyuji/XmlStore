<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It must be settled by the arbitrament of the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Words are now of no avail: blood is more potent than rhetoric, more profound than logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But it is, nevertheless, interesting to know on what side these religious dignitaries are arrayed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He reasons it very ably, presenting in strong light the injuries inflicted on the <rs>South</rs>, her concessions, the failure of all efforts at redress, and the consummation of Northern tyranny in the sectional triumph by the election of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> on the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He refers to the commercial interests of the <rs>North</rs>, the vast productive power of the <rs>South</rs>, and portrays the immense injury the <rs>North</rs> must sustain in the separation it has forced upon the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He displays his abiding confidence in the power of the <rs>South</rs> to sustain herself, and shows that the <rs>North</rs> must be the greatest sufferer by the war. The South, he contends, has resources in men and means to carry on a long war more successfully than the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In provisions, he is satisfied there will be enough gathered in the crops of the present year for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Clothing, though of rude texture, is abundantly made, he says; and there are some <measure n="25000000dollars" type="currency">$25,000,000</measure> of specie in the <rs>South</rs> as the basis of that paper medium, which will readily answer our purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The Government will have, he contends, <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> of bales of cotton the spinal column of our financial system) as a basis for its credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>If exported at once, they will be as good as gold for <measure n="100000000dollars" type="currency">$100,000,000</measure>; and, if not so exported, a security undoubted for that amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The blockade, he reasons, has been beneficial to the <rs>South</rs>, as it has forced her to manufacture a great many things she has heretofore gotten entirely from the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Upon this reasoning, he assumes that the <rs>South</rs> must triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He concludes: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> &#x0022;The separation of the <rs>Southern States</rs> is <hi rend="italics">un fait accompli.</hi> The Federal Government has no power to reverse it. Sooner or later it must be recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Why preface the recognition by a war equally needless and bloody?

He declares that he was a friend of peace until the war began, but does not now dare to hope for peace until he can see some solid ground upon which to establish it. He reasons that the <rs>South</rs> begun the war &mdash; that it had no right to secede or separate, no matter what its complaints, except in the mode provided by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The election of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> </hi> was not sufficient ground, he contends, since so many Southern <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> had filled the <name>Presidential</name> chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He denies the right of secession in a State more than a county or a town from a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>(He seems to have been a pupil of the profound <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.</hi>) In short, he is an out-and-out Federalist &mdash; is against the cry of peace &mdash; for the vigorous prosecution of war; but declares that the <rs>North</rs> is not fighting for subjugation, but to bring back the seceded States to their organic condition before the war. The only peace suggestion that he thinks practicable at the present moment is the holding, during the progress of hostilities, of <num value="2">two</num> conventions--<num value="1">one</num> in the seceded States, and the other in the loyal States--where, in the former, a statement of grievances and reclamations might be prepared, and in the latter a reconsideration of the points in which the <rs>Constitution</rs> may have proved inadequate to meet the present difficulties, the whole to be submitted to a <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">convention of delegates</orgName> from all the <name>States</name> as soon as a common agreement can be effected for that purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Thus much for the controversy between the <name>Bishops</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is marked by much ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <rs>Archbishop</rs> adds ingenuity to his essay, in the employment of which he is not over-scrupulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>For instance, he quotes from <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName></hi> the remark of some Southern men hostile to foreigners as an illustration of Southern feeling towards them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He confesses that the gentleman quoted by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName></hi> is no true representative of the gentlemen it was his fortune to meet in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><q>&#x0022;But no matter,&#x0022;</q> he says, <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;if it be true, it shews that for <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and foreigners in general the <rs>South</rs> is nearly as unfriendly as the <rs>North</rs> can be.&#x0022;</q><bibl n="Mr. Russell"></bibl></cit>-- He has not the hardihood, even if it be true, to say that the <rs>South</rs> is <hi rend="italics">as</hi> <q>&#x0022;unfriendly&#x0022;</q> as the <rs>North</rs>; for he could not ignore the fact that the <rs>South</rs> has protected foreigners, while the <rs>North</rs> has mobbed them, <unclear><hi rend="italics">burnt their churches,</hi></unclear> sought their disfranchisement, and even invaded the property and authority of the <rs>Bishop</rs> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But, nevertheless, he chooses to give the <rs>North</rs> what advantage he can by quoting <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s</hi> anecdote, and saying <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;if it be true,&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl></cit>&#x0026;c., knowing that with his admirers it will have the same effect as if it were true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This is the meanest act we ever knew of the <rs>Archbishop</rs>, and shows what men, with some reputation, for fairness, may descend to in maintaining a bad cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> It is passing strange that a learned and ardent Irishman like the <rs>Archbishop</rs>, who desires the separation of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, should throw his influence in behalf of the coercion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people to an alliance with those whom they loathe, and the sovereign Southern States into a union to which they will never submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It may, in a measure, be accounted for by the fact that the <name>Arch</name> bishop is an intimate friend of the <hi rend="italics">arch-fiend</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.</hi> It is not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the route of the <q>&#x0022;devil's walk&#x0022;</q> was through a <rs type="role2">Bishop</rs>'s palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Again, whatever be the <rs>Archbishop</rs>'s motive, it is certain that after his coercion letter, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Erastus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Erastus,nomatch:0"><surname>Erastus</surname></persName>.</hi> (ye rascal) <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Brooks,nomatch:0"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName></hi> would hardly attack his prerogative and property, in the <orgName n="New York Senate" type="senate">New York <hi rend="smallcaps">Senate</hi></orgName>; and there can be no doubt that the <rs>Archbishop</rs> feels, now that he has espoused the <rs>Northern</rs> tyranny, vastly more secure than when a few years since appealing to the public against the persecution of that <hi rend="italics">Know-Nothing wolf.</hi> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The armies of <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName> and the wealth of <persName><foreName>Solomon</foreName></persName> would hardly sustain a comparison with the hosts of men and mountains of money which &mdash; at any rate, upon paper &mdash; are placed at the command of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for the suppression of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.--We may venture, perhaps, to pass without too rigorous a scrutiny the bold, though some what gasconading, vote by which the intelligence of the defeat at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was received in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The <num value="1000000">millions</num> so precipitately offered represented, probably, the patriotic resolution of the <rs>North</rs> to spend its last dollar in the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>; but, without pressing these loose figures to their literal import, we are really astounded at the conclusions which are forced upon us by recent reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It used to be thought that this country had attained an unhappy but unapproachable eminence in national indebtedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Half our entire expenditure in ordinary years goes still to pay the interest of borrowed money, and when we were told to look at <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> and observe how, under democratic institutions, a country as populous as our own could be governed at <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of the expense, we could not but feel the force of the contrast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/><hi rend="italics">We knew, indeed, that <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> had all her temptations to come, and it was occasionally remarked in these columns that the tendency to extravagance on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs></hi> was rapidly increasing, but the comparison still remained a striking <num value="1">one</num>.--Now, however, a critical test has been applied, America is involved in war, and the rate at which she is raising men and money will, if carefully examined, appear almost too extraordinary for belief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> The exact position of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> finances must be to a great extent a matter of estimate even in the country itself; but it has been calculated, on good authority, that the actual expenditure of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> at the present moment is at the rate of about &#x00A3;<num value="75000000">75,000,000</num> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>This, it is true, is less by &#x00A3;<num value="9000000">9,000,000</num> than the amount of our own expenditure--&#x00A3;<num value="84000000">84,000,000</num>--in the heaviest year of the <name>Crimean</name> war; but <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of that charge was absorbed, in providing for the interest of the national debt, and the whole sum only showed an excess of some &#x00A3;<num value="35000000">35,000,000</num> over our ordinary place expenditure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>In <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct> we spent &#x00A3;<num value="51000000">51,000,000</num>; in <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct>, &#x00A3;<num value="60000000">60,000,000</num>; and it was not until we found ourselves in the very agony of the struggle that we added some <num value="0.6">sixty per cent</num> to our usual outlay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We may say, in short, that the war cost us for the <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> when it was most expensive about &#x00A3;<num value="30000000">30,000,000</num> of money, whereas the civil war is costing the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> at its very outset at least twice that sum. An expenditure of &#x00A3;<num value="75000000">75,000,000</num> represents an excess of about &#x00A3;<num value="60000000">60,000,000</num>, on the ordinary outlay of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and this incurred, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaign has just been opened, and before the real proportions of the war can be supposed to be developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>This, however, though a most ominous fact, constitutes by no means the most striking feature of the case before us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> When we, in this country, were spending these tens of <num value="1000000">millions</num> upon the war in hand, we were also taxing ourselves in proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>We met on outlay of &#x00A3;<num value="84000000">84,000,000</num> by taxes to the amount of &#x00A3;<num value="63000000">63,000,000</num> not, actually paid into the <name>Exchequer</name> after the costs of collection had been deducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>In the following year we provided no less than &#x00A3;<num value="68000000">68,000,000</num> to meet an aggregate charge of &#x00A3;<num value="78000000">78,000,000</num>, so that in the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> together we added only some &#x00A3;<num value="30000000">30,000,000</num> to the national debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>In fact, the whole war, sanguinary and exhausting as it proved, only augmented the public debt by the sum of &#x00A3;<num value="32793000">32,793,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Let us now contrast these statistics with the accounts received from <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The ordinary Federal revenue amounts to about &#x00A3;<num value="16000000">16,000,000</num>, so that the extraordinary charge of the war, to be met either by taxation or loan, is, as we have said, about &#x00A3;<num value="60000000">60,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>But how do the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> propose to raise this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>What proportion will they borrow, and what proportion will they levy by taxation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>As far as we can collect from the figures transmitted, they design to borrow the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>They have voted fresh taxes, undoubtedly; but these taxes, we imagine, will do little more than provide for the mere interest of the debts contracted, or, as it is phrased, serve as <q>&#x0022;a basis for loans.&#x0022;</q> We arrive at this conclusion party by arithmetical calculation, and partly from intimations conveyed by the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> journals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> We are told distinctly that, though Congress was ready to authorize any amount of loans it hesitated when asked for supplies on which to base them; and we observe that, though the best affected of the New York bankers did at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suggest that provision should be made for meeting part of the principal, they presently admitted that this arrangement might be dispensed with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Moreover, it seems pretty evident that the produce, of the new taxes will not suffice for much more than the liquidation of the enormous interest, which, as we shall presently remark, will be incessantly accruing, Until we get the estimates of the <rs>Government</rs> placed before us we can do little more than approximate to the truth by conjecture and computation; but, if the <rs>Federal</rs> revenue were to be doubled by the proceeds of fresh taxation, the increase of income would be almost all absorbed in paying the interest of the debt which will probably be contracted by this time twelvemonth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>In other words, the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> are now creating a national debt at the rate of &#x00A3;<num value="60000000">60,000,000</num> a year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> We entreat the reader to observe for a moment what this implies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Such a course throws all our borrowing into the shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>In all the <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war, from <dateStruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></dateStruct>, we only borrowed &#x00A3;<num value="104000000">104,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>In the <measure n="22years" type="date">twenty-two years</measure> of the great Revolutionary war we averaged less than &#x00A3;<num value="30000000">30,000,000</num> a year, and in the tremendous year <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">14</year></dateStruct> the loan was but &#x00A3;<num value="36000000">36,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But this is but only half the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The burthen of a loan depends not so much on the amount of principal as on the rate of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>We borrowed our money even in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct> at a little above <num value="0.045">four and a half per cent.</num>, and in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> at a little above <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> The <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, however, began by an offer of <num value="0.07">seven per cent.</num>, and are at this moment compelled to pay <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="0.12">twelve per cent.</num> We find, therefore, that while &#x00A3;<num value="60000000">60,000,000</num> annually would be added to their national debt, &#x00A3;<num value="6000000">6,000,000</num> annually would be added to the charge of that debt, so that <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> and <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of their present expenditure would saddle them with a burthen equal to that which we have incurred in a century and <num value="0.5">a half</num>. <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName> has to provide some &#x00A3;<num value="28000000">28,000,000</num> to satisfy the public creditors of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>, if the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war should be protracted so long, <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>'s successor will have to provide rather more than that sum for the creditors of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> It is obvious to remark that the war may not be carried on so long, or continued at so heavy a cost; and, indeed, the exorbitant propositions of Congress were probably based upon the assumption that the way to make short work was to go to work unsparingly at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>But the history of the campaign up to the present point contains little to suggest a speedy termination of the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The Southerners are not likely to succumb, nor the <name>Northerners</name> to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Neither is it at all in accordance with experience in these matters that the cost of a war should be diminished as it goes on. The scale of operations, indeed, as far as resolutions go, has been actually extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The last mail tells us that the volunteer bills passed by Congress empower the <rs>President</rs> to call <num value="1000000">one million</num> men into the field, and it was supposed that half those numbers would be actually raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had not a larger army when he crossed the <name>Nicmen</name> with the most prodigious best ever seen in modern days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>We can detect no sign, therefore, of any curtailment in the dimensions of this extraordinary war, though we may well doubt whether the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> will find themselves able to borrow quite so fast as they desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>They have evidently the will to rival the most reckless of States in this ruinous race, but they may not have the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Their credit is already but indifferent, and the terms of the market are sure to become less and less favorable as loan follows loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>This, however, is the only difficulty likely to operate as a check to their career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The desire for a compromise, already discernable in the classes on whom the expenses of the war will fall, would be ineffective in comparison with the passions of the multitude exempted from taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We see, in short, democracy in a crisis which brings all its various pretensions to trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Its institutions are certainly not calculated to make men pacific, or this unnatural war would never have been adopted and prosecuted as it, has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>As certainly have they no tendency to promote public economy, for the expenditure of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> is beyond all example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We shall now be able to note their operation on popular opinion, and observe how taxes are regulated and obligations incurred a great national struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The commencement, however, says little for a system which has been so loudly extolled as superior to all others. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Besides, from all I can learn, no man hereabouts has spent as much time or labored half as hard for the cause of the <rs>South</rs> since the beginning of the present difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> --The <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> appears this morning in a new dress, which may not look as well to-day as it will in a day or <num value="2">two</num>, when the additional press we have put up becomes more pliant and smooth in its working.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The ancient garments of the paper have, we know, occasioned serious complaints among our readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We did what was in our power to avoid the inevitable consequence of worn type and a large circulation &mdash; viz; indifferent printing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We have introduced the new type as soon as we could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Our types wear out amazingly fast now. The daily edition is more than twice as great as it was a year ago, having reached <num value="26000">26,000</num>, while the weekly is <num value="10000">10,000</num> and the semi-weekly <num value="6000">6,000</num>. <num value="1">One</num> day wears the type nearly as much as <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> did this time last year, and consequently we use up <num value="3">three</num> times as much type as we did then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Our readers will thus see the extreme difficulty of keeping the paper dressed up as it should be. It is as easy with a small circulation to print well as it is for a volunteer to keep his uniform clean in time of peace for street parades, but as difficult with an excessively large circulation, as for the said volunteer to keep his uniform clean in active service in time of war. We shall continue our exertions, however, to avoid what, should it occasionally happen, our readers may make due allowance for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> While we return our thanks to the public at large for the unprecedented liberality with which our paper has been supported, we feel assured that it has been due, in a great degree, to the general confidence in our zeal for, and fidelity to, the cause in which the <rs>South</rs> is enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment when the issue was presented the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> has never hesitated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It assumed the flag of separation and has never borne any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>It took up the cause when beset with doubt and division at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It has lived to see those <unclear></unclear> and divisions dispersed &mdash; to behold the <rs>South</rs> united &mdash; and the dawn of a glorious future breaking upon the great <rs>Southern Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>If for this our success has been great, it would be an imputation upon the judgment of our friends, of which we certainly shall not be guilty; to say that it is without merit!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It is unnecessary to add that we shall continue to adhere to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, since it is hardly possible any would suppose that we would desert the ship in sight of port, after having clung to it through a perilous voyage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> We shall endeavor to improve the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> as much as possible as a newspaper, and to make it more and more worthy of confidence and encouragement. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>To the people of the <rs>Southern Republic</rs> such language was scarcely intelligible, for the simple reason that no <num value="1">one</num> here had entertained from the moment of secession the most remote idea of such a possibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It was difficult, therefore, to understand why it required a grand battle like that of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> to open the eyes of the foreign public to a fact so evident to ourselves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> The solemn earnestness, the clear and irrevocable purpose of the <rs>South</rs> must be thoroughly understood abroad before we can expect recognition by <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>All the vessels taken are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> libelled, then confiscated, and will be finally sold to the highest bidder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Some of these vessels were loading with cargoes for foreign ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The Government, it is stated, will not claim their cargoes, (unless it should be proved they were intended to be shipped to Southern ports,) and the owners will be afforded every facility for their removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/> In case of most of the seizures but a small part &mdash; say <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the vessel &mdash; belongs to parties in the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>The <num value="3">three</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> owners, resident in the <rs>North</rs>, will bid in the vessels, and, as the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> has discretionary powers by the act, he will, undoubtedly, remit the amount paid for shares previously owned by the bidders-in, and accept only the amount due for the portion of the vessel claimed by Southern owners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/> The Southern owners can, of course, have no claim upon the <rs>Northern</rs> buyers, as the act of Congress confiscates their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The South is thus likely to be cut off from any ownership in a large number of vessels, and Northern shipowners will have an opportunity of adding to their property at a considerable rate, considering the probable amount which will be invested under the confiscation sale. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> With regard to the transferred vessels, it is believed that there will be no special difficulty in establishing the illegality of the transfers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The Federal Government will not be likely to recognize powers of attorney issued by the rebels &mdash; particularly when they were issued for the purpose of attempting to nullify a law enacted by Congress, and to avoid the confiscation which the act of Congress and the proclamation of the <rs>President</rs> decree. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Post"></bibl></cit> </div3>
