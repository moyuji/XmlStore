<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> My proclamation, issued on the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> day, of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, states succinctly the considerations which induced me to convene you in extraordinary session. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Duty, however, requires of me a more detailed exposition of my views upon the subjects therein referred to, as well as the presentation of such recommendations as are demanded by a proper regard for the public interests, and the faithful, prompt and efficient execution of the laws of this great and growing Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These views and recommendations will be presented with as much brevity as the extraordinary circumstances of the times will justify. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Entertaining a profound respect for the intelligence, experience and information of the gentlemen constituting the <num value="2">two</num> houses of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>, I feel that it would be a reflection upon them to accompany each recommendation with an assignment of all the reasons which might be urged in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I will content myself, therefore, with the assignment of a few general reasons in support of my recommendations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>You will consider and discuss them, and either adopt or reject them, as your judgment and discretion shall determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I am responsible to the people, our common constituents, for the recommendations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>You are responsible to the same tribunal for the disposition you may make of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> I regret that I cannot congratulate you on the peace and prosperity, the healthy and flourishing condition of the various branches of business in which our people are so vitally interested, and offer bright and cheering hopes for the future of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The times are indeed full of peril and danger, and demand from those who are clothed with representative trusts, coolness, calmness and firmness, united with prudence, wisdom, moderation and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Indecision or indiscretion, passion or prejudice, heedlessness or recklessness, will precipitate results that may be deplored, when too late to be averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A blunder at such a time is a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>An error committed now can never perhaps be corrected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> With these preliminary remarks, I address myself to the discussion of the most important question that has ever claimed your consideration, and in the determination of which so much of human happiness or misery is involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I repeat, as applicable to this occasion, the language of <persName n="Floyd,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, in his message of <date value="1833-01">January, 1833:</date> &#x0022;Your station is high and responsible; to you the people will look; nay, do look for security and protection and the maintenance of all the rights of the <name>States</name>.

<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Federal relations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The condition of our country at this time excites the most serious fears for the perpetuation of the <rs>Union</rs>. &#x0022;Clouds overlapping clouds, are weaving o'er our house an evil roof, a fearful canopy.&#x0022; The country is torn by dissension; fierce and angry excitement exhibits itself in all sections; passion and prejudice have taken absolute possession of the minds of the people throughout the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The vile spirit of faction, &#x0022;which pollutes the fountain of national honor, and digs the grave of patriotism,&#x0022; shows itself on all sides.--Confidence is destroyed; fraternal feeling has been supplanted by intense sectional hate; the spirit of conciliation has been smothered and crushed, and the affections of the people <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, appear to have been entirely withdrawn from their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The ties of brotherhood have been severed; and though living under the same Constitution, the sections seem to be as hostile, each to the other, as if their citizens belonged to unfriendly governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Distrust has marred the pleasure of friendship and social intercourse; bitterness and unkindness have crushed out fraternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Unity of feeling, unity of action is now gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is hardly possible for a government to live and flourish under such adverse circumstances.--&#x0022;We must not, however, look mournfully into the past. &#x0022; That is beyond the hope of recall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We must wisely improve the present; correct its errors; reform its abuses; reunite the severed ties of affection, and enkindle a new the fires of patriotism, if we would recover all that has been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It this shall be done, a bright and glorious future is yet before us. We should be blessed with power, influence, wealth and prosperity, such as no nation has ever enjoyed in the history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Great as has been our success, as compared with the nations of the earth, heretofore, greater far would it be hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> It is interesting to trace our progress, from the formation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> up to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The results will be found in the highest degree gratifying to our pride as a people, and immensely important, so far as our power and influence as a nation is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>What was the area of our country in square miles, embraced by the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> States!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Only <num value="549615">549,615</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>What is it now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><num value="33">Thirty-three</num> States, covering an area of <num value="1602000">1,602,000</num>, <num value="6">six</num> organized Territories, exclusive of the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, covering an area of <num value="1401000">1,401,000</num>; and in addition, we have the <rs type="place">Mesilla Valley</rs>, embracing <num value="78000">78,000</num>, and the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> territory, embracing <num value="187000">187,000</num> square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Our territory has been enlarged nearly <num value="7">seven</num> times in extent; our navy has been increased until its canvas whitens every ocean, and our national flag assures protection to the <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName> wherever he may be. Our power, our influence, our prosperity, our agricultural, mechanical and manufacturing wealth have increased far beyond all expectation.--That banner which is borne up, and which has been carried forward by the unseen yet steady hand of progress, has attained a position far in advance of the hopes and anticipations of the founders of our Government. &#x0022;Surely no people have been blessed as we have been, and it is melancholy to think that all is now about to be sacrificed upon the altar of passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If the judgments of men were consulted, if the admonitions of their consciences were respected, the <rs>Union</rs> would yet be saved from overthrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Every calm, considerate, and reflecting mind is filled with apprehensions of the most painful character; every patriotic heart throbs with anxiety, and all conservative men throughout our extended country are seeking to devise some means of escape from the evils that now threaten our peace and the continued existence of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>All see and feel and know that the danger is imminent, and all true patriots are exerting themselves to save us from the perils now impending over us. The dark gloom of apprehension is fast gathering around us, and if saved at all, the wisdom, prudence, and patriotism of the country can alone (aided by <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>) be relied upon to relieve us in this hour of our extremity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> My inaugural message, presented to you just <num value="1">one</num> year ago to-day, was prepared in anticipation of the occurrences of the past <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, which have cast their shadow like a pall over the business, financial and commercial of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I thought I saw then a storm ahead, that threatened to be destructive in its consequences; and anxious to avert its fury, if possible, I made <num value="2">two</num> recommendations, which, if adopted, would (in my judgment,) have saved us from the consequences now upon us. In this opinion, however, you did not concur, and no action was taken in regard to either. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Seeing no other hope of averting the threatened danger, I cordially endorsed the proposition presented by <persName n="Memminger,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName><surname>Memminger</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and <persName n="Starke,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Starke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Starke</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, for a conference with those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If that proposition had been accepted, I am entirely satisfied that the results would have been most happy; that it would have tended in a great degree to the settlement and satisfactory adjustment of the painful controversy which had so long existed, and which seemed to be increased by time and untoward circumstances, between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The questions would have been presented in a form and shape, and in a manner so imposing, that action must have followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>That action could not have tended otherwise than toward peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> I now again most respectfully renew the recommendation, presented in my inaugural message, in the following extract: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> &#x0022;The only mode, therefore, of remedying the evil that occurs to me, <hi rend="italics">under the <rs>Constitution</rs>,</hi> is provided in the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> article thereof. --Summon a Convention of all the <name>States</name>, that a fall and free conference may be had between the representatives of the people, elected for this purpose, and thus ascertain whether the questions in controversy cannot be settled upon some basis mutually satisfactory to both sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>If such a Convention shall assemble, and after free and full consultation and comparison of opinions, they shall find that the differences between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding States are irreconcilable, let them consider the question of a peaceable separation, and the adjustment of all questions relating to the disposition of the common property between the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If they can be reconciled, let them adjust the terms, and give them such sanctions as will render them effective. </p> </q><bibl n="Inaugural Address of Governor of Virginia"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> &#x0022; I suggest, therefore, that you adopt resolutions in favor of the call of such a Convention, and appeal to the <name>Legislatures</name> of the several States to unite in the application proposed <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> to be made to Congress, in pursuance of the provisions of the article aforesaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>If the non-slaveholding States shall fail or refuse to unite in the application, such failure or refusal will furnish conclusive evidence of a determination, on their part, to keep up the agitation, and to continue their aggressions upon us. If the <rs>Convention</rs> shall meet, and the question cannot be satisfactorily adjusted, it will furnish evidence, equally conclusive, of their determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In either event, the people of the <rs>South</rs> will clearly understand what they are to expect in the future.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to which reference is here made, is in the following words, and I quote it, inasmuch as it will be referred to hereafter in this communication: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> &#x0022;The Congress, whenever <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or on the applications of the <name>Legislatures</name>, of <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the <name>Legislatures</name> of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the several States, or by Conventions in <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> thereof, as the <num value="1">one</num> or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the <rs>Congress</rs>.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Under this article, the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> has been amended on <num value="3">three</num> several occasions in our history, and those amendments have all been exceedingly valuable and important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> amendments were ratified by some of the <name>States</name> in <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, by others in <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>, and by the residue in <dateStruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></dateStruct>.--Another amendment was proposed in <dateStruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></dateStruct>, which the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> announced in his Message to both Houses, dated <date value="1798-01-08">January 8th, 1798,</date> as having been adopted by the constitutional number of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The last amendment was proposed in <dateStruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></dateStruct>, and adopted by the constitutional number of States in <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>These amendments were proposed and adopted at periods less alarming, perhaps, than at the present day. Still, their adoption was necessary to insure peace and quiet to our country, and were demanded by a proper deference to public opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> In the present condition of public affairs, why cannot such additional amendments as the circumstances now existing require, be proposed for ratification and adoption ! The necessity is manifest, and the duty to adopt all constitutional measures before we resort to the ultimate remedy of secession, is imperative.--Is it not monstrous to see a Government like ours destroyed, merely because men cannot agree about a domestic institution, which existed at the formation of the <rs>Government</rs>, and which is now recognized by <num value="15">fifteen</num> out of the <num value="33">thirty-three</num> States composing the <rs>Union</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> In support of my position, I quote from the <name>Message</name> of <persName n="Floyd,Governor,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Floyd,John,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, dated <date value="1833-01-25">January 25th, 1833.</date> He was <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest and most reliable of the <rs>State-Rights</rs> men of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It wears the aspect of dissatisfaction with your decision, and, in connection with other portions of the message, indicates distrust of, and hostility on his part, towards this Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The duty which I owe to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> demands a notice of so much of this communication as relates to our State, and the action of her Legislature. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> Why <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> alone, of all the <rs>Southern States</rs>, should have been singled out for comment, is to me unaccountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The resolutions of the <orgName n="South Carolina Legislature" type="legislature">South Carolina Legislature</orgName>, asking the conference, were transmitted to all the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and none of those States responded except <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.--Why no complaint of the other States who declined to accede to the proposal?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>After a careful examination of your resolutions, since the perusal of the <rs>Governor</rs>'s Message, I see nothing that could have entitled them to the special notice that has been bestowed upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We can get no safer or better guarantee than the present Constitution, and that has proved impotent to protect us against the fanaticism of the <rs>North</rs>.&#x0022; It may be too late, now, to confer with her sister States; but there was a time when she could have conferred with them with great propriety, and perhaps advantage, to herself and them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> The faithful, prompt and just execution of all the provisions of the present Constitution will not prove satisfactory to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>We cannot consent to relieve them from their embarrassing situation, by permitting them to realize the money value for their slaves, by selling them to us, and thus prepare them without any loss of property, to accommodate themselves to the northern free soil idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But should they unite their destiny with us, and become stars in the southern galaxy &mdash; members of a great southern confederation &mdash; we will receive them with open arms and an enthusiastic greeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>This movement, begun ostensibly for the <hi rend="italics">protection</hi> of slave property, for the diffusion and the preservation of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, is to be so managed and directed now, as to force States holding slave property to free themselves from it, <hi rend="italics">by emancipation.</hi> This is the avowed policy of the late Executive of a State, interested in an institution sanctioned by the teachings and precepts of Christianity, and promotive of a higher degree of civilization and refinement &mdash; an institution that ought to be diffused and extended, and the permanency and prosperity of which ought to be insured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Can it be possible that such suggestions can exert an influence upon the future action of either of the border States--that they can be coerced into an union with those who thus manifest a determined purpose to rule or ruin them !

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> I now propose to present, in contrast with these views of the <rs>Executive</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, the sentiments announced by her <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> in this <name>Capitol</name> on the <date value="1860-01-19">19th of January, 1860.</date> In his address he declares, &#x0022;I can confidently affirm that such an interchange of kindly feeling as <hi rend="italics">you have</hi> exhibited, <hi rend="italics">cannot fail to bind together the hearts of our people in closer ties of sympathy and fellow hip.</hi>&#x0022; Does the conduct of the late Executive of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, in his recent message, show that such has been the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>No observer of events for some months past can fail to have been struck with the numerous evidences of hostility and prejudice which have been exhibited towards <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> by very many of the leading and most influential public men of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>We have seen nothing going to show the existence of those &#x0022;ties of sympathy and fellowship&#x0022; which bind &#x0022;together the hearts of our people,&#x0022; so handsomely alluded to by <persName n="Memminger,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> on that interesting occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Distrust of us, and distrust without sufficient cause, (a result greatly to be deplored,) appears to have severed the &#x0022; ties of sympathy and fellowship&#x0022; which ought to have existed at this critical juncture in our affairs, not only between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, but between all the slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Such taunts as have been indulged in towards this Commonwealth by the late Executive of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, do not exhibit that spirit of comity which should at all times, and more especially at this time, characterize the intercourse and relations between sister States, with a common domestic institution, that can be best defended and maintained by united counsels and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Such allusions to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should never have been made by the <rs>Executive</rs> of a State who feels her &#x0022;obligation for the large contribution of mind and effort which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> has made to the common cause,&#x0022; and who is more largely indebted to her for manifestations of particular concern in her &#x0022;welfare.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> In this address it was also declared, &#x0022;that when we (<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>,) propose a conference, we do so with the full understanding that we are but <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> in that conference, entitled like all the others to express our opinions, but willing <hi rend="italics">to respect and abide by the united judgment of the whole.</hi> If our pace is too fast for some, we are content to walk slower; our earnest wish is that all may keep together.&#x0022; These are noble sentiments, and declare a sound and proper position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>In a movement so important, and involving consequences so serious to all the slaveholding States, no <num value="1">one</num> State should have ventured to move, without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> having given timely notice to the others of her purpose, even if she did not intend &#x0022;to respect and abide by the united judgment of the whole.&#x0022; Such action on the part of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> would at this moment, in all probability, have enabled &#x0022;all&#x0022; to &#x0022;keep together.&#x0022; What effect her movement may have upon the future, time alone can disclose. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, a sovereign State, had a right to adopt the line of policy she has pursued; and I would have made no special reference to her course, if I had not been indirectly invited to do so by her late Executive, in his uncalled for references to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>It has been my rule, as the <rs>Executive</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, to exhibit, in my official intercourse with the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, a spirit of comity, and to manifest all that respect which is due from <num value="1">one</num> State to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Even in this state of the case, the <rs>South</rs> has been so for bearing and unselfish that she has never asked for the division of her States, that the equipoise might be restored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> An advantage has been gained over us in another respect, equally important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The organized Territories (with the exception of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>) are destined to become free States; and it may be that even this Territory will be of like character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>All of these Territories will come into the <rs>Union</rs> near about the same time; and while the <rs>North</rs> has the advantage over us now of <num value="6">six</num> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, that advantage must, in the ordinary course of events, if the <rs>Union</rs> shall survive, be greatly increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Besides, the territory of the slave States is generally large; the territory of the free States generally small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/><placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> is made equal to <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> in the <name>Senate</name>; <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> is a counterpoise to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, with its wild fanaticism, is an offset to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, the empire State of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> Can it be surprising that the people of the <rs>South</rs> should be restive and uneasy under such circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>In addition, a candidate has just been elected to the <name>Presidency</name> who gave utterance to the following atrocious sentiments, indicating his bitter hostility to the <rs>South</rs> and her institutions: &#x0022;In my opinion, it (the slavery agitation) will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>A house divided against itself cannot stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>I believe this Government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>I do not expect the <rs>Union</rs> to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>It will become all <num value="1">one</num> thing or all the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the <name>States</name>, old as well as new, North as well as South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>And again, he says: <q>&#x0022; I embrace with pleasure this opportunity of declaring my <hi rend="italics">disapprobation</hi> of that clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which denies to a portion of the colored people the right of suffrage.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> When a President is elected, entertaining and boldly avowing such sentiments &mdash; when, to this moment, they have never been retracted or qualified, have we not reason for alarm and resentment? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> The Union is now disrupted; let the <rs>North</rs> bear the blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>They have brought these sad and deplorable results upon the country, and the candid and honest men of the world will hold them responsible for the destruction of a Government that has challenged the admiration and commanded the respect of the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the world, they will be held answerable for this calamity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> They yet have the power to end the strife and excitement, and restore confidence to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Will they do it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>I await their response, but not without apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Time, however, will soon furnish the answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The present state of things cannot continue long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>A change for the better or the worse must soon come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> Can it be supposed that a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> can end in the organization of a Northern and <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, embracing the <name>States</name> and Territory on this side of the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>I entertain no such opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>I consider it not only possible, but highly probable, that when disunion shall come, we will have <num value="4">four</num> organizations, independent and distinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The States and Territories on the <rs>Pacific</rs>, by reason of their locality and isolation, will form <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, with New York, in consequence of their identity of opinions on the subject of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery, and their other fanatical ideas of like kind, will constitute the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The border slave States, with <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and the <rs>Northwestern States</rs> and <rs>Territories</rs>, will form the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>For this organization, New Orleans would be its chief city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>It would be the exporting and importing city for the <name>States</name> in existence, and those which may be hereafter formed out of the immense unsettled territory which it would possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Besides, the unsold public lands would invite population, and their sales would furnish the means to defray governmental expenses, in part at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and the northwestern territory originally formed a part of the domain of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.--This organization will keep her united with what formerly belonged to her, and constituted a part of her territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The Cotton States would form the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>All these Confederacies being thus formed, although <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> might at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attach themselves to the <rs>Cotton State</rs> organization, a very short time would elapse before they would find it to be their interest to connect themselves with the border and Northwestern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Their trade, their interests, their business relations, are with those States, and all upon the waters of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and its tributaries must necessarily be united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It <placeName reg="Louisiana, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> remained in alliance with the <rs>Cotton States</rs>, her great city of <placeName reg="New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014214">New Orleans</placeName> would have to compete with <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, for the export and import trade, and the most she could hope for, would be <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> Such an arrangement would be followed by a struggle for the key of the gulf, (<placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>,) and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> organization would have it, cost what it might in treasure and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It would be too important an acquisition to give up to the <rs>Cotton State Confederacy</rs>, without a desperate struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>These are my speculations as to the results that are to follow a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>These results are bad enough, but may be much worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It is not given to us to read the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>We may, however, speculate about it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> When the <rs>Union</rs> was formed, it was not expected or believed that the domestic institutions of all the <name>States</name> should be alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The institutions of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> were never intended to be the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The people of each were invested with full power to determine whether slavery should exist, and the former decided against the institution; the latter decided in its favor &mdash; as each had the undoubted right to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> In the list of grievances against the <rs>North</rs>, it is somewhat remarkable, that in our own State so little has been said in regard to the conduct of the <rs>Governors</rs> of <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs> and <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, in refusing to surrender fugitives from justice who participated in the <rs type="place">Harper's Ferry</rs> raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>They were regularly indicted; the <rs>Governors</rs> of those States were applied to in due form to deliver them up; the application was refused; and our people, instead of taking a stand, and making an issue upon this practical question, seem inclined to ignore it, and unite in the complaints of the cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The complaints of those States are rather against the financial and commercial policy of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, than any action or want of action on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The slave-owners of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> have suffered seriously the wrongs inflicted upon us by the conduct of these Executives have been great: still, we have heard but little complaint in our own State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The grievances complained of mainly, are those which the cotton States plead as a justification for their action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Would it not be well for us to redress the wrongs our own people have suffered, before we undertake to redress the wrongs of others, who have suffered much less, so far as slavery is concerned, than we have done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Our action should be based upon the wrongs done to our own people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> The proposition for the call of a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>, to determine the position which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> shall take, in view of passing events, appear to have been received with very general <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>As the subject has been much discussed by the people in their primary meetings, it is not only proper, but it is doubtless expected, that I shall refer to it in this communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>It is pleasant, alike to the private citizen and the public officer, to know that his views and opinions are endorsed by those around him; that he is backed by the popular sentiment of the day; but there are times and occasions, in the history of every man, when it is imperative to him to adhere to his convictions of duty, maintain his opinions firmly, but courteously, even at the hazard of being found in a minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>I have no hesitation in expressing my opinion upon this or any other question of public concern. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> I have my convictions upon this question, and I give expression to them, in declaring my opposition at this time to the call of a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>I see no necessity for it at this time, nor do I now see any good practical result that can be accomplished by it. I do not consider this a propitious time to moot the question, and I apprehend, from indications that have been exhibited, that serious difficulties and embarrassments will attend the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Subsequent events may show the necessity for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> In <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, when the existence of the <rs>Union</rs> was seriously threatened, when the danger was imminent, the <name>Legislature</name> accomplished everything desired, in a manner as satisfactory as it would have been accomplished if the mode now suggested had been adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>On neither occasion was the <name>Legislature</name> chosen with reference to the events which subsequently occurred, and which devolved upon them the necessity for such action as was taken, and which gave so much satisfaction to the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the whole country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> In my inaugural message I made this recommendation, which, if adopted, would perhaps have relieved us, to some extent, from the complications with which we are now embarrassed: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> &#x0022; I also suggest that a commission, to consist of <num value="2">two</num> of our most intelligent, discreet and experienced statesmen, shall be appointed, whose duty it shall be to visit the <name>Legislatures</name> of those States which have passed laws to obstruct the execution of the fugitive slave act, and insist, in the name of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, upon their unconditional repeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>In support of the suggestion of the appointment of a commission, a precedent is to be found in the history of our own State, in the appointment of the distinguished <rs>Benjamin Watkins Leigh</rs>, who was commissioned to visit the <orgName n="South Carolina Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of South Carolina</orgName>, at the time of the controversy between that State and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The existence of the <rs>Union</rs> was then greatly imperiled, and the action of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> exerted a most happy influence in bringing about a settlement that averted the danger and restored peace to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>That crisis in public affairs was almost as serious and alarming as the present.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Inaugural Address of Governor of Virginia"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> In renewing the recommendation at this time, I annex a modification, and that is, that Commissioners shall not be sent to either of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The occurrences of the last <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> have satisfied me that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> puritanism has no respect for human constitutions, and so little regard for the <rs>Union</rs> that they would not sacrifice their prejudices, or smother their resentments to perpetuate it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> I further recommend, that Commissioners be sent to the <name>Legislatures</name> or Conventions of all the slaveholding States, to confer with them, with a view of ascertain what demands, in the nature of amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or otherwise, will be satisfactory in this exigency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The adoption of this plan will in all probability tend to secure harmony and produce unity of action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The controversy now has reached a point when <hi rend="italics">it must be settled</hi> on some fair, just and permanent basis, if we are to be re-united, and peace, quiet and order restored to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The excitement now existing is ruinous to the financial and commercial business, and to the agricultural, planting, mechanical, mercantile and manufacturing interests of all sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Unless a settlement of the controversy shall be speedily effected, every species of property must fall to merely nominal prices, and a scene of general and ruinous bankruptcy, far exceeding, in extent and severity, any that has preceded it, must be the inevitable result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Even now, hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num> have been thrown out of employment, and at this inclement season poverty, want and misery, must be the portion of them and their dependent families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>It is time the conservative spirit of the country was aroused and stimulated to energetic action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>No time is to be lost in putting into immediate requisition all fair, honorable and constitutional means that promise to secure a satisfactory and permanent adjustment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> What, then, is necessary to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The Northern States must strike from their statute books their Personal Liberty bills, and fulfill their constitutional obligations in regard to fugitive slaves and fugitives from justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>If our slaves escape into non-slaveholding States, they must be delivered up; if abandoned, depraved and desperately wicked men come into slave States to incite insurrections, or to commit other crimes against our laws, and escape into free States, they must be given up for trial and punishment, when lawfully demanded by the constituted authorities of those States whose laws have been violated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num></hi>--We must have proper and effective guarantees for the protection of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We can never consent to the abolition of slavery in the <rs>District</rs>, until <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> shall emancipate her slaves; and not then, unless it shall be demanded by the citizens of the <rs>District</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num></hi>--Our equality in the <name>States</name> and Territories must be fully recognized, and our rights of person and property adequately protected and secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>We must have guarantees that slavery shall not be interdicted in any Territory now belonging to, or which may hereafter be acquired by the <rs>General Government</rs>; either by the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> or a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName>: that we shall be permitted to pass through the free States and Territories without molestation; and if a slave shall be abducted, that the <rs>State</rs> in which he or she shall be lost, shall pay the full value of such slave to the owner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num></hi>--Like guarantees must be given, that the transmission of slaves between the slaveholding States, either by land or water, shall not be interfered with. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num></hi>--The passage and enforcement of rigid laws for the punishment of such persons in the free States as shall organize, or aid and abet in organizing, either by the contribution of money, arms, munitions of war, or in any other mode whatsoever, companies of men, with a view to assail the slaveholding States, and to excite slaves to insurrection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num></hi>--That the general government shall be deprived of the power of appointing to local offices in the slaveholding States, persons who are hostile to their institutions, or inimical to their rights &mdash; the object being to prevent the appointing power from using patronage to sow the seeds of strife and dissension between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding classes in the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> These guarantees can be given without prejudice to the honor or rights, and without a sacrifice of the interests, of either of the non-slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We ask nothing, therefore, which is not clearly right, and necessary to our protection: And, surely, when so much is at stake, it will be freely, cheerfully, and promptly assented to. It is the interest of the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> to preserve the <rs>Government</rs> from destruction; and they should omit the use of no proper or honorable means to avert so great a calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The public safety and welfare demand instant action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> Many of the fanatics in the <rs>Northern States</rs> are constantly calling attention to the fact, that the number of slave-owners, as compared with the white population in the slave States, is small; and hence the inference that the non-slaveholder is not loyal to the <rs>State</rs>, and would not willingly defend the institution.--This is a most serious mistake, and is well calculated to make an erroneous impression upon the <rs>Northern</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Such a representation does serious injustice to that loyal and patriotic class of our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It is a reflection upon them, not warranted by their conduct, now or heretofore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The number of persons in this State in the year <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, charged with taxes on slaves was <num value="53874">53,874</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The number of persons charged with taxes on lands in the same year, was <num value="159088">159,088</num>.--Most of the persons charged with taxes on slaves, are the owners of lands also; and others who own lands, own no slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The number of persons charged with taxes, other than owners of lands and slaves, is <num value="201000">201,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>All these parties have a common interest in the protection of persons and property, and each feels that in protecting the rights and property of the others, he is securing and protecting his own, whether of little or great value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>As the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">chief magistrate</rs>, and as a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, it is a source of pleasure to me to know that there is no jealousy or distrust, and that harmony and confidence exist between these classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>If the <rs>Northern</rs> people entertain the opinion that the non-slaveholders of the <rs>South</rs> are not reliable and trustworthy in all respects, they are most grossly mistaken and deceived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> I have seen it stated that in the <rs>Empire</rs> <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">City of New York</placeName> the owners of <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> numbered less than <num value="16000">16,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Do those who are not owners of <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> feel no interest in the property of the <num value="15000">15,000</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Would they be unwilling to defend or protect it, if it were in danger of destruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It might be charged with the same propriety, and with as much truth, in this instance, that feeling no interest in common with the owner, they would not risk their lives for the protection of his <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, worth <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>They are interested &mdash; deeply interested in all that relates to the public prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Their prosperity, their comfort, and the comfort of their families are dependent upon the protection of the <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> rights of property of every individual in the community in which he lives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> I have always reverenced the <rs>State-Rights</rs> doctrines of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, as inculcated in the resolutions of <num value="98">98</num> and the report of <num value="99">99</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>I believe the doctrines therein asserted, and the principles therein affirmed, to be worthy of all acceptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>I cordially endorse them, and in so doing endorse the doctrine of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>I do not propose to go into an argument in support of my opinion upon this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The subject has been ably discussed for years on both sides, and those arguments are familiar to all reading and well-informed men. I am content to rest the question upon the discussions which have taken place, and leave the people to form their own opinions and draw their own conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>I refer to it, in this connection, to declare my unqualified hostility to the doctrine of <hi rend="italics">coercion</hi> by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> In my canvass for the office I now hold, I declared my opinion frankly and fearlessly on this question, and every man in the <rs>State</rs> had the amplest opportunity to be informed of my position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>In a written address &#x0022;to the voters of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>,&#x0022; issued on <date value="1859-05-12">the 12th of May, 1859</date> I stated, &#x0022;Should it be the pleasure of the people to elevate me to the <orgName>office of Governor</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>I will endeavor in my administration to carry out the time honored State-Rights principle of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>If at any time during my administration the <rs>Federal Government</rs> shall attempt to interfere with the rights and institutions of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; if it shall at any time interfere with the rights of slavery or the rights of slaveholders in our State, I will be prepared, with the aid of the people, to resist any efforts to coerce us into submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>I will resist any attempt of Federal troops to cross our line to execute such unjust, iniquitous and unconstitutional laws, either in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> or in any other Southern State.&#x0022; My position now on this question, is what it was then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It has not been changed or modified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>I will regard an attempt to pass Federal troops across the <placeName key="possibilities=23" n="1.000 10" reg=",">territory of Virginia</placeName>, for the purpose of coercing a Southern seceding State, as an act of invasion, which should be met and repelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The allegiance of every citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> is due to her; and when her flag is unfurled, it is his duty to rally to its support and defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> who will not respond to her call, is a traitor to her rights and her honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> I am not without hope that the present difficulties will find a satisfactory solution in the end. Let the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States and Western New York be sloughed off. In the last war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States entertained the treasonable design of forming an alliance with <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Let them now consummate it. At the time the <orgName n="Hartford Convention" type="convention">Hartford Convention</orgName> met, the most treasonable body that has ever assembled in our country, it was declared in their report, &#x0022;Whenever it shall appear that these causes (of our calamities) are radical and permanent, a separation, by equitable arrangement, will be preferable to an alliance by constraint, among nominal friends, but real enemies, inflamed by mutual hatred and jealousy, and inviting, by intestine divisions, contempt and aggression from abroad.&#x0022; The causes of our calamities &#x0022;are radical and permanent,&#x0022; and we are indebted to <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> for them &mdash; They are our &#x0022;nominal friends, but real enemies;&#x0022; they have originated more trouble, caused more strife, and created more hatred, dissension and division in our country, than all the other States combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They have uniformly opposed the acquisition of territory, and consequently the organization and admission of new States into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>If their policy had prevailed, we should have had at this day the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, and no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>All those States carved out of the <placeName reg="Louisiana, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana territory</placeName>, the <rs>Northwestern</rs> territory, Spanish territory, and <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> territory, would have been excluded from association and union with us. They have shown themselves the uncompromising enemies of progress; they have sternly resisted every attempt to extend our empire, under the fear that &#x0022; <hi rend="italics">the <rs>Western States</rs>, multiplied in number and augmented in population, will control the interests of the whole.</hi>&#x0022; Existing difficulties furnish abundant reasons and the best opportunity for severing our connection with them; and we ought not to permit the occasion to pass unimproved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> A Confederacy, composed of the remaining States, can arrange terms under which they can live harmoniously and happily together; and now that the <rs>Union</rs> is disrupted, we should avail ourselves of this favorable opportunity to commence the work of reconstruction: In commencing and prosecuting this important work, we must look to our security, the protection of our institutions, and our domestic peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Let the fabric be reared, discarding all rotten and unsound material, and exhibiting an ordinary share of prudence and wisdom in its fabrication, and there is but little reason to doubt that it can be constructed upon fair and satisfactory terms, and the rights and interests, the institutions and honor of all its members can be satisfactorily secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We can form such a Confederacy as will draw to it the affections and sympathies of its citizens, thereby securing for it a foundation on which it can rest in safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> Such is my plan for relief from the difficulties, the perplexities and the complications which now environ us, and I present it for the consideration of my countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Every consideration of duty to ourselves and those who are to succeed us, <hi rend="italics">demands that the controversy shall be settled finally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It can be no longer delayed.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> The times require prudence, wisdom and patriotism; union, harmony and conciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Every man should be willing to risk himself and his future prospects to quell the strife and restore peace to the nation, torn as it now is by dissension, and threatened with anarchy, trusting to the people to do justice to his intentions, even if they should think his judgment in error. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> In the present posture of affairs it becomes us to cast about and ascertain in what way the interests of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> can be preserved and advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It is neither politic nor wise to neglect our <hi rend="italics">material prosperity,</hi> and permit it to be sacrificed and destroyed by political or sectional broils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>This obligation upon us is imperative, whether the <rs>Union</rs> shall continue to exist or be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>In either event, our material prosperity should be with us an object of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance, and to its advancement our efforts should be steadily directed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> We have the best port in the country; and no man can doubt if direct trade were established between <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, it would give increased prosperity to every interest in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It would secure for us a commercial independence that would prove of immense value in any contingency that might occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The present and prospective system of railroads in the <rs>State</rs> already points to the great Northwest, and must soon become an important part of the immense network of roads which now reach <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and are fast progressing towards the <rs>Pacific</rs>; and the system, when complete, will be entirely, or almost so, within the central belt from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> then, whether in or out of the <rs>Union</rs>, as it stands at present, has it in her power to place herself in the position in reference to this great interior and exterior trade, which really belongs to her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> With ships sailing to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, at regular intervals from the port of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, an import trade could be established, and importers in the interior cities throughout the <rs>West</rs>, and some portions of the <rs>Southwest</rs>, would receive their supplies through this channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>These importations would all pass over our railroads to their intersection with the railroads of other States, especially those of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and some of the <rs>Northwestern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The export and import business would be concentrated upon the <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> roads, and would thus insure to them controlling power in the arrangement, securing great benefits to the <rs>State</rs>, and good profits to the stockholders.--It may be added that this commerce is already in existence, and only awaits the easiest, cheapest and most expeditions means of reaching the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, to be conveyed thence to all points of destination, both outward and inward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> I am entirely satisfied, that if direct trade were established between <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, it would result in the enlargement of our cities, the increase of our agricultural products, the development of our resources, the creation of manufactures, the enhancement of the value of lands, the opening of the coal and mineral beds, make the stock which the <rs>State</rs> owns in her railroads productive &mdash; and the end would be, a diminution of the <rs>State</rs> debt, and a reduction in the rate of taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>If such would be the results, the subject is eminently deserving of the most serious consideration.--The attention of the people has been directed to the question, and the time is therefore favorable for decisive action upon it. I leave it to your wisdom to digest a plan that will secure the great end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> I have thus presented my reflections on Federal relations frankly, and with that independence which is becoming the position I occupy at this interesting and dangerous epoch in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It is only by a free comparison of opinions, and a manly examination of the questions in issue, that we can hope to evolve the true state of facts and provide a remedy for existing troubles and threatened dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Having performed my duty, the whole matter is with you, for such action as the wisdom and patriotism of the <name>Legislature</name> may adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Be your conclusions what they may, I am satisfied they will be results of your convictions as to what is best to be done in this emergency for the honor and interests of our beloved Commonwealth and our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> In conclusion, I have but to add that the will of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> will furnish an inflexible rule for the direction of my own action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>My destiny is linked indissolubly with hers.

<head><rs type="role" reg="Auditor">Auditor</rs> of public Accounts.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> The report of the <rs>Auditor</rs> of Public Accounts is herewith transmitted, and is deserving of the serious consideration of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It is characterised by great ability, and embodies many valuable suggestions on questions in which the <rs>State</rs> has a deep and vital interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It brings to your attention several practical questions, in a clear and forcible manner &mdash; all of which imperatively demand legislative action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>I confidently expect that his recommendations will commend themselves to your favorable consideration, and that the measures be proposes will receive your sanction, and at an early day of the session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Legislation on these subjects is imperatively demanded, if the <rs>State</rs> is to be protected in future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> That portion of his report which relates to condemned slaves is recommended specially to your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Additional legislation on this subject is indispensably necessary to protect the <rs>State</rs> from imposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>At this time, and indeed since I have been in office, the prices fixed by the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> upon condemned slaves will average at least <num value="0.1">ten percent</num> more than the slaves would have brought at public or private sale, if their characters had been unexceptionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Little or no attention seems to be paid to that provision of the law, which declares that the &#x0022;value shall be the <hi rend="italics">cash price</hi> for which he would sell <hi rend="italics">at public sale.</hi> with a knowledge of his condemnation.&#x0022; You will perhaps be astonished to learn from the <rs>Auditor</rs>'s Report that condemned slaves have cost the <rs>State</rs>, in the <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> preceding the year <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>, the sum of <measure n="331463dollars" type="currency">$331,463</measure> <num value="90">90</num>, and that the <rs>State</rs> realized from their sales during the same period the sum of <measure n="150736dollars" type="currency">$150,736</measure> <num value="96">96</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>These convicts were therefore put upon the <rs>State</rs> at a price greatly exceeding their value, and the taxpayers of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> were made to bear the burden of <measure n="180000dollars" type="currency">$180,000</measure>, required to make up the amount of this high valuation fixed by the <rs type="place">Courts</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> In this connection, I ask your attention to the abstract of the laws upon this subject, now existing in the other slaveholding States, to see whether this gross injustice cannot be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It ought to be removed, and I appeal to your wisdom to provide an adequate remedy for a grievance to which the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> are now subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The law of either of the other slaveholding States is more just in its provisions, and I have no hesitation in recommending a change in the existing law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> I recommend also, that some amendment shall be made to section <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> of chapter <num value="212">two hundred and twelve</num> of the <name>Code</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The necessity for this amendment is clearly pointed out by the <rs>Auditor</rs>, and to the cases mentioned in his report, I refer you. Unless some legislative action be had upon this subject, I will feel it to be my duty to restore these slaves to their owners, requiring from them satisfactory security that they shall be removed forthwith from the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The State ought not to have the possession and services of the slave, and yet refuse to pay a fair cash value for him, merely because the owner is not a resident of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> I recommend that sheriffs shall be required to execute their bonds in the <rs type="place">Circuit Courts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The Judges are better informed in regard to the legality of such bonds, and will be much more careful in ascertaining the sufficiency and responsibility of the security that may be offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The present law is seriously defective, and the suggestions of the <rs>Auditor</rs> are entitled to great weight in the action you may take on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The interests of the <rs>State</rs> demand action at the present session, and the defects in existing laws require to occurred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> The suggestions in regard to delinquent and other lands are deserving of your attention. --Those suggestions appear to me to be valuable, and it carried out, could not fail to have a beneficial effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The Auditor is very familiar with these subjects, and any recommendation he may make in regard to them is entitled to great weight, and should commend itself to your favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> In regard to the present mode of ascertaining the taxable subjects of the <rs>State</rs>, I am persuaded that the results could be arrived at, in a manner equally satisfactory, and at the same time a great saving of expense now annually incurred could be effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>If both these objects can be secured in the present embarrassed financial condition of the country, surely I will be fully justified in directing your attention to so important a subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>On the <dateStruct value="--35"><day reg="2">thirty-fifth</day></dateStruct> page of the report, you will find a recommendation that the bonds of the <rs>State</rs> stock <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, amounting to <measure n="2274193dollars" type="currency">$2,274,193</measure> <num value="21">21</num>, now on deposit with the <rs>Treasurer</rs>, shall &#x0022;be converted into registered stock.&#x0022; This course should be adopted, or some endorsement should be made upon them, to show but they are the property of the <name>Bank</name> by which they were deposited, and that they cannot be transferred or register, without the order or assignment of the proper officers of such Bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>This is a most valuable recommendation, and I am gratified to know that it meets the approval of the <rs>Treasurer</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> This report contains many other valuable suggestions, that should command your approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>I cannot too strongly urge upon you the necessity for prompt legislative action upon the several subjects, so forcibly and clearly presented by this intelligent, experienced and laborious public officer. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>I do not believe there is a square mile of vacant land in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; and yet we are issuing patents from the commencement of the year to the close of it. Such a policy as we are pursuing is calculated to postpone indefinitely the settlement of titles; and it furnishes to those who are so disposed the means of perpetrating trends upon innocent and unsuspecting parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>If the unsettled portions of our State are to be filled up, we must adopt such a policy as will quiet titles, and assure parties in possession that they are not to be disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>If our titles had been settled, the population of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would have been much larger than it is, and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of acres of land, now in original forest, would have been brought into cultivation, and made to bloom and blossom as the rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs> took a recess until <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>These resolutions &mdash; with little or no debate, and with only some brief explanations by members as they voted &mdash; were passed by the almost unanimous vote of <num value="112">112</num> ayes to <num value="5">5</num> nays!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>I have caused the buildings to be examined for the purpose of ascertaining the best mode of improvement, and herewith present a plan, for such an addition as will furnish the requisite room for the smallest expenditure of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>I hope it may be your pleasure to adopt this or some other plan, and make such an appropriation as will be necessary to effect the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>It is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance that this matter shall be promptly attended to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/> Chapter <num value="14">14</num>, section <num value="16">16</num> of the <name>Code</name>, authorizes the appointment of <num value="7">seven</num> assistant keepers in the penitentiary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Some few months ago an application was made by the <rs>Superintendent</rs>, and it was sustained by the <orgName n="Directors Board" type="board">Board of Directors</orgName>, for the appointment of an additional assistant keeper, to be placed in charge of a portion of the convicts employed in the shoe shop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>The number now employed in this branch of business is <num value="137">one hundred and thirty-seven</num>, all in the same room, and all superintended by <num value="1">one</num> assistant keeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>It is proposed to divide this room by a partition, and place <num value="0.5">one half</num> this number in charge of another assistant proposed to be appointed. --The suggestion is in my opinion wise, and if I had possessed the power under the law, I would have had it carried out. It is neither prudent nor safe to have so large a number in <num value="1">one</num> room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>The law confines the number of assistant keepers to <num value="7">seven</num>, and I recommend that it be so amended as to authorize the appointment of an additional assistant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/> I suggest also that you so amend the criminal laws as to prohibit any person from being confined in the penitentiary for a shorter period than <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. It requires at least <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> to acquire a trade, and those who are confined for a shorter period are a burden to the institution, and an expense to the <rs>State In</rs> all such cases, let some other punishment be substituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/> I recommend that the <rs>State</rs> shall be divided into <num value="12">twelve</num> divisions, and the brigades be rearranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>At present we have but <num value="5">five</num> divisions--<num value="3">three</num> in the east and <num value="2">two</num> in the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>It is impossible for a <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major General</rs> to command either of these divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>He can never know the men under his command, and it is equally impossible that they can know him. If called into service, they would meet as strangers; there would be no bond of confidence between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>In the absence of all knowledge of each other, if they proved serviceable at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it would be but little short of miraculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>Hence I suggest that the divisions be increased in number, so that the commanding officer may have the opportunity to be brought into contact with his men. In the <num value="2">two</num> divisions in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> there are in each at least <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men subject to militia duty, and who would be, in the event of trouble, called into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The simple announcement of this fact demonstrates the utter absurdity of the present arrangement of the divisions, and shows the necessity of a rearrangement throughout the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>The existing arrangement was established in <dateStruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Since that time population has greatly increased, and the necessity for an increase in the number of divisions is patent, if we are to have an effective force, reliable at all times, and under all circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>I recommend, therefore, in the strongest terms, an increase in the number of divisions to <num value="12">twelve</num>, and the rearrangement of all the brigades throughout the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/> In this connection, I also recommend that a distinctive uniform for cavalry, artillery, infantry and riflemen shall be prescribed by law. Under the present system we have every description of uniform; and if the <orgName n="State volunteers" type="volunteers">volunteers of the State</orgName> were called into service we would not know from the uniform whether they were of us or against us.--This should be corrected, but it is not possible to correct it without a positive law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/> Reform is greatly needed in this branch of expenditure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Under the law the quarterly statements of all the banks are required to be published in the city papers, and at a large annual expense, without corresponding advantages, so far as I can see or understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>No <num value="2">two</num> of them are made up in the same way &mdash; and it is utterly impossible therefore to prepare a comparative statement from the returns which are sent to this department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>I recommend that the law requiring their publication in the city papers be repealed leaving so much of the law in force as requires them to be published by the banks in the towns and cities in which they are located.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>I recommend also that so much of the law as allows a salary of <measure n="1100dollars" type="currency">$1,100</measure> to the printer of the <name>Senate</name>, be repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/> On the <dateStruct value="-11-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> day of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, the <name>Banks</name> in the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> suspended specie payments and very shortly thereafter the other <rs>Banks</rs> in the <rs>State</rs> followed their example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>The fact having been communicated to me officially by the <rs>Treasurer</rs>, I caused the accompanying order to be sent to that officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Under the circumstances all of which were carefully considered, I came to the conclusion that it was safer and cheaper to make the <num value="3">three</num> deposit banks the special receivers and custodians of the revenue, as it should be paid in by the collecting officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>The <rs>Capitol</rs> is not fireproof; and if I had directed the revenue to be received and retained by the <rs>Treasurer</rs> until it was needed, it would have been necessary to employ an additional clerk, at a salary of perhaps <measure n="2500dollars" type="currency">$2,500</measure> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>This course, if adopted, would have thrown a heavy responsibility upon the <rs>Treasurer</rs>, and would not have been safer or more convenient than the present mode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>The revenue collected since the suspension is on special deposit in the banks, and is to be drawn on special checks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>I trust his arrangement will meet with your approbation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/> After the suspension of specie payments, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> important question to be considered was, how are the specie funds to be provided for the payment of the <rs>State</rs> interest and the redemption of her debt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>After serious reflection, I decided that the only fair and proper mode was to ascertain what percentage upon the circulation of all the banks in the <rs>State</rs>, on the <dateStruct value="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> last (the date of the latest quarterly return of their condition), would realize the necessary amount, and thus save the credit of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>I ascertained that it would require <num value="0.17">seventeen per centum</num>; and I then directed the <rs>Treasurer</rs> and Auditor of Public Accounts to prepare a circular, to be sent the banks, calling upon them to furnish the quota necessary &#x0022;to meet the obligations of the <rs>State</rs>.&#x0022; Shortly thereafter replies were received from <num value="2">two</num> of the banks, protesting against the arrangement, and insisting that it was the duty of the deposit banks to furnish all the specie required for these objects, but at the same time expressing a willing-ness to aid in saving the credit of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>After these letters were received, I caused a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> circular to be sent to the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Both of the circulars are herewith transmitted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/> On the <date value="12-22">22d day of December</date>last a Convention, consisting of officers of the <orgName n="Valley Bank" type="bank">Valley Bank</orgName>, the <name>Merchants</name>' and Mechanics' Bank, the <orgName n="Northwestern Bank" type="bank">Northwestern Bank</orgName>, and the branches of each, the <orgName n="Central Bank" type="bank">Central Bank</orgName>, the <orgName n="Monticello Bank" type="bank">Monticello Bank</orgName>, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> of the <rs>State</rs> stock banks, assembled in this city; and after spending some time in the discussion and consideration of the subject, delivered to me a paper, herewith transmitted for your consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>On the next day a committee, appointed by the <rs>Convention</rs>, waited upon me, and we had a conference of several hours in regard to the plan I had adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>The objections to the plan, as stated in the conversation, were very much those that are embodied in the paper to which I have referred, and are set forth in <num value="3">three</num> of their resolutions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolution sets forth a principle which meets with my cordial approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>I utterly dissent from the principles avowed and the doctrines asserted in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> resolutions, and which are in my opinion in direct conflict with the principle asserted in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>The policy recommended by the <rs>Convention</rs> would result in placing the burden of providing for the <rs>State</rs> interest and the redemption of the debt, almost entirely upon the deposit banks, and to that extent embarrass the mercantile, commercial, mechanical and manufacturing interests of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>The banks as well as the citizens are bound by every consideration of duty, to aid in preserving the credit of the <rs>State</rs>, and the burden ought to be made to bear, as near equally as possible, upon all. A policy which imposes that burden upon <num value="1">one</num> city in the <rs>State</rs>, is in my judgment unjust, and I therefore declined to recognize it. Nor did I approve of the discrimination which this resolution proposed to make between <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> bondholders and others &mdash; in the first place because it was unjust to our own citizens, and in the second place, because such a discrimination, if sanctioned, was to be regarded as a declaration of inability on the part of the <rs>State</rs> to meet her engagements, and must have injuriously affected he credit abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>The preservation of the <rs>State</rs>'s credit is at all times an object of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>It is especially important that she shall maintain her credit now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> resolution demands &#x0022;a uniform percentage upon the aggregate amount of the capital, circulation and deposits of all the banks of the <placeName reg="Commonwealth river">Commonwealth</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> last, excluding the <rs>State</rs>'s deposits.&#x0022; A single illustration will be sufficient to demonstrate the injustice of this plan, as well as its impracticability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>The <orgName n="Richmond Bank" type="bank">Bank of Richmond</orgName> was chartered at the last session, with a capital of not less than <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">one hundred thousand dollars</measure> and not more than <num value="1000000">one million</num>.--When the minimum capital was subscribed and the bank was organized, they applied for an issue of notes to the amount of <measure n="20000dollars" type="currency">twenty thousand dollars</measure>, having <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of that amount of <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">five thousand dollars</measure> in specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>According to the views embodied in this resolution, I would have been required to assess, in this instance <num value="0.17">seventeen per cent</num> upon <measure n="120000dollars" type="currency">one hundred and twenty thousand dollars</measure>, when the bank never had a circulation, exceeding <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Does not this illustration clearly demonstrate the injustice of the rule laid down by the <rs>Convention</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>I could not therefore recognize either the justice or the policy of this recommendation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/> Our banking system needs reformation in several respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>We have <num value="2">two</num> competing systems of backing to the state; and I have abundant reason to know that jealousy and distrust exist between them to a serious extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>When the late bank convention was help in this city, the <orgName n="Virginia Bank" type="bank">Virginia Bank</orgName>, the <orgName n="Farmers Bank" type="bank">Farmers' Bank</orgName> and the <orgName n="Exchange Bank" type="bank">Exchange Bank</orgName> were not invited to participate in the discussion and consideration of the important questions which had called the <rs>Convention</rs> together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>When I proposed to the committee who waited upon me, that I would invite the officers of those institutions to meet and confer with them the reply was, &#x0022;that the <rs>Convention</rs> and adjourned, and they had no power to alter the policy fixed upon by that body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>My object in presenting this fact, is to demonstrate the existence of a feeling of jealousy and hostility, which I regard as decidedly unfavorable to harmonious action in our monetary system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>In <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> my predecessor, in all message to the <name>Legislature</name>, in referring to the existence of this feeling, used this distinct and emphatic language: &#x0022;They are competing with each other, and their collisions and jealousies are not the best influences to case the difficulties of the times.--Without drawing any invidious comparison between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>I urge merely the fact that the existence of the <num value="2">two</num> is not most favorable to the harmony of our money system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Which was the best or worst, either alone would be better, in my opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>Than the <num value="2">two</num> with an antagonism between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Antagonism exists, and will exist.&#x0022; My experience and observation, since the suspension of specie payments, confirms fully the accuracy of this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>Why this is so, I am not prepared to say, nor shall I undertake to determine, who is to blame for the existence of this state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>It is certainly prejudicial to the interests of the <rs>State</rs>, and ought to be corrected, if it can be done, by legislation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/> It affords me great satisfaction to believe that all our banks are in a sound condition, and that they are responsible and reliable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>In times of financial embarrassment and pressure, such as we are now passing through, it becomes us to practice as much forbearance as possible in our business intercourse <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> and arrangements, that the evil may not be unnecessarily aggravated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Confidence has been shaken to a great extent, but this was to have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>It is a plant of slow growth, and charity forbearance and prudence is required to prevent it from being uprooted and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>In communities where the credit system prevails to so great an extent as it does here, we must be cautious, or we will involve all in a common ruin. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/> Several reforms are necessary, in my opinion, in our system of banking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>We ought to abolish all notes of a less denomination than <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure>; but this should be done by degrees, and with the utmost caution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>It is a reform that will require time to accomplish; but as it is a necessary reform, our attention should be directed to it, and it should be provided for in the renewal of the charters of the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Its effect will be to infuse a larger amount of specie into our circulation, and to protect those in the community who, from their want of familiarity with bank paper, are most liable to be imposed upon by counterfeit paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>From <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>, a period of <measure n="22years" type="date">twenty-two years</measure>, the <num value="1">one</num> and <measure n="2l." type="pounds"><num value="2">two</num> pound</measure> notes of the <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName> were allowed to circulate, and according to the returns made to Parliament, it is ascertained that the number of prosecutions for counterfeiting or passing counterfeit notes of the <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName>, were <num value="998">998</num>, and of that number, there were <num value="313">313</num> capital convictions, <num value="530">530</num> inferior convictions, and <num value="155">155</num> acquittals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>The enormous sum of &#x00A3;<num value="249000">249,000</num> (near a <num value="1000000.25">million and a quarter</num> of dollars) was expended by the bank in attending to these prosecutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>The returns show that by far the greater proportion of these prosecutions were connected with the <num value="1">one</num> and <measure n="2l." type="pounds"><num value="2">two</num> pound</measure> notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The detections at the bank, for a period of a little more than <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, from the <date value="1812-01-01">1st day of January, 1812,</date> to <date value="1818-04-10">April 10th, 1818,</date> were of <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> pound notes, <num value="107238">107,238</num>; of <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> pound notes, <num value="17787">17,787</num>; of <hi rend="italics"><num value="5">five</num></hi> pound notes, <num value="5826">5,826</num>; of <hi rend="italics"><num value="10">ten</num></hi> pound notes, <num value="419">419</num>; of <hi rend="italics"><num value="20">twenty</num></hi> pound notes, <num value="54">54</num>; and of all above <hi rend="italics"><num value="20">twenty</num></hi> pounds, <num value="35">35</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>This covers only <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> out of the <num value="22">twenty-two</num>; but it shows a frightful exhibition of crime connected with the small notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>A reference to any reliable counterfeit detector will show that the editions of counterfeits in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, of local and State banks, of <hi rend="italics"><num value="10">ten</num></hi> dollars and under, are more than <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num> of the editions of <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> and upwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>These striking facts are extracted from a speech made some years ago, by <num value="1">one</num> of our best informed statesmen and they well deserve to be pondered in your consideration of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>If you shall come to the conclusion that no notes of a less denomination than <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> should be issued by the banks, you will of course prohibit the circulation of notes of other States, of a less denomination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num></hi>--A custom prevails throughout <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, in perhaps all the banks, by which their loans are confined, to a great extent, to those persons who can offer drafts on northern cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>This policy is, in my opinion, not only unjust to the community, but it is unsafe to the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>So long as the specie of our banks is kept in New York, or other northern cities, to be drawn on in favor of the holders of their notes, we are perfectly at the mercy of those banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>If from any cause they suspend specie payments, we are necessarily compelled to suspend also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>This was the case in <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>Each bank should be the custodian of its own funds; but while this policy prevails it cannot be. We need a greater specie circulation; but this we can never have so long as the vaults of our banks contain little else than bills and notes <unclear>discounted</unclear>, most of which are payable out of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>From such bills and notes very little <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> is brought into the <rs>State</rs>: And besides, the bank which pursues this policy, from the nature of the case, must have a very limited knowledge of the pecuniary condition and responsibility of the acceptor of the draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>Would it not be safer and better to employ their means in discounting the paper of these who are personally known to them as the maker and endorsers of the note, and of whose ability to meet it at maturity they are fully advised? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>There is another objection to this policy, which I will illustrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>An individual borrows say <measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">$2,000</measure> from <num value="1">one</num> of our banks, payable in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>After his note has been discounted, the banks suspend specie payments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>When the note matures, he must procure exchange from the bank that made the loan, or he must go to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> with the notes perhaps of that bank, and pass them to a broker at a loss of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="0.03">three per cent</num>, to procure <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> funds to take up his note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>This surely is neither just nor right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>I recommend, therefore, that this policy be prohibited by law, or, at least, that the party be allowed to redeem his obligation by requiring the bank to receive its own notes in payment in all cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>This policy places an onerous burden upon the borrower, which is unjust in the extreme, and it ought not to be permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>If A holds my note, and I hold a note of equal amount against A, The law authorizes me to set off A's demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>Why should it not be to with the banks? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num></hi>--I would prohibit he banks from dealing in exchange, and would require them to furnish it, not at par, but at what it cost them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>The rate of exchange between <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and New York in ordinary times, when the banks are paying specie, seldom ranges above the half of <num value="0.01">one per cent.</num>, which is about the cost of transporting specie between the <num value="2">two</num> points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>If the banks were denied the privilege of dealing in exchange and realizing a profit, it would take from them the temptation to confine their loans to those who pay in northern drafts, and their accommodations would be diffused more generally amongst our own citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Our banking capital would thus be used for the accommodation of our own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>As it now is, much of it is used for the benefit and advantage of citizens of the northern cities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/> <hi rend="italics">Lastly</hi>--If the policy of discounting northern drafts is to be continued, I recommend that it shall be restricted to such drafts as have only a short time to run, say <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>. Many of the northern drafts that the banks are in the habit of discounting, if I have been correctly informed run from <num value="4">four</num> to <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. This is extending southern credit to the northern agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>He is using the funds of southern banks for his own advantage, at the expense and injury of our own citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>Our banks were created for the benefit and convenience of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>If the northern agent wishes to purchase out tobacco, or any other article we have for sale let him come prepared to pay for it. Change a policy which thus makes the south tributary to the north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>No policy, financial or other, should be encouraged to strengthen and build up the business of the north, under present circumstances, at our expense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/> I recommend a divorce of the <rs>State</rs> from the banks; and in making this recommendation, I desire to be understood as striking no blow at those institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>It is a measure demanded alike by wisdom and prudence, and the interests both of the <rs>State</rs> and the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>I can conceive of no system which is so well calculated to restrain the banks from excessive issues, and to confine them within prudent and safe limits, and which at the same time will tend to the enlargement of the specie circulation of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>Where there is a demand, there will necessarily be a supply in any article that may be required for the comfort the convenience or the business interests of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>The amount collected by the various State governments (and mainly in bank paper) is about the sum of <measure n="50000000dollars" type="currency">$50,000,000</measure> annually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>Our revenue amounts to about <measure n="3938000dollars" type="currency">$3,938,000</measure>, in round numbers, and if collected in specie, it is plain to the commonest understanding, that it would exert a powerful influence in restraining over issues by the banks, and thus prevent over trading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>It would prevent the deposit banks from discounting on the faith of the revenue, collected by the <rs>State</rs>, in the notes of her various banks and which are on deposit in their vaults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>This stimulant to overtrading being withdrawn, we would have a healthier and a more uniform circulation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>The adoption of this policy would result in retaining in our State a sufficient amount of specie not only for the purposes of the government, but in a time of bank suspensions, would furnish sufficient specie for the ordinary transactions of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>The divorce is demanded by principle and policy, The connection involves the <rs>State</rs> as a partner in the misfortunes of the banks; and whenever the law is violated, by the suspension of specie payments the fact that the <rs>State</rs> is a stockholder, induces the <name>Legislature</name> to look upon the act more favorably than would be the case, perhaps, if she held no interest in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>Whatever is calculated to impair or destroy independence in legislation, must sooner or later exert an injurious influence upon the public interests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/> Entertaining very decided convictions on this subject, I felt it to be my duty, in the canvass which preceded my election, to avow my opinions freely and frankly, and to declare my purpose to recommend the adoption of the independent treasury system to the consideration of the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>The recent suspension of specie payments (a result I did not then anticipate,) and the difficulties that have attended the arrangements for the payment of the <rs>State</rs>'s semi-annual interest, growing out of the hostility existing between our <num value="2">two</num> systems of banking, shows, in my judgment, the necessity for adopting this policy at as early a day as practicable, consistently with a due regard to the interests of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, arising from her ownership of stock in the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>So long as the connection between the <rs>State</rs> and the banks exists, those banks, which receive no portion of the <rs>State</rs> revenue, will complain of the preference which has been given to the <num value="3">three</num> banks in this city, as prejudicial and injurious to them, and will always protest against any demand that may be made upon them by the <rs>State</rs>, beyond the redemption of so much of their paper as is received in payment of revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>As between the systems, we should not exhibit a preference for <num value="1">one</num> over the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>Let the <rs>State</rs> manage her own affairs in her own way, and leave the banks to manage theirs, subject only to the requirements of the law. The divorce of the <rs>State</rs> from the banks will remove <num value="1">one</num> ground of jealousy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>Let the <num value="2">two</num> systems demonstrate their relative advantages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/> Against this policy many objections are urged &mdash; some of the more prominent of which I propose to notice briefly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>Most of these are the same objections which were urged against the adoption of the independent treasury system by the <rs>Federal</rs> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>When this great measure was proposed in Congress, its opponents were fully satisfied that the effect of such a policy would be rumours, and serious apprehensions were felt and expressed by the timid of its friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>The measure was pressed, adopted, and after an experience of years, very few would be willing to return to the old system, and revive it as the settled policy of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>I can see no reason why the adoption of alike policy by the <rs>State</rs> would not operate equally as well, and produce results equally as satisfactory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objection is, that it would operate oppressively upon the people, in this &mdash; that they could not procure specie enough to pay their taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>The same objection was urged when the system was proposed to be adopted by the <rs>Federal</rs> government; but the result has proved in that case that it was unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>So I think it would be in this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>In <num value="4">four</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of the <name>States</name> the taxes are now paid in notes of the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>These notes upon their face profess to be the representatives of specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>If this be true, then there would be no difficulty in converting them, and the specie thus obtained would be used in the payment of the taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>If they are not convertible, the people, the most of whom are interested in banking upon sound principles only, should know the fact, and neither they nor the <rs>State</rs> should receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>We want a sound paper currency &mdash; a currency that is convertible into specie &mdash; and if our present currency is not convertible at the will of the holder, it ought to be made so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> objection is, that we have not specie enough in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to carry this policy into operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>The wisest statesmen of the nation have for more than <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> felt the necessity of infusing into the circulation of the country a larger amount of specie, and to this end they have been shaping the legislation of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>They have abundant reason to be gratified with the success that has attended their efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>In <date value="1833-10">October, 1833,</date> we had in specie, in active circulation, <measure n="4000000dollars" type="currency">$4,000,000</measure>, and in the banks in specie, <measure n="25000000dollars" type="currency">$25,000,000</measure>; on the <date value="1834-01-01">1st day of January, 1834,</date> <measure n="12000000dollars" type="currency">$12,000,000</measure> in active circulation, and <measure n="27000000dollars" type="currency">$27,000,000</measure> in the banks; on the <date value="1835-01-01">1st day of January, 1835,</date> <measure n="18000000dollars" type="currency">$18,000,000</measure> in active circulation, and in the banks <measure n="43000000dollars" type="currency">$43,000,000</measure>; on the <date value="1836-01-01">1st day of January, 1836,</date> <measure n="23000000dollars" type="currency">$23,000,000</measure> in active circulation, and in the banks <measure n="40000000dollars" type="currency">$40,000,000</measure>; and on the <date value="1836-12-01">1st day of December, 1836,</date> <measure n="28000000dollars" type="currency">$28,000,000</measure> in active circulation, and in the banks, <measure n="45000000dollars" type="currency">$45,000,000</measure>. These are the results of the policy inaugurated by those statesmen, who were ridiculed and stigmatized at that day as &#x0022;hard money men;&#x0022; and they are valuable practical results, reflecting the highest credit upon their sagacity and statesmanship, and producing the best effects upon the business and interests of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>I come down to a later period, and present the results as they exhibit themselves to us. Since the discovery of gold in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, more than <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure> have been added from that source to the gold of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>It was estimated that we had in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, at that time, <measure n="120000000dollars" type="currency">$120,000,000</measure> in specie, showing an increase between <dateStruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, of <measure n="47000000dollars" type="currency">$47,000,000</measure>. In <date value="1857-12">December, 1857,</date> it was estimated that there was at least <measure n="290000000dollars" type="currency">$290,000,000</measure> in specie <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure> of which were in the banks, and <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> in active circulation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/> In our own State, according to the quarterly returns made by the banks to this department, of their condition on the <dateStruct value="-09-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> last, their capital amounts to <measure n="16565510dollars" type="currency">$16,565,510</measure>; their circulation, <measure n="9806837.83dollars" type="currency">$9,806,837.83</measure>; their deposits, <measure n="6699283.60dollars" type="currency">$6,699,283.60</measure>; their discounts, <measure n="2553239dollars" type="currency">$25,532,39</measure> <unclear>.<num value="67">67</num>;</unclear> and their specie, <measure n="2804930dollars" type="currency">$2,804,930</measure>.<unclear><num value="9">9</num>.</unclear> Thus it is seen that we have a circulation of near <num value="10000000">ten millions</num>, upon a banking capital of more than <num value="16000000.5">sixteen millions and a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>The question that presents itself in this connection is, do the <num value="5">five</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="20">twenty</num>, <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="50">fifty</num> and <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollar</measure> notes, now in circulation, represent specie?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>Upon their face, they purport to be convertible into specie, at the will of the holder; and it would be regarded as an attack upon the solvency of the banks which had issued them, to say they were not convertible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/> We thus have within a traction of <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> in the circulation of the banks, besides the specie in active circulation in the <rs>State</rs>, which must be several <num value="1000000">millions</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>Can it be possible with these facts before us, that the revenue of the <rs>State</rs> cannot be collected in specie?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>If there shall be doubt on the subject, let the law prescribe that <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> shall be collected in specie the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="0.5">one half</num> the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, and the whole amount the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>This will afford the people ample time to provide for the change in the system of collecting the revenue of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/> In <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> the banks held <measure n="13000000dollars" type="currency">$13,000,000</measure> in specie, upon which they issued a circulation of <measure n="114743414dollars" type="currency">$114,743,414</measure>.--In <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> they had <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure> in specie upon which they issued a circulation of <measure n="214778822dollars" type="currency">$214,778,822</measure>. Thus it will be seen that in a period of <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> the banks increased their specie only <measure n="17000000dollars" type="currency">$17,000,000</measure>, while their circulation was increased more than <measure n="100000000dollars" type="currency">$100,000,000</measure> in the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>Could such a result have occurred, if the operations of the various State governments had been conducted upon the principle, for which I contend viz: the independent treasury system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>It requires no prophet to foretell the end of a system which exhibits such startling results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/> Another objection urged is, that the system is not safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Why not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>Cannot the treasurer of the <rs>State</rs> be as safety entrusted with the keeping and disbursement of the public money as the officers of the banks?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>They are all respectable gentlemen; and is there reason to suppose that an officer of the <rs>State</rs> is less trustworthy than an officer of the bank?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Experience, however, is the safest guide in all such cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Has not the experiment worked well under the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; and if it has, have we reason to suppose that the officers of our State government would be less honest, less prompt, or less faithful in executing the law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>I trust not. </p>
