<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> The <orgName n="New York Daily News" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Daily News</hi></orgName> administers a caustic rebuke to those Southern refugees who crowd hotels in New York, and probably elsewhere, and make themselves conspicuous by their ardent word valor in behalf of the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The <hi rend="italics">News</hi> observes that they are, in general, able bodied men, and thinks they could give a better proof of their devotion to Dixie by fighting her battles than talking in New York hotels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>If they have taken refuge in the <rs>North</rs> from fear, it thinks they would exhibit better taste to remain silent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> The censure of the <hi rend="italics">News</hi> is well deserved, and applies to a class of people for whom very little respect is entertained in either country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>During the panic which prevailed in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> at the prospect of an invasion by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, some of the wealthiest and noblest persons in that country sold out their possessions and bought property in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with a view of making that their place of refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Such shameful desertion of their native land, in her hour of need, called forth the indignant denunciations of the <rs>British</rs> press, and has not been forgotten to this day. We never heard, however, that any of them sought refuge in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the enemy of their, country, and, compromised with their conscience by spouting <persName n="Bullism,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="default:Bullism,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bullism</surname></persName> in <name>French</name> coffee-rooms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> If it were disgraceful for <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> to forsake their country at a period of merely apprehended danger &mdash; a danger which was never realized &mdash; what must be thought of those who go abroad, either to the <rs>North</rs> or <rs>Europe</rs> and leave a land struggling, like this, <unclear>amid</unclear> the existing and appalling realities of the most fearful contest ever waged on this continent?--What must be thought of able-bodied men who leave old men and children to fight their battles and defend their property whilst they are luxuriating in the ease and security of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and showing their patriotism by disgusting laudations of the courage and self-sacrifice of their brave countrymen?--qualities which they take excellent care never to imitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We advise them to keep silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Let them carry that discretion, which is the better part of valor, into their tongues as well as their legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/><rs n="European" type="group">Europeans</rs> understand them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>When an oppressed <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nation rises in arms, it is the custom of its exiles residing in other parts of the world to rush home to the assistance of their fatherland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>When people rush from their country at the moment she most requires their services, they may make sure of the universal contempt of all mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> We believe that even the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> entertain at this moment more respect for those Confederates who are fighting, suffering and dying for their homes and firesides than the loud-talking and fugacious patriots who have deserted their country in the hour of her extremity and betaken themselves to the <rs>North</rs> or to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>When a man goes bodily to the enemy, we call it desertion and punish it as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>But open desertion is more manly, because it is more perilous and free from hypocrisy than a miserable sneaking out of the contest by the back door under the various contemptible pretexts and pretences which are so often set up for running the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>This act has all the meanness of desertion without its candor and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We make no allusions, of course, to agents of the <rs>Government</rs> sent abroad to conduct official business, nor to such as go abroad for a short time in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>But there are others, and, we blush to say, not a few, who are making themselves conspicuous in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by their loquacious patriotism, who are neither more nor less than hypocritical deserters from the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> A correspondent of the <orgName n="Wilmington Journal" type="newspaper">Wilmington <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName> gives an interesting account of the recent chase of the <rs>Tallahassee</rs>, going into that port, by the <rs>Federal</rs> blockaders.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> When matters <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> became interesting, the <rs>Tallahassee</rs> was steering E. N. E., with the <rs>Lilian</rs> forward of the starboard beam, distant about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, and edging down to cut us off; the fellow with square sails was nearly abeam, with about the same distance between us.--The <rs>Montgomery</rs>, a <num value="3">three</num>-masted propeller, was on the starboard quarter, and distant about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>. The <rs>Tallahassee</rs> had about <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of steam; and it was evident she was not gaining on the <rs>Lilian</rs>, which vessel was then to be feared, as she was getting in our track; and still another vessel appeared about this time on the port bow. In trim, with plenty of steam, the gallant racer would have dashed between them like a dolphin, but unfortunately the cleaning and repairs had taken more time than was expected, and in consequence steam was down, and <measure n="9days" type="date">nine days</measure> consumption of fuel had so lightened the vessel that her screws were not perfectly submerged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Under these disadvantages she came to the score, pressed by <num value="3">three</num> cruisers, chosen, no doubt, for the present service on account of their speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>As I have before remarked, the <rs>Lilian</rs> was holding on like a beagle and forging ahead to block the way to seaward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Circumstanced as we were, there was but <num value="1">one</num> thing to do &mdash; wear round and head to the northward and westward, thus making a stern chase for the <rs>Lilian</rs>, and bringing, as our immediate competitor, the <rs>Montgomery</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It should be born in mind that the land lay to northward and westward, distant not more than <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>, which prevented us from bearing up in a line perpendicular to that of the squadron in chase, and compelled us to steer nearly parallel with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>In our reversed position, the <rs>Montgomery</rs> was brought on the port bow and, immediately edged down on our quarter to get in range, when she opened, making very excellent practice; scarcely a shot fell out of line; several passed over between the masts, and <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> fell but a few yards short, making a slight <hi rend="italics">ricochet.</hi> All of her shell were defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> We refrained from firing for some time, in order to conceal the character of the vessel; but believing that we were known, the order was given to uncover the after gun, set the colors and pennant, and return shot for shot.
