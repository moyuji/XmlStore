<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Owing to the alarming reports of the night before, rumors that Southern troops were approaching, we found crowds at every stopping place, who cheered the trains as they passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The report of the advance of Southern troops had been received the night before, and a <num value="100">hundred</num> riflemen had been under arms, guarding the town all night afar at this time men with rifles on their shoulders were coming in from all directions, word having been sent out the night before. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They had heard, however, that a train was coming from the <rs>West</rs>, and as this was unusual since the burning of the bridges, a considerable crowd was at the depot waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>As the trains rolled in they displayed the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag amidst the greatest enthusiasm. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These men all seemed to expect nothing short of execution on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The trains soon after moved on down the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> burned bridge, where the men disembarked and paraded in a meadow <persName n="Kelley,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Kelley</surname></persName> then <unclear>de ed</unclear> <num value="6">six</num> companies and started for <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName>, some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> below, from which, it was said, the men who burnt the bridge had come, and where it was reported some <num value="50">fifty</num> armed secession troops were stationed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Meanwhile, the remainder of the troops stacked arms, after throwing out pickets and scouts on the neighboring hills, with orders to bring in any persons they might find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In less than <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> after their arrival they brought in <num value="6">six</num>, some of whom, it was positively asserted by some Union men from the country around, were accessory to the destruction of the bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Squads of men continued to go out in different directions, and to bring in prisoners until they must have had, at least, a dozen under guard at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Several of them were released after an examination by the officers, but at least <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> were retained until the return of <persName n="Kelley,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Kelley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>As certainly as they would spy a man anywhere in sight, a squad of them would seize their guns and start after him on a run, and before very long would bring him the for they were sure of their game if they got eyes on it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> In the evening the companies returned from <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName>, bringing with them several prisoners, and reporting that their scouts had <measure n="1" type="killed">killed one</measure> secessionist and wounded another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>When they got to <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName> they found it utmost entirely deserted, the secessionists having got wind of their approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Finding the town deserted, <persName n="Kelley,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Kelley</surname></persName> ordered his men to scout the woods surrounding it, and it was not long till they had unearthed several of the fugitives, most of whom they captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The men who were shot were running from their pursuers, who called out to them to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Not heading this, they were told they would be shot unless they did. No attention was paid to the command, and several shots were fired, killing <num value="1">one</num> instantly and wounding another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> I have not learned at this writing what was done with the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The impression in <unclear>ce</unclear> was that they would be tried by a court-in-arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Against some of them there is very strong positive evidence that they set fire to the bridges. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Time should be taken to drill our forces, and to drill them well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>They learn aptly and rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>They will make good regulars in as many weeks as commoner material requires months for the operation.--We enjoy peculiar advantages in the possession of drill officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>The admirable volunteer companies of our Southern cities have also proved an excellent military school, and have furnished numerous tactical instructors to our new levies of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>With so many advantages for hastening and perfecting the instruction of our troops in the drill and the manual exercises, it would be very unwise &mdash; it would be almost criminal &mdash; to disregard these advantages and rush our forces unprepared into the face of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the most important arms of the peculiar service that will be required in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and that which we can multiply to any extent whatever, is that of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>But it takes time to convert a company of horse into a troops of dragoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>A thoroughly trained troop of dragoons will run down and cut to pieces <num value="8">eight</num> times their number of ordinary cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The efficiency of no service is so much augmented by drill as that of cavalry.--It is not only the man who is to be trained, but the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It is not only quickness and skill in man&#x0153;uvre that is to be learnt by man and beast, but the important matter of expertness in the broad sword exercise that is to be acquired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The broad sword is the peculiar weapon of the dragoon, as the bayonet is that of the foot soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Pistols and carbines only prove encumbrances in the real encounter for which military science designs the dragoon.--The percussion given by the weight and swiftness of the animal, and the terrible execution committed by the broad sword in the hands of men trained to use it, and to keep their saddles under any shock &mdash; these are the true uses of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>It requires much more time and drill to make a dragoon than to make a foot soldier, and every day gained by our numerous <orgName n="Cavalry Corps" type="corps">cavalry corps</orgName> for the drill may save hundreds of soldiers to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> It is true that men on horseback, companies of mounted men, armed with pistols and double- barrel guns, loaded with the wire buckshot cartridge, constitute a formidable arm of defence, and even of assault; but these are valuable as men on horseback, not as dragoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>They may, in superior numbers, successfully resist charges of dragoons, by firing into them at a little distance, disorganizing their line, and breaking the shock of their charge; but in the charge itself they cannot cope with the dragoon and the broad sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>The rangers are invaluable skirmishers; but in the battle itself, then the dragoon is worth more than many rangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>The case is precisely analogous to that of the rifle corps and the regular infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>The rifle will do well at a distance, but when it comes to the charge the rifle is hopelessly useless against the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>By all means let our regular cavalry be well drilled in the use of the broad sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Let us have a few regiments of dragoons sufficiently well trained to hold their own, and more than hold it, against any dragoons of the regular service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Let them not be precipitated upon regular forces too hastily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Their lives are too precious not to be guarded by so plain a precaution as thorough drilling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>When this grave object is sought and diligently striven for, <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">festina levte</hi></foreign> is an excellent motto for a careful General. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/> But while these obvious considerations require precaution against too hastily precipitating our main forces into conflict, the same reasons do not prevent our guerilla forces from threatening the enemy on every side, and in every annoying manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The Constitution which once united these sovereign States, neither knew a Northern nor a Southern section of this great country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>It only knew its creators, the sovereign States, to be equal and supreme in their political co-partnership, associated together for the specific purposes of common defence and external protection.--This magnificent temple of human liberty was established and cemented by the precious blood of revolutionary sires, who were as well <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> as <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs>, <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, Poles, and <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Those great principles of self-government, constitutional freedom, and State sovereignty, upon which alone the individual liberty of man could have been perpetuated, have been gradually overturned by the selfish and unprincipled agency of Northern politicians, who, for their own purposes have inaugurated a false policy, utterly adverse to the principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and tending directly to the consolidation of all power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; thus establishing a despotism precisely similar to those of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, which we had so indignantly abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>During the engagement several men were seen to fall on the steamers, and it is generally believed that at least <num value="1">one</num> of the vessels was badly injured, as all of them withdrew from the fight about <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>The men in the battery sustained no injury, the only damage done being the tearing to pieces of the officers' quarters by a shell from the enemy's gun. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Our battery fired <num value="100">100</num> shots, many of which took effect on the vessels, <num value="1">one</num> of them carrying away the flag of the <rs>Anacosta</rs>, and another cutting down the mast of the large propeller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>If this liberality --this suicidal looseness of management &mdash; is to continue, the consequences may be serious, before we are aware of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, however, with a little rest, some help and some damage from the doctors, I have been enabled to recruit my exhausted energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>The time of deliberation has given place to the time of action, and I have taken up my bed, as an individual, in common with others, to march to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, to meet the <rs>President</rs> of our now separate and independent Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>I am ready to obey his orders, not only with pride, pleasure, and devotion to the cause, and respect to the office he fills, but with respect and devotion to the man himself, as <num value="1">one</num> who has our fullest confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>(Applause.) You have to meet a foe with whom you could not live in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>The political power and rights which were enthroned in their <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">Capitol</placeName>, when you were united with them under the old constitutional bond of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have been annihilated.--They have undertaken to annul laws within your limits which would render your own property unsafe within those limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>They have abolitionized your border, as the disgraced <rs>North</rs> west will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>They have invaded your moral strongholds and the rites of your religion, and undertaken to teach you what should be the moral duties of men.--They have invaded the sanctity of your homes and firesides, and endeavored to play master, <rs type="role" n="Father">father</rs>, and husband for you in your households &mdash; in a word, have set themselves up as a petty <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, by which you were in all things to be guided and controlled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>(A Voice--<q>&#x0022;That's so.&#x0022;</q>) But you have already declared that you would not be subject to this invasion of your rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The call is for action, and I rejoice that it has met such a response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Who is there that now dares to put on the face of sanctity to deprecate war, or the horrid glories of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>None! Why? Because it is a war of purification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>If you can do no better, go to a blacksmith, take a gun along as a sample, and have him make you <num value="1">one</num> like it; get a spear, a lance &mdash; take a lesson from <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00292" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>; manufacture your blades from old iron, even though they be the tires of your cart wheels; get a bit of a spring, grind and burnish it into the shape of a <measure n="2inch" type="distance">two-inch</measure> blade bowie-knife; put to it any sort of a handle, so that it be strong-ash, hickory or oak--[A voice, <q>&#x0022;Take your poker and tongs!&#x0022;</q>] --and if possible get a double-barreled gun, and a dozen rounds of buck-shot, and go upon the battle-field with these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Fortunately, however, the time has come when the people of this State need neither the aid of argument nor of exiting appeal.--The time has arrived when they are satisfied that the deliverance of this fair State depends not upon argument, not upon eloquence, not upon statesmanship, but upon the fighting manhood of the people of this country --Cheers.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>An idea of the character of their offences may be found in the following, which is reliable: Shortly after their arrival at Newports News, a number of the soldiery &mdash; some in a beastly state of intoxication &mdash; went to the residence of a highly respectable farmer in the neighborhood, and drove the whole family from the house with out a moment's notice, who were compelled to seek the woods for safety.

<p>
