<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The <rs type="place">Spring</rs> Elections are upon us again, and affording once more that healthful, bracing stimulant which, even in the midst of war, our <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo-Saxon</rs> constitutions require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A Spring Election is an indispensable tonic to the stomachs of Southern freemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>From time immemorial we have found it as useful before summer as a mint-julep before breakfast in those days when mint, ice, loaf sugar and whiskey existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The precious compound, which sent joy to so many hearts and ruin to so many hearthstones, is a thing of the past; but the <rs type="place">Spring</rs> Elections remain, and, in the midst of battle and bloodshed, retain their potent fascinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Political campaigns are now rivalling the interest of military campaigns; there is generalship in politics as well as in fighting; there are flank movements, ambuscades, mining and counter mining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The great difference is, that he who runs fastest wins the laurels in <num value="1">one</num> case, and loses them in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The fastest pair of legs is the desideratum among politicians; whereas, in the service, legs are held in light esteem except among cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> We have no wish to discourage the ancient, national amusement of Spring Elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We admire the tenacious ardor and vitality of the passion to vote and be voted for. Scarcely has a huge cavalry raid swept over the country, and apparently stripped it of every living thing, before there spring up in its track, green and imperishable, political candidates and their supporters, who pitch into each other with a patriotism and vim that, if combined in a physical demonstration against the enemy, would sweep him from the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Whatever else the raids of <orgName><persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName> destroy, they cannot extinguish the inevitable sparring for legislative honors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> We suggest to the enemy that the coolness and system with which our people are now going about this work do not look much like the deportment of men who are in daily expectation of being subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We have none of us the most remote idea of permitting them to deprive us of our favorite pastime of voting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We intend to go ahead, in Old Virginia, voting for our own rulers, or servants, as they modestly style themselves, for the next <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, <orgName><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName> to the contrary notwithstanding. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> A great deal of superfluous enthusiasm is wasted by the <rs>Northern</rs> newspaper correspondents over the fine qualities and attributes of the negro race as it is found at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>All the complimentary things they say of these <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> afford us no new ideas, and, if their object is to irritate and provoke, fall far short of the mark.--These creatures were brought here barbarians; such as they are now, they have become under the mild and refining influence of Southern servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Whilst the <rs>Northern</rs> <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs>, according to the confession of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune's</hi></orgName> <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName> correspondent, is inferior to the <rs>Southern</rs> <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs>; whilst, under the influence of freedom, he has become demoralized and impoverished, and is gradually relapsing to primitive barbarism; here, under the influence of slavery, he has ascended in the scale of civilization and Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There has never been that intense contempt of the negro in the <rs>South</rs> which everywhere in the <rs>North</rs> finds expression in coarse ridicule of his color and physical conformation. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> He has always had our sympathies, as well as shared our bread, and there is even a tie of affection and confidence between the white and <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> members of Southern households which is not to be found either in the <rs>North</rs>, or in the relations of employer and laborer in any other part of the world.
