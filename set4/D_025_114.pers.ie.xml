<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>If they are successful, the <rs>South</rs> will be overrun, and it may be many years before we can recover from the consequences. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It was, in a word, an elaborate attempt to take an advantage &mdash; a thorough <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> trick &mdash; an exhibition of contempt for good faith when it stood in the way of a low scheme for getting the better in a trade &mdash; a substitution of low cunning for genuine ability &mdash; a mistake of policy common to knaves, who cannot be taught to look beyond their noses or to see that rascality, though successful for the moment, puts an extinguisher upon all future hope of advantage by the distrust which it engenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>A large number of prisoners was taken at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> and paroled by the officer to whom they surrendered, as had always been the practice under the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>They were passed through our lines and into those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It struck <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> that they would be very useful in the battle then raging, and he made them fall into the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>An apology had already been provided for him. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, in view of this very thing, had decided that paroles to be binding must be signed by the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>An honorable man would have scorned to profit by such knavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>But <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> is not an honorable man. He is a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>He took advantage of it, and put the men to work at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It so happened that a very few days after <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> surrendered to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The officer commanding had heard nothing of the new interpretation put upon the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He paroled the prisoners; he was not the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in Chief</rs>; and so by the rascality of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves we recovered a brave army of <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> men. Knavery thus reacted upon itself, and recoiled upon the heads of those who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> set it in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The cunning <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were too &#x0022;smart&#x0022; for themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> The reasons why the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government put an end to the cartel are obvious enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>They believe their own supply of men to be inexhaustible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The degeneration, therefore, of the prisoners they lose can easily be cured by fresh recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>At the same time, they think our means of recruiting are exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Every man they retain, therefore, they regard as a drain to that extent which cannot be made up. They think it is the same thing as killing the like number in the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>At the same time they hope to gain another advantage by leaving their men with us. They think they will assist them in their favorite policy of starving us out. They are mistaken in this, but that is the true interpretation to be put upon their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The whole transaction is genuine <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>--utterly base, as everything originating with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is &mdash; wretchedly short sighted, as knavery always must be &mdash; miserably awkward and bungling, as all things originating in falsehood must be. <persName n="Swift,,Dean,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="default:Swift,Dean,,,"><foreName>Dean</foreName> <surname>Swift</surname></persName> says he never heard more than <num value="3">three</num> well constructed lies in his life, and he was the most acute of observers.--<persName n="Meredith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="mostcommon:Meredith,nomatch:0"><surname>Meredith</surname></persName>'s defences of the rascally conduct of his Government are certainly not among the most ingenious of inventions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> There is no evil out of which good may not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Our troops have been in the habit of surrendering too easily heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The object, in too many instances, has been to get exchanged, and pay a visit to their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Under the present system they will have no chance to see home during the war if they are taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Besides, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are preparing to make their prisoners more unendurable than they have ever been.
