<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Reports from the recent scene of his operations concur in representing the condition of his army as pitiable in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Disease and death had decimated his ranks, and it is stated that large numbers were dying daily from the effect of the climate and the malaria of the adjacent swamps.

<head>Important decision &mdash; foreign residents liable to military duty.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> An important decision affecting foreign residents has been made by <persName n="Lochrane,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lochrane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Lochrane</surname></persName>, of the <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Ga.</placeName>, <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The question arose on a writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus, </hi> brought by an alien to procure his discharge from the <rs>Confederate</rs> service: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> In delivering the opinion of the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, <persName n="Lochrane,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lochrane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Lochrane</surname></persName> denounced unsparingly the pretext of foreign allegiance as an exemption from military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He said, after a review of the doctrines of allegiance held in various countries, that they illustrated nothing that would control Courts here, and that every Government had the power of prescribing and perfecting its own system of granting citizenship; no rule of international law was laid down or adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In view of this fact it was proper to ascertain the law of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> on the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> At the time of the secession of the <rs>State</rs> the law of citizenship was controlled under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">U. S. Constitution</rs> by uniform rules of naturalization; but when <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> became a free and independent sovereignty, and prescribed for herself the manner of conferring citizenship, with a policy of enlarged patriotism, she adopted an ordinance making every person, at the time of secession, residents in her borders, citizens of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This was not a compulsory act, but a gift of privilege to be accepted by residents of foreign birth in the nature of letters patent, under the <rs>English</rs> system, where citizenship was <hi rend="italics">ex donatione regis.</hi> The persons not desiring to become citizens were required to give notice of the fact by filling in the <rs>Clerk</rs>'s <orgName>Office of the Courts</orgName> their papers to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The reason of this was obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The status of each individual was important to be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Relying on the fidelity of her citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> was desirous of ascertaining all who disregarded the obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Under this ordinance the petitioner became a citizen of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; he was within the scope and jurisdiction of the law, and failed to file any paper of contrary import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>As a sovereign power, the <rs>Judge</rs> held that <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> had the right to pass the law, for questions of citizenship were solely and exclusively within her own mode and manner of legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The petitioner having accepted the citizenship conferred, became, on the entrance of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, with all the obligations of citizenship legally and morally resting upon him. In strictness of language he was not an <hi rend="italics">alien,</hi> but a <hi rend="italics">citizen <q>&#x0022;ex donatione regis.&#x0022;</q></hi> He had accepted the benefits of the law, its immunities and privileges, and he, and all in his condition, must, in the opinion of the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, stand up to the responsibilities it entails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>That military service is the duty of the citizen of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, is too plain for argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The <num value="1000">thousands</num> who to-day endure the hardships of the camps and the perils of the field attest it. The petitioner being a citizen by act of the <rs>Convention</rs> and his own acceptance, then he is liable to military duty.

But the <q>&#x0022;change coming over&#x0022;</q> them comes too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If they owed allegiance to foreign powers when <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> passed her act of citizenship, why did they not say so?--In the opinion of the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, men of foreign birth in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> at the time of secession, owe their allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> by reason of their citizenship in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and the act of the <rs>State</rs>, and should have no exemption from the duties devolved upon other citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It was, to say the least, too convenient a method of casting upon others the defence of their homes property, and families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It would be showing too timid a respect for the rights of foreigners to release them from military duty, when, under the laws of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, no difference is known between her citizens, from whatever clime they hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In return for the immunity, privileges, and protection granted and guaranteed to them, they must recognize an allegiance which is legal, and should be natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This was no time for adopted citizens to falter on the road of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In the hour of sunshine and peace <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> was the home of their adoption and choice, and now that the storm of war howls upon her mountains and smokes along her shore, they must illustrate their adoption by acts of patriotism, and not disgrace their loyalty by pretexts of foreign allegiance. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> A writer in a contemporary journal, who approves of the <rs>President</rs>'s Message in that part relating to the conscription, says, in substance, that we have already men enough &mdash; that large armies are unwieldily, and therefore not apt to render so much service as small ones &mdash; that as a proof, <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName> failed in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The general inference is, that we shall do better with a small army than with a large <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The philosopher who maintained that <num value="0.5">a half</num> was greater than the whole, is not, it seems, without disciples. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Why the fate of these last should have been wholly overlooked in the construction of a general rule deduced from example of military failure, we are at a loss to imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>But before we give our assent to the startling proposition that the larger the army the more certain the failure, it would be well to inquire a little into facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>How were the <rs>Northern</rs> barbarians enabled to break the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Empire into fragments?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>By their numbers unquestionably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Their numbers, beyond all doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>There is a case directly in point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The Poles fought as gallantly as it was possible for men to fight, but their army was comparatively small, and they were conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It is extremely difficult to conquer a people thoroughly united and resolved to do their utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>To conquer such a people as ours we hold to be impossible.
