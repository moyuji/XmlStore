The order not being attended to, she shared off a little further, triced up her ports, and fired a blank gun, at the same time hoisting the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>A number of her crew were stationed on her quarter-deck with rifles, which they kept firing off whenever any of our crew showed themselves in an exposed situation, but the man at the helm seemed to be their principal aim, as several balls were found on the deck close to him. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> round shot they fired (which judging from the report, seemed to be about a <num value="12">12</num> pounder, passed overhead close by the mainmast, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in the same line, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, evidently intended to disable our rudder, fell a few feet short of the quarter.--The wind having fallen lighter prevented us from heading the bark, and as both vessels lay parallel to each other, any shot might have picked off some of our crew and injured some of our spars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <rs>Captain</rs>, therefore, deemed it prudent to heave to. The firing ceased; a boat was lowered and manned by <num value="4">four</num> armed men and an officer, who, on arriving on board and having examined our papers, apologized for detaining us, and said that, as our ship was so much like an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>- built ship, they suspected we were deceiving them by hoisting the <rs>English</rs> ensign and more especially as we made all sail to get away from her as soon as she fired the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In answer to our inquiries as to the name of the vessel, the boat's crew did not seem inclined to be communicative, but we understood she was called the <rs>Tuscaloosa</rs>, and had been captured by the <rs>Alabama</rs>, which vessel they had left a short time previous off the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>.--She is a sharp looking bark of about <num value="25">25</num>) or <num value="300">300</num> tons, with a narrow white streak along the gunwale &mdash; They had been doing what they could to make her something man of war like, but her sails and rigging aloft presented a seedy appearance.--During the quarter of an hour which elapsed from the time we made sail until we have to, <num value="10">ten</num> round-shots were fired at us, and the rifle balls we could not compute, (say about <num value="30">30</num>.) Immediately on the return of her boat alongside she dipped her ensign to us in token of good bye, and stood away southward, we also making all sail and standing on our course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>--The statement of the noble <rs>Earl</rs> would be very striking if he had correctly remembered the facts of the discussion to which he alludes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The noble <rs>Earl</rs> has represented the case as if I had stated that the production of the correspondence to which he now alludes between <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> and me was dangerous to the public service, and as if I had been supported in that opinion by the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs> and the law officers of the <name>Crown</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>As I recollect it, my statement was not that the production of the correspondence as relating to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and this country would be dangerous, but that the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> was of opinion that its production would lead to incomplete discussion in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> upon partial information, and therefore would be injurious to the cause of the <name>Crown</name> in a case which is coming on in a court of law. [Hear, hear.] As <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> I did not feel authorized in giving papers to Parliament when the principal law officer of the <name>Crown</name> told me their production would be injurious to the cause of the <name>Crown</name> in a case to be tried in a court of law. That is an entirely different statement from that which the noble <rs>Earl</rs> represents me as making &mdash; that I thought there would be some public danger in the production of those papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The change which has taken place has taken place with the person who objected to their production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>[Derisive cheers from the opposition.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> It was not I who made the objection, but my honorable and learned friend the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>On reconsidering the matter he told me he had come to the opinion that the papers could be produced not entirely without mischief, but without all the mischief which he apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The objective of the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> being waived, my objection is waived too, because I have no other </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> objection than that which he stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>At the same time I think it very probable that the production of those papers will have some mischievous and bad consequences attached to it, because now it seems to be thought, although I do not remember any former time when it has been thought, that nothing can be so proper, so becoming, so Parliamentary, as to endeavor to get out the whole case of the <name>Crown</name>, and thereby to damage the cause of the <name>Crown</name> in a case which they have pending in a court of law. [Hear.] With regard to the other papers referred to by the noble <rs>Earl</rs> the case is not quite what he imagines it to be &mdash; that papers moved for and refused in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> were at once granted in this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> &mdash; The fact is that when my noble friend moved for a general account of the number of cases between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and this country, I did object, and I said that there were <num value="20">twenty</num> volumes of papers already bound, and matter for <num value="20">twenty</num> volumes more, the production of which would be very in convenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The noble <rs>Earl</rs> explained to me that he did not require all the papers &mdash; that he wished to have, in fact, a list of the cases upon which claims had been founded, whether for personal injury or loss of property, and I thought there might be some convenience, and, at all events, no objection, in having such a list made out. I have inquired how soon it can be done, and I find the making out of the list will take about <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> or upwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> I do not propose to give more than that list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>I do not propose to give the dispatches, which were moved for in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, except in <num value="1">one</num> particular case, with regard to which the noble <rs>Earl</rs> threw some doubt on the conduct of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The case is that of a mate of a merchant vessel who was killed, where it has been imputed that the <rs>Government</rs> did not show proper earnestness in requiring the accused person to be brought to trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>I thought there ought to be no doubt in such a case, and that if the <rs>Government</rs> have done wrong it should be known, and that if the <rs>Government</rs> have shown proper activity it should also be made clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The course taken in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> is therefore not contradictory to the course which I have taken with regard to those papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Neither is there any difference between the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs> and myself, because the objection to the other papers being produced was made on account of the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs>, and not on account of the foreign affairs of the country.--[Hear, hear.] </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It relates to a promise which I understood the noble <rs>Earl</rs> to have given in this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> about a week since in reference to a motion which I then made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>My motion contained <num value="3">three</num> points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was a return of claims made on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government by <name>British</name> subjects; and I certainly was astonished to hear that it would take <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> to draw up, inasmuch as I believed that it would be contained in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> sheets of foolscap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> part of the motion referred to the correspondence in the case of the <rs>Saxon</rs>, and that the noble <rs>Earl</rs> agreed to. That correspondence had been previously asked for and refused in the other <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Therefore, my noble friend was perfectly accurate in stating that papers refused in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> had been granted here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>[Hear, hear] I also asked for a copy of the instructions in the case of the <rs>Tuscaloosa</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It may be proper here to state, however, as a fact developed in the course of our investigation, that many of the newly-arrived conscripts do suffer for the want of clothes and blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>This is not the fault of the commander or his officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It results from the circumstance that conscripts recently enrolled are sometimes hurried to camp without an opportunity being afforded them to visit home and provide themselves with clothes and blankets, and make other preparations for camp life, but often from their own neglect to do so after ample notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>If there be blame anywhere, it is attributable to the carelessness or in difference of the enrolling officer in the country to the wants and comforts of the conscripts, or to defects in the provisions or execution of the law. The fault lies here, and not, as your committee are assured, in the administration of the laborious and responsible department, under the management of the commandant, <persName n="Shields,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shields</surname></persName>, whose high character, urbane manners, delicate feelings of humanity, and eminent qualifications for his post, forbid the conclusion that he would exercise his authority otherwise than in the most considerate and humane manner to <unclear>d</unclear> the conscripts under his charge, or would practice or <unclear>rate </unclear> any other than a proper care and attention to their wants and necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>As far, therefore, as your committee could peruse their investigation, and it was as searching at the nature of the case, and their sources of information admitted, they could discover no instance of a death, cruelty, inhumanity, or even of extreme suffering or hardship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Hardships there undoubtedly are and have been; but only such and not more severe than are incident to camp fare and a soldier's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>We were informed by the surgeon, <persName n="Palmer,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Palmer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Palmer</surname></persName>, of a case where a man fell in a fit; but he was known to be subject to fire and they were not produced by exposure to the cold, as the surgeons believes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It happened during the severe weather in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, and probably gave origin to the report of inhumanity at the camp, which was so widely propagated, and excited the sensibility of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> and the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> Your committee did not consider themselves limited in their inquiries to the rumor of suffering among the conscripts for the want of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Their duty embraced a wider scope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It was to examine whether any abuses or inhumanity was practiced or tolerated at <placeName reg="Camp Lee">Camp Lee</placeName> in the treatment of conscripts, in any way or in any form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName> had a special interest in the investigation, as the camp is near her capital, and the place of rendezvous for her conscript soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Over them she was bound to exercise a parental care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Your committee, therefore, proceeded to <placeName reg="Camp Lee">Camp Lee</placeName>, and take pleasure in stating were received with politeness and courtesy by <persName n="Shields,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shields</surname></persName>, the commandant, and all the officers at the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Every facility and opportunity were afforded them for examination and inquiry into the condition of the camp, and of the wants, necessities, accommodations, and comforts of the men. <persName n="Shields,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Shields</surname></persName>, himself, and all of his officers, frankly and with alacrity, responded to every inquiry addressed to them touching the matters to which we directed our inquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>We were allowed unrestricted access to every place we desired to visit, and an officer accompanied us to show us through the hospital, the barracks, and quarters of the men, which we inspected as closely as time and our inexperienced habits in relation to such matters would enable us. We found the hospital clean, well provided with comfortable beds and bed clothing, and we do not doubt, the patients are attentional nursed, and attended with skillful medical treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The large building appropriated as the principal quarters of the men, we would remark, is, by reason of the open floors, being made of green plank, and the small fire places, difficult to be warmed sufficiently to be comfortable in extremely cold weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>But otherwise the quarters are dry and well cleaned and as well adapted to the sleeping uses of the healthy soldier as could be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/><placeName reg="Camp Lee">Camp Lee</placeName> is situated upon an elevated plain, remarkably dry, and represented to be unusually healthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Although it was generally understood at camp that the committee had made the visit to ascertain if there existed or had been practiced any abuses, yet no complaints were made, nor in answer to inquiries could we learn that any existed upon which complaints could be founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>No facts, at least, were brought to our knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Your committee take pleasure in reporting this as the result of their inquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They believe that the investigation will have a good effect, and was, under the circumstances and gravity of the charges, alike due to our conscripts and the officers of the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>It will show to our people that the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> are not insensible to the wants and sufferings of our noble soldiers, in whatever field or camp they are called to render service to their country; nor faithless to her solemn obligations to extend a parental care over them, and to shield and protect them whenever oppression and distress may come upon them.--It will accomplish more; it will relieve the minds of distant families and friends as to the supposed maltreatment of husbands, sons, and brothers in <placeName reg="Camp Lee">Camp Lee</placeName>, and mitigate something of that repulsiveness and dread with which that military post is viewed by conscripts who are sent there pursuant to military regulations. </p>
