<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>These, however, were several times dislodged, and every attempt at an advance was foiled by the heavy fire of our artillery.--Late in the afternoon the enemy emerged from the woods in line of battle, and advanced swiftly towards Batteries <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="6">6</num> and <num value="7">7</num>, some <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> to my left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> A Northern journal asserts that the only reason the <rs>Western</rs> troops have been more successful than the <rs>Northern</rs> in this war is that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was their commander. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> It is idle to expect in any Northern newspaper the language of reason, sobriety, or truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The Western troops may not be braver or more resolute than the <rs>Northern</rs>, but they are hardier, more accustomed to the use of arms, and withal have a strong admixture of Southern blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Many of the original setters of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Ohio</placeName>, were emigrants from the <rs>Southern States Kentucky</rs> and some portions of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> have furnished the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the best troops of its <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Western army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>But not all these facts combined account for the successes of the <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Western army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Those successes were the result of an immense preponderance of numbers, and, in some instances, of our own mismanagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Certainly, it was not the generalship of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to which the credit is due.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> We have no desire to detract from his military character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>He is brimful of bovine energy, but his brains are not equal to his pluck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Even his pluck, so far as we have any proof, consist in a readiness to have his men slaughtered rather than expose himself to personal permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We hear of him smoking, we hear of him whetting; we hear of his stereotyped order, &#x0022;Send the men in,&#x0022; but we do not hear of his going in himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>This is no impeachment, we confess, of his courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Nor is it the duty of a commander in chief to expose himself to danger; but when pluck is claimed as his distinguishing quality, we deny that the exposure of other men to danger affords any proof of it. In military genius there is no comparison between <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,Gen,,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The boasted achievement of transferring his army from the north to the south bank of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName> might have been accomplished in the beginning of his campaign without the loss of a single life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>He might have come at once to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,Gen,,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s old position and crossed the river, or he might have landed on the <rs>Southside</rs> and reached <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Instead of that, he came upon a line which he proclaimed he would hold if it took him all summer, and sacrificed <num value="75">seventy-five</num> or a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men to reach a point which he might have reached without expending a drop of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>If he had a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men to spare why not send them to <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, while he pressed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Nannie,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> on the <rs>Rapidan</rs> ?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> If ever there has been a fixed and universal opinion in the <rs>North</rs> on any <num value="1">one</num> subject, it is that slave labor is unprofitable, or, in their choice vernacular, that it &#x0022;doesn't pay.&#x0022; However they may have differed at <num value="1">one</num> time upon the abolition question, there never was any difference about the greater cheapness of free labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The same economical ideas that led to the extinguishment of serfdom in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> were applied with an air of greater plausibility to the slave labor of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It was alone because negro slavery was unprofitable that it was abolished in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and no <num value="1">one</num> there was able to see why it should not be equally valueless in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, especially those not engaged in cotton growing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>They maintained that <num value="1">one</num> white man could do the work of <num value="3">three</num> negroes; that &#x0022;the black pigs of the <rs>Virginia</rs> litter were draining her dry,&#x0022; that but for slavery <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would be <num value="1">one</num> of the wealthiest and greatest of communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The slaves were described as wasteful, improvident, filthy, an incubus upon the resources and growth of the white population. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> Keeping in mind this universal Northern conviction, we must of course recognise their wholesale plunder of slaves in this war as a benevolent effort to relieve us of a great nuisance ! We wonder they have not put it themselves upon that ground, and claimed to be our greatest benefactors ! Finding that we could not be induced by persuasion and reasoning to do justice to our own interests, they are foreing us to our own good by sword and plunder ! Earnest and energetic philanthropists, they will permit no community to go to destruction its own way ! They take away our negroes in order to relieve the <rs>State</rs> from a heavy drag upon its energies and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Is it not wonderful that we are ungrateful to such benefactors ? We cling to our &#x0022;incubus&#x0022; as closely as ever; we are determined not to give it up; but we have a passion still stronger than our predilection for slavery.--It is, strange to say, our detestation of the philanthropical pedlars who are endeavoring to swindle us out of our property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>If every negro in the <rs>State</rs> were stolen, we should only detest the idea of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> domination the more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We would rather lose all our slaves than be slaves to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>It may suit the purposes of the <rs>North</rs> to represent the <rs>Southern</rs> defence to the world as a war for slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>It is no such thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The writer has no interest whatever in the arrangement suggested, except for the public good and the benefit of the officers and men in these regiments, both of which, he thinks, would be thereby promoted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> Both regiments being under the direction of an officer of a rank superior to that of <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, the duties of each regiment, it seems to the writer, would be more certain of being equally apportioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The regiments are suppose to be on an equal footing, and I am sure that the men in both are ready cheerfully to perform their fair share of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>This cannot always be done while each regiment is acting independently of the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> As an illustration of this, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 19">19th regiment</orgName> have almost to the last man, been performing responsible guard duty constantly, without relief, for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">1st regiment</orgName>, at the end of that time, very readily came to their relief, and are now doing the same heavy duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> In this instance nearly all the men of each regiment are alternately kept on guard until worn out, whereas, if the change were made which is here suggested, under <num value="1">one</num> directing head, the business could be systematized and the duties judiciously distributed, so as to add much to the comfort of the officers and men, as well as to the efficiency of the service they render. </p>
