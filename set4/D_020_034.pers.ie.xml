<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Being an <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> by birth, and then a naturalized <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, and now a devoted citizen of this Confederacy, I felt it my duty to warn my own countrymen against enlisting in that Legion, and against fighting in favor of principles contrary to those that have procured the independence of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> Deeply interested as I am in the cause of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, I hope you will allow me to address you for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, submitting, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that I had a military education in the <rs type="place">Pyrotechnical Military School</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, which I entered a short time after <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> left that kingdom, and where, therefore, the <rs>French</rs> system of instruction continued for some time to prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>From there, after a rigid examination, I passed to be a commissioned officer in the corps of the <rs type="role" reg="Topographical Engineer">Topographical Engineer</rs>, and Etat-<rs type="role2">Major</rs>; and as the service of that corps was entirely my profession, and I understand, therefore, the great need that every well organized <unclear>arm</unclear> of a proportionate number of well <unclear>sed</unclear> officers in that branch, I see with regret that, while our adversaries of the <rs>North</rs> have resolved in Congress to increase the efficiency and number of the <rs type="role" reg="Topographical Engineer">Topographical Engineers</rs>, nothing has been done on our side towards procuring for us the same advantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> It would be too long here for me to demonstrate the necessity of such a corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and certainly many of our instructed and well educated officers, have, when nothing else, read military history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>They know what account <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> made of the <rs type="role" reg="military-Engineer">military engineers</rs>; how indispensable he deemed the institution to be. They know not <unclear></unclear>the opinion of foreigners upon the subject, but also that of the intelligent and learned <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> engineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>They have probably read the fine work of <persName n="Halleck,Captain,H.,Wager,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="default:Halleck,H.,Wager,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>Wager</foreName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>; they are probably acquainted with the report made by <persName n="McClelland,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:McClelland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>McClelland</surname></persName> on the <name>Crimean</name> war, of which he was an eye-witness, as sent there by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>, in order to examine and report; they have seen the advantages that the <rs>French</rs> derived by a strict adherence to the technical rules of the science of the engineer, and the disadvantages that the <rs>English</rs> suffered on account of negligence towards that part of military science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>They know, also, that the engineer is not obtained by a knowledge cheaply acquired, of a little of strategy or of field engineering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>He must be thoroughly trained in all the sciences that regard his employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The engineer, It is true, must be acquainted with strategy and temporary fortifications; but this knowledge alone would be too little for him. He could not with it fulfill <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of his duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>There are some that inconsiderately, and perhaps presumptuously speak; throwing discredit on the science of the well educated engineer; they pretend to consider it, up to a certain extent, as superfluous and obsolete, but they cannot be sure of what they say; they think they are sustained by some mistaken opinions spread by injudicious persons, who inconsiderately viewed the operations before <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,2650580">Sebastopol</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>; but they have not taken the trouble of reading the remarks made by <persName n="Neil,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Neil,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Neil</surname></persName>, in his journal of the siege of that place, nor those of <persName n="McClelland,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:McClelland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>McClelland</surname></persName>, or they would certainly have come back from their error. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> I hope, then, that, although our experienced <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are now too much occupied to think of this subject, our Congress at least will take it into consideration, and provide in time, that the <name>Confederation</name> might not be destitute of a good and efficient number of well-instructed topographical engineers, and not let our enemies acquire over us a superiority on that score.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They will understand, I hope, not only that the engineer is to be educated, even in time of peace, in order to be thoroughly prepared and properly formed when the war breaks out, but that in time of peace also he has much to do, and among us in particular; for, when peace is made, shall we not have need, like any other civilized nation, of a system of permanent fortifications on our frontiers and the sea-coast? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> But I have a few more words to say. What is the reason that, while our publishers and booksellers advertise for the sale of books of tactics, camp duty, hand-books for artillery, instruction for cavalry, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c., they do not take the least trouble to publish any good and thorough book on fortification, mines, attack and defence, &#x0026;c.? The only book that bears something of that title, is <persName n="Buckholtz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Buckholtz,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckholtz</surname></persName>; but do they really think that the author intended to give any reasonable information on engineering?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>He only intended to make the infantry officers acquainted with the name of some works, and, at most, with constructing a single profile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>But that is not in the least what we want; let them at least publish Mahanton fortification, with all its maps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>And even that is not all. Can they not find any of the excellent <name>French</name> works, as Cormontaigne, <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>, D'Argon, or others; also, <num value="1">one</num> on what is called in <persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, <hi rend="italics">Defilement?</hi> Cannot those who own such works lend them to the publishers, who could thus confer a benefit on their own country and also on themselves; for, after all, these books would be bought with avidity not only by the officers of the army, but also by many who would like to study engineering?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Books on strategy would also be needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/> Our people have not yet recovered from the terrible thrashing the <rs>South</rs> gave us on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The papers here and elsewhere had all figured up a victory in advance, and hence, when the <name>Waterloo</name> defeat was announced, coupled with the fact that our troops were retreating back upon <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the shock fell upon us like a shower bath in a winter day, and it will be some time before our recovery will be complete. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/> It had been agreed that the victors in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great clash of arms would wear upon their arms the omen of a like glorious result in the end, and the triumph of Southern arms in the conflict just closed has cast a feeling of misgiving throughout every city of the <rs>North</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/> People here, indeed, are astounded at the military tact, capabilities and shrewdness of the <q> &#x0022;enemy,&#x0022;</q> and they now find, after a most bitter, costly and bloody lesson, that they have a foe to deal with who is worthy of their steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>It is now clear that the men brought together on the upper Potomac under <persName n="Patterson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00292" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>, and those under <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00293" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, were never designed to act separately, or, except as skirmishing parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>The movements in both these directions were, in fact, feints, designed to divide and distract us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/> The grand expedition which was to do the principal work of the invasion, was that fitted out at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and directed against this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Every man that could be made available for this object was there joined to it, every piece of artillery brought <unclear>ul</unclear> and every resource exhausted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> For several days previous to <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00294" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Emma,Amelia,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s advance, we had observed great activity on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00295" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> doubtless understood them, but to the army and general observer they seemed only suspicious.--The chief mystery about them was that troops seemed to be going down and not up, where the real expedition was being fitted out. --This, in fact, was the statement of Northern correspondence and papers; it was heralded even from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and the <rs type="place">Yorktown Peninsula</rs> that <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> was being largely reinforced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/> Nevertheless, to observers at various points on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, near <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, Acoly to <persName n="Mills,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00296" reg="mostcommon:Mills,nomatch:0"><surname>Mills</surname></persName>, &#x0026;c., in the vicinity of the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, these movements did not appear to be precisely what they were said to be. The fleet of steamers on the river frequently carried up more men than they carried down, and not seldom what appeared to be ammunition, stores, artillery, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/> The truth of all this has now come out--<placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> was never reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>On the contrary, everything, both of men, artillery and ammunition, that could be spared therefrom, was all the time being brought up to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for this very expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The same, also, is true of the movements of <persName n="Patterson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00297" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName> on the <rs>Upper Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Those movements were, from the beginning, feints, designed only to distract our attention, annoy us, and finally to co-operate with <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00298" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Emma,Amelia,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> on the <rs type="place">Manassas Plains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>This explains all his advances and retreats, his repeated offers of battle and refusal to accept the same, his loud sounding pretensions, and real inability to cope with the man he was trying to amuse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/> This, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> saw from the beginning, and it will serve to explain many of his movements, before misunderstood.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/> It is probable that <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00302" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Emma,Amelia,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> saw at last that <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00303" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00304" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> had found out his plans; he probably saw, moreover, that his plans might by no means work well; that in fact <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00305" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> had it in his power to be with <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00306" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,Gen,,,"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> hours before <persName n="Patterson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00307" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><surname>Patterson</surname></persName> could be before <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00308" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/> It was in consequence of this that just before the advance <rs>Scott</rs> ordered <persName n="Patterson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00309" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><surname>Patterson</surname></persName> to engage <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> at any odds and at whatever cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>This <name>Patterson</name>, no doubt, as we infer from his movements at the time, sought to do. But then he was fooled by <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, who refused to gratify him now by giving him battle, except on his own terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> In the meantime, the day of the grand advance approached, necessarily the original plan was at last resorted to. Unable to engage <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, <persName n="Patterson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00313" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><surname>Patterson</surname></persName> was immediately ordered on to <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>This movement was observed and understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>That same day the enemy advanced from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, and this was also reported.
