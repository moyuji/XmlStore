<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The <orgName n="Houston Telegraph" type="newspaper">Houston <hi rend="italics">Telegraph</hi></orgName> gives an excellent description of the naval engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <rs type="place">Bayou City</rs>, a Houston and <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName> packet, had been taken by the <rs>State</rs> and fitted up as a gunboat, under charge of <persName n="Lubbock,Captain,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Lubbock,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Lubbock</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>She was armed with a <num value="31">31</num> pounder rifled gun on her bow deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Bulwarks of cotton bales were built up on her sides, and a force of a <num value="100">hundred</num> men put on board of her. The <rs>Neptune</rs>, another Bayou packet, was taken on the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="2">16th</day></dateStruct>, and, under direction of <persName n="Smith,Major,Leon,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Smith,Leon,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Leon</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, fitted up as a gunboat as well as it could be done in the brief time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Bulwarks of cotton bales were built up also on her guards, and she had much the appearance, when she left <placeName reg="Houston, Harris, Texas" key="tgn,7013727">Houston</placeName>, of a well loaded cotton boat, taking her cargo down to <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName> for shipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They waited till the moon went down, a little after <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>, anxiously listening for the report of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At dawn of day the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> was discovered, and when within about half a mile the <rs type="place">Bayou City</rs> opened fire on her with the <measure n="32l." type="pounds"><num value="32">32</num> pound</measure> rifled gun while she was engaged with the shore batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Several shots were fired, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> striking her plumb behind the wheel, knocking a hole in her big enough for a man to crawl through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> was lying at anchor, with steam on, swinging with a strong ebb tide, bow to the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I was instructed, says <persName n="McCormick,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>McCormick</surname></persName>, the pilot, to endeavor to so hit her as to allow the men a chance to board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Going with a strong ebb tide I dare not run against her bow, so I endeavored to strike forward of the larboard wheel house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Owing to the position of the <rs type="place">Lane</rs> and the strength of the tide I missed my aim, struck a glancing blow, and passed by. The wheelhouse and upper works of the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> being very strong, tore off the outside planking of the <rs type="place">Bayou City</rs>'s larboard wheelhouse and side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><persName n="Lubbock,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lubbock,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Lubbock</surname></persName> ordered me to get around as soon as possible, and make at her again, the boat having nothing to depend upon but her sharpshooters and her qualities as a ram. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Meantime the <rs>Neptune</rs> came up, striking the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> on the starboard side, getting her bow stove in, and causing her to leak badly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>She then passed round under the stern of the <rs type="place">Lane</rs>, receiving her shots as she passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><num value="1">One</num> of the shots of the <rs type="place">Lane</rs> struck the <rs>Neptune</rs>'s hull, causing her to take water last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>She got on the edge of the channel, and soon sunk in <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure>-water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> By this time the <rs type="place">Bayou City</rs> had rounded to with head up stream, and run into the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs>, striking her fairly all of the larboard wheel-house, and running her bow so far under the gunwale and wheel that she could not be extricated, and the <num value="2">two</num> vessels stuck fact together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>As soon as we struck the order to board was given, which was immediately obeyed--<persName n="Smith,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Leon,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, owing to his experience as a sailor, being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Many of the boys failed in climbing the netting, and could not get over until they had cut it away, which was soon done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>As soon as our men appeared on the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> her crew deserted the dock and took to the hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It was soon made known by some officer on board that the ship surrendered, and the crew asked to be received and treated as prisoners of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> For some time after the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> surrendered, the other vessels continued to fire, directing their fire at the <rs type="place">Lane</rs>, the <rs type="place">Bayou City</rs>, and the <rs>Neptune</rs>, although the latter had settled to the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs>Owasso</rs> came up to within <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> and fired several shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>An effort was made to turn the <rs type="place">Lane</rs>'s guns on her, but she was so listed by the pressure of the <rs type="place">Bayou City</rs> under her gunwale that they could not be worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><persName n="Lubbock,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Lubbock,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Lubbock</surname></persName> then suggested to <persName n="Smith,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Leon,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> that it would be well to make the officer who delivered up the ship run up the white flag, which was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Once fairly separated, they would begin to feel wants, the existence of which they do not now admit, and they would be only too ready to avail themselves of those commercial abilities which they have heretofore affected to despise.

<head>The <rs>North Revealed</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> This war has indeed made some remarkable revelations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>It has lifted the veil from human nature, and let in a light upon its dark places like the searching blaze of the <name>Day</name> of Judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The surface civilization of the age has been stripped from its enclosures, and displayed beneath the same evil passions which the inspired records teach us are characteristics of the heart of man beyond the power of any human agency to change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The world, and especially the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> part of it, has been exulting in the delusion of human perfect ability, and pointing, in proof of it to the progress of man in humanity since former ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>But a few years ago it was even doubted whether wars would not soon come to an end. We believe it was Victor Huge who declared, in a speech at the <orgName n="Peace Congress" type="congress">Peace Congress</orgName> in <placeName reg="Paris, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040685">Paris</placeName>, that a cannon would <num value="1">one</num> day become a great curiosities, and exhibited with other curiosities in the museums of the Old World as a relic of the ancient barbarism of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>But the dreams of the amiable enthusiasts of peace were suddenly dissipated by the <name>Crimean</name> war, then by the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> mutiny, then by the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> war, and lastly by the bloody convulsions in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, which have scattered to the winds the visions of dreaming philosophers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The veneering of civilization has been rudely torn from the real character of man. It has proved but the velvet covering over the claws of the tiger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The genuine instincts of the brute are all aroused by the sight of blood, and he at once begins to fight, in the language of the <name>Gorilla</name>, &#x0022;with gloves off.&#x0022; In no part of the world and no period of its history has this been more manifest than in the external transformation which the <rs>North</rs> has undergone in this war. If any <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10">ten</num> or even <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago had predicted that the <rs>Northern</rs> people would have made such a display of themselves as we have witnessed since the inauguration of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, he would have been laughed at as an idiot or a mad man. If <num value="1">one</num> of their old worthies had risen from the dead and told them of the future, they would have exclaimed, as <num value="1">one</num> man, &#x0022;Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> It was the hand of Bible Societies, of Tract Societies, of Peace Societies, of Christian Associations-- to say nothing of steam, gas, electricity, and commerce, which <persName n="Mitchell,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="default:Mitchell,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> tells us are the osseous of modern civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>From its lofty religious and moral character, It looked down with the complacent spirit of genuine Pharisaism upon the benighted <num value="1000000">millions</num> of the old world and the publicans and sinners of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>In everything that pertained to the outside of the humanities it was perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Its very linen had an air of sanctimony about it, and the physiognomies of its saints were white placid, and solemn as the tombs of the ancient <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>But the war has taught us what we might have long ago learned from Revelation, that ostentations pretenders to piety are &#x0027;whitaned sepulchres full of dead men's bones,&#x0027; and that civilization, so called, has no more effect in altering the real nature of man than the moonbeams, which glitter upon a placid ocean, in changing the qualities of the sea. Never have a people so shamelessly cast askle all regard to honor, truth, humanity, common decency, as the <name>Puritanical</name> and civilized North in this unparalleled war. </p> </div3>

<head>Public sentiment Abroad.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> In holding up to last censure the unfriendly course of the <rs>English Government</rs> towards the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> we should be careful to discriminate between the <rs>Government</rs> and the <name>People</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The sympathy of intelligent <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, outside of the narrow and bigoted pale of the <rs>Palmersion Administration</rs>, is almost universal with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>This sympathy has been practically manifested in every manner which their opportunities afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>It has shown itself in the public press, the greater portion of the respectable newspapers siding ably and energetically with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>It has been seen in the co-operation of private enterprise with the <rs>Southern Government</rs> in furnishing arms, ships, and seamen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Not only the <rs>Alabama</rs> and her splendid armaments are of <name>British</name> manufacture, but most of her crew are thoroughbred <name>British</name> seamen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>If the public opinion of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had not been with us, none of the facilities which have been afforded as for carrying on the war could have been obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>We should be careful not to confound the generous and gallant majority of the <rs>English</rs> people with the short-sighted and illiberal clique of Palmersion and <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>If we have not received from the <rs>English Government</rs> what we had a right to expect, we have obtained bests of friends among the people, on whom we had no reason to calculate.--Before the war the <rs>South</rs> had scarcely a friend in the Old World.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Now, the <hi rend="italics">elite</hi> of all Christendom is arrayed on its side, and in the end will make its influence felt directly as well as indirectly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>We make these remarks from no disposition to extenuate the unfair and selfish policy of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>But let us always keep distinct and separate the policy of their Governments and the sentiments of their people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Let us not confound our friends with our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>If the <name>Governments</name> of the Old World were as directly swayed by public sentiment as in Republics, the recognition of Southern Independence would take place without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Let us be just, patient, and forbearing. </p> </div3>
