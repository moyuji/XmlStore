<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It were well worth <num value="1">one</num>'s while, if for no other purpose than to enjoy the contrast, to leave the odious mud, the shrouds of damp, the days of gloom and nights of darkness, which you of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> are now experiencing, and come to this land of balmy sunshine, budding flowers, odoriferous smells, excellent hearts, and cultivated understandings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is like escaping from an Egyptian pyramid into a crystal grotto, and exchanging the goblins of the mist, for the fairies of <q>&#x0022;an ampler other &mdash; a diviner air.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The trees are in blossom, the clover fields rich in fragrant bloom, the birds carolling as if the merry spring time of the year were upon us, and all Nature wears a drapery of loveliness, opulent in tints that would cool an August noon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> You can easily imagine, under these circumstances, the luxury of a soldier's life on the <rs>Southern</rs> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>No mud knee deep and rising, as at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>; no log huts and <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> rubber coats; no long-top boots and barbarous roads; no nothing which has made the camps of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> the <name>Golgotha</name> of the volunteer's existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Has the soldier here to keep step to the rhythm of his thoughts on the solitary midnight beat, the quiet stars look down upon him from the deep blue of the <name>Heavenly</name> dome, and the breezes are as mild as <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> zephyrs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Is it necessary to build entrenchments, big ditches, or do such drudgery of a campaign, a host of negroes relieve him of the task.--Is he hungry, his servants prepare superb repasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Is he ragged, the ladies of the <rs>State</rs> supply fresh garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Is he ill, a score of homes and hospitals invite him to enter and receive the tender nursing and watchful sympathy to which noble woman has here devoted herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Is anything required to alleviate his wants, add to his comforts, or sweeten the bitter potions of life, he has only to utter a word and the measure is full. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The soldiers of the grand army now in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> must not suppose, however, that because these blessings are poured out with such bountiful hands here, hearts are not beating and hands are not working for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The interest which the women of the <rs>South</rs> are taking in the war &mdash; and it is, in truth, the women who are carrying on this contest and smoothing the rugged pathway which leads to success &mdash; is bounded by no geographical limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The man who fights for his country any where, whether it be on the mountains of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, in the forests of the <rs>West</rs>, on the banks of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>, or on the sea-beard, occupies the same warm place in their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Here, soldiers can receive anything they desire, because they are at home.--Transportation is good, and communication is uninterrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Abroad the case is reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> there are now piled up in the depot <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> car loads of boxes and packages destined for the army, which have been detained there for weeks because of a lack of enterprise necessary to forward them to their destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>How much comfort is contained in that pile of parcels, eloquent with the sympathy and memory of distant friends!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>What a world of suffering might be relieved if railroad officials would only <num value="1">one</num> day forget the almighty dollar and transmit these needful articles to their owners! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> It is my intention on some future occasion to devote a chapter to the consideration of hospitals, and the efforts of women, in connection with the sanitary welfare of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>To-day, however, there are other matters pressing on my pen of equal interest, and which, with equal grace, may be embodied in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of a series of letters from this now attractive section of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Few people can visit <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> without being struck by the extraordinary oneness of sentiment which everywhere exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>With all the drawbacks the people have experienced &mdash; the blockade, the fire, the depopulation of homes, and other misfortunes incident to the war &mdash; there is a union of fortune and sympathy manifested in every relation of life which indicates that the great heart of the public is beating in grand accord with the march of passing events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Everything has been reduced to a war standard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> While cheerfulness and confidence is written on all faces, the name of gaiety has been almost forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>An evening party has not been held since the opening tocsin of the war. Houses have become factories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Women, whose hands never knew toil before, now ply the needle and the loom from morning till night &mdash; the tottering grand dame and the little child are alike devoted to the work of mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The silks and the satins which were wont to be seen on the daily promenade have given place to the plainer garbs of homespun, while the pleasures of visiting and sociability are exchanged for the tender charities which flow in loving streams at the bedside of the sick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The men are all in arms &mdash; even the aged, whom the law has exempted from military duty, have formed themselves into <hi rend="italics">corps de reserves,</hi> and await the moment of action when they may be called upon to defend their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The young men are in camp at various points in the <rs>State</rs>--come on the coast and some in the interior, but all armed, drilled, and ready for the foe. A few, a very few from the grand mass are at their homes discharged or on furlough, but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> note of alarm will carry them into the ranks of the army again, to do battle wherever danger calls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Of sick, there are, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>too many.--As in the incipiency of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, measles, typhoid fever, mumps, pneumonia, and other camp diseases, have their victims, and, notwithstanding the admirable sanitary regulations of the <rs>State</rs>, the best of nursing, good weather, and all the comfortable surroundings with which it is sought to encompass the volunteers, both hospitals and private houses present a sad array of humanity suffering from the worst of <q>&#x0022;ills that flesh is heir to.&#x0022;</q> So much for the social aspect of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and, indeed, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> generally. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Physically, the city wears a garb of mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The fire-fiend which a few weeks ago passed over the fairest portion of the town has left the trail of the serpent behind, and bright as may be the contrast afforded elsewhere, still the old thought comes back to you that the dark hand of affliction is lying heavily upon our dearest friends; that the rich have been made poor; the associations clustered around their homesteads have been destroyed, and that the existence of hundreds of individuals, once bright with the how of promise, has been set backward at least a score of years. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> It is a sad sight to pass through the burned district and see the ravages of the angry conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>From river to river its blackened monuments still stand, marking the savage fury with which it swept everything before it &mdash; the magnificent edifice and the humble cottage, church and warehouse, factory and workshop, all alike prostrate before the fiery blast, and nought left behind but irregular lines of cracked and crumbling walls, chimneys, plies of debris, </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;High towers, fair temples, goodly theatres, </l><l>Strong walls rich porches, princely palaces, </l><l>Fine streets, brave houses, sacred <sic>sepulchres,</sic> </l><l>All these turned to dust,&#x0022; </l><l>And overcome with conflagration's fiery rust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/></l> </lg> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p> Workmen have removed portions of the ruins dangerous to the public and obstructing the streets, and are still engaged in rescuing such articles of building material as have escaped destruction; but many months, if not years, will elapse, before the city will wear the same aspect it presented before the great event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Some of the ruins are beautiful in the most picturesque sense of the term--<num value="2">two</num> especially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I refer to what is called the <rs type="place">Circular Church</rs> and the <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> Cathedral &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> with its high walls, rows of tall brown pillars in front, circular shape, and grass-covered church-yard in the year, looking not unlike a miniature edition of the <name>Coliseum</name> at <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>; the last, resembling in its Gothic grotesqueness, its pointed arches, square steeple, tall windows, and artistic beauty, the rare old Abbeys which have come down to us preserved on the <rs>Kicher</rs>'s page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> with an artistic eye is struck by the beauty to which I have alluded, but unfortunately, there is a luck of either disposition or artists to save the picture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Speaking of grave-yards, it is a remarkable fact that although <num value="3">three</num> of these <q>&#x0022;gloomy mansions of the dead&#x0022;</q> were embraced in the circle of fire, not a tombstone has been defaced nor an obituary notice <unclear> terated.</unclear> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> A remarkable instance of the preservation of property was afforded in the <rs type="place">Mills House</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of the splendid hotels of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>With fire in front, fire on the side, and fire behind, the air filled with a storm of flakes large as your hand, the streets so thick with the burning rain that <num value="1">one</num> could not walk in it unless wrapped in a wet blanket, such was the coolness and energy displayed by the proprietors, a few friends, and the servants of the house, that the flames were beaten back, and the entire square, and probably the portion of the city behind it, saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>During this perilous hour, while hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars were at stake, and men were rushing wildly in all directions, seeking to preserve their property it is a noble tribute to manhood, that <persName n="Purcell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Purcell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Purcell</surname></persName>, forgetting himself and his valuable interests, sent his servants and a wagon to the house of an aged lady and saved, nearly every article she owned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>[Laughter.] He was not here to find fault with the <rs>Government</rs>; that was dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>[Laughter.] Such as it was, it was our only bulwark, and he was for standing by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The great question was, <q>&#x0022;What shall be done with the slaves after they are emancipated?&#x0022;</q> He appeared as <num value="1">one</num> who had studied Slavery on both sides of <placeName reg="Mason, Ingham, Michigan" key="tgn,2052604">Mason</placeName> and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>He considered himself an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>He was born on the most sacred part of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>[Laughter and applause.] There was nothing in the behavior of the colored race in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in this crisis, that should prevent him from being proud of being a colored citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>[Applause.] They had traitors of all other nations in <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName> as cold as <hi rend="italics">Slone</hi>--[laughter]--but they had no black man charged with disloyalty during this war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>[Laughter.] But, he would not complain &mdash; he only threw out these hints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>[Laughter.] The question was simply whether free institutions and liberty should stand or fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Any peace without emancipation would be a hollow peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had by a species of adumbration, come to realize this truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Slavery had kept our army quiet for <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure>, and displaced good and loyal men by incompetent and disloyal ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The question was. What shall be done with the <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> slaves if emancipated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We might ask what shall be done with the <num value="350000">350,000</num> slaveholders?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>His plan was, after the slaves were emancipated to let them alone, do nothing with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>[Laughter.] Let them take care of themselves as others do. [Applause.] The other day a man approached him, evidently taking him for an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>, and the following seems took places: </p>

<head>[for the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>.]<lb/>distilling &mdash; how it is Useful.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/> Being a subscriber and reader of your paper, I have of course seen the numerous publications on the subject of distilling, and <num value="1">one</num> only has met my approbation, because it advises that the subject should be dealt with practically and with common sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>It is in this light only that I desire to offer my views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>That there are evils attending distilling, no <num value="1">one</num> can deny, but there are ways by which the evil may be corrected and made productive of good, as in all the arrangements of the great Master workman, good and evil are so blended that it is impossible to enjoy or obtain the <num value="1">one</num> without the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Our most valuable antidotes are mixed with a deadly poison, and if in distilling an article is made that may be made productive of evil, its manufacture contributes more than any other pursuit to the breeding, raising, and converting swine into bacon, an article in dispensable to our army, thus, by preventing distilling, you greatly diminish and enhance the price of a great staple, the want of which we are already beginning to feel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> It is argued by some, that grain, after being distilled, will support almost as many hogs by the refuse or slop, as it would have done in pure grain or <unclear>mal</unclear> This, however, I do not believe; but I do know that the slop is valuable as a sustenance after the alcohol has been extracted from the grain, though perhaps not to the extent supposed by some &mdash; The farmer at this time has much to contend with, having no outlet for his wheat as heretofore, having a heavy tax to pay, all the necessaries for his farm being greatly inflated in price, is will require all his ingenuity to keep buckle and tongue together, and his labors will be exerted in proportion to the prospect of a fair remuneration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Thus, if the farmer thinks he will be allowed to distill his surplus grain, he will cultivate more, as he will have increased facilities for disposing of it. Suffer no <num value="1">one</num> but a farmer to distill, and only his own grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Let him be stopped when grain rises to some fixed price &mdash; always giving him time to dispose of his hogs before closing he business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Spirituous drinks have been used in all ages, and always will be; and the only difference in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is, that her people are now using their own instead of the large quantities heretofore imported from the <name>States</name> who are now endeavoring to cut our throats, and which was <num value="1">one</num> great branch of their prosperity; and hence the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of pounds of bacon they were enabled to send to our markets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/> In conclusion, let the farmer distill his own grain, and the quantity for sale will not be diminished, as he will certainly raise more, and much more meat, which will be in accordance with the great truth in Scripture, that man shall not live by bread alone. </p>
