<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The <num value="4">four</num> persons before named were then forcibly taken out of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>A further demand was made, that the commander of the <rs>Trent</rs> should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>proceed on board the <rs type="ship">San Jacinto</rs> but he said he would not go unless forcibly compelled likewise, and this demand was not insisted upon. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Upon this statement <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> remarks, that it thus appears that certain individuals have been forcibly taken from on board a British vessel, the ship of a neutral power, while that vessel was pursuing a lawful and innocent voyage, and act of violence which was an affront to the <rs>British</rs> flag and a violation of international law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> next says that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government bearing in mind the friendly relations which have long subsisted between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, are willing to believe that the naval officer who committed this aggression was not acting in compliance with any authority from his Government, or that if he conceived himself to be so authorized he greatly misunderstood the instructions he had received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> argues that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must be fully aware that the <rs>British Government</rs> could not allow such an affront to the national honor to pass without full reparation, and they are willing to believe that it could not be the deliberate intention of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> unnecessarily to force into discussion between the <num value="2">two</num> Governments a question of so grave a character, and with regard to which the whole <name>British</name> nation would be sure to entertain such unanimity of feeling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, resting upon the statement and the argument which I have recited, closes with saying that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government trust that when this matter shall have been brought under the consideration of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, it will, of its own accord, offer to the <rs>British Government</rs> such redress us could alone satisfy the <rs>British</rs> nation, viz: the liberation of the <measure n="4" type="prisoners">four prisoners</measure> taken from the <rs>Trent</rs>, and their delivery to your Lordship, in order that they may again be placed under <name>British</name> protection, and a suitable apology for the aggression which has been committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/><persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> finally instructs you to propose those terms to me, if I should not <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offer them on the part of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> This dispatch has been submitted to the <rs>President</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> The British Government has rightly conjectured that it is now my duty to state that <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, in conceiving and executing the proceedings in question acted upon his own suggestions of duty without any direction or instruction or even foreknowledge of it on the part of this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>No direction had been given to him or any other naval officer to arrest the <num value="4">four</num> person named or any of them, on the <rs>Trent</rs> or, on any other <name>British</name> vessel or on any other neutral vessel at the place where it occurred or else where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The British Government will justly infer from these fact that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> not only have had no purpose, but even no thought of forcing into discussion the question which has arisen, or any other which could effect in any way, the sensibilities of the <rs>British</rs> nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> It is true that a round shot was fired by the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs> from the pivot gun when the <rs>Trent</rs> was distantly approaching; but, as the facts have been reported to this Government the shot was nevertheless intentionally fired in a direction so obviously divergent from the course of the <name>Treat</name>, as to be quite as harmless as a blank shot, while it should be regarded as a signal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> So, also, we learn that the <rs>Trent</rs> was not approaching the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs> slowly when the shell was fired across her bow; but, on the contrary, the <rs>Trent</rs> was, or seemed to be, moving under a full head of steam, as it with a purpose to pass the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> We are informed, also, that the boarding officer (<persName n="Fairfax,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>) did not board the <rs>Trent</rs> with a large armed guard, but he left his marines in his boat when he entered the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He showed his instructions from <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> to search for the <measure n="4" type="prisoners">four prisoners</measure> named in a respectful and courteous though decided manner, and he asked the captain of the <rs>Trent</rs> to show his passenger list, which was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The <rs>Lieutenant</rs>, as we are informed, did not employ absolute force in transferring the passenger, but he used just so much as was necessary to satisfy the parties concerned that refusal or resistance would be unavailing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> So also we are informed that the captain of the <rs>Trent</rs> was not at any time or in any way required to go on board the <rs type="ship">San Jacinto</rs>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> I have now to remind your Lordship of some facts which doubtlessly were omitted by <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, with the very proper an becoming motive of allowing them to be brought into the case on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the way most satisfactory to this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>These facts are &mdash; that at the time the transaction occurred, an insurrection was existing in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which this Government was engaged in suppressing by the employment of land and naval forces, that in regard to this domestic strife, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> considered <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> as a friendly power, while she had assumed for herself the attitude of a neutral, and that <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> was considered in the same light and had assumed the same attitude as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> It has been settled by correspondence that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> mutually recognized as applicable to this local strife these <num value="2">two</num> articles of the declaration made by the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, viz: that the neutral or friendly flag should cover enemy's goods not contraband of war, and that neutral goods not contraband of war are not liable to capture under an enemy's flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>These exceptions of contraband from favor were a negative acceptance of the parties by the rule hither to every where recognized as a part of the law of nations, that whatever is contraband is liable to capture and confiscation in all cases. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The fact that these persons had assumed such characters, has been avowed by the same <rs>Jefferson Davis</rs> in a pretended message to an unlawful and insurrectionary Congress, It was, as we think, rightly presumed, that these Ministers bore pretended credentials and instructions, and such paper are in the law known as dispatches.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> Such a capture is the chief, if not the only recognized object of the permitted visitation and search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The principle of the law is, that belligerents exposed to danger may prevent the contraband person or thing from applying themselves or being applied to the hostile uses or purposes designed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The law is so liberal in this respect that when contraband is found on board neutral vessel, not only is the contraband forfeited, but the vessel, which is the vehicle of its passage or transportation being tainted, also becomes contraband, and is subjected to capture and confiscation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>but the question here concerns the mode of procedure in regard, not to the vessel that was carrying the contraband, nor yet to contraband things which worked the forfeiture of the vessel, but to contraband persons. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>He therefore has a right to a fair trial of the accusation against him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>They require a tribunal and a trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The captured and the captors are equals; the neutral and belligerent States are equals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>While the law authorities were found silent, it was suggested at an early day by this Government that you should take the captured persons into a convenient port, and institute judicial proceedings there to try the controversy.--But only Courts of Admiralty have jurisdiction in maritime cases, and these Courts have formulas to try only claims to contraband chattels, but none to try claims concerning contraband persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The <rs type="place">Courts</rs> can entertain no proceeding and render no judgments in favor of or against the alleged contraband men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> It was replied all this is true; but you can reach in those courts a decision which will have the moral weight of a judicial <num value="1">one</num> by a circuitous proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Convey the suspected vessel, into port, and try the question whether the vessel is contraband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>You can prove it to be so by proving the suspected men to be contraband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>If the men are not contraband, the men will escape condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Still there is no judgment for or against the captured persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>But it was answered that there would result from the determination of the court concerning the vessel, a legal certainty concerning the character of the men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> This course of proceeding seemed open to many objections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>It elevated be incident I inferior private interest into the proper place of the main paramount public <num value="1">one</num> and possibly it may make the fortunes, the safety or the existence of a nation, depend on the accidents of a merely personal and pecuniary illigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Moreover, When the judgement of the <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize court</orgName> upon the <unclear>law</unclear> of the capture of the vessel is tendered, it really concludes nothing, and binds neither the belligerent State nor the neutral upon the great questions of the disposition to be made of the captured contraband persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>That question is still to be really determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>if as all, by diplomatic arrangement or by war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> <num value="1">One</num> may well express his surprise when told that the law of nations has prescribed no more reasonable, practical and perfect mode than this of determining questions of such grave import between sovereign powers the regret we may feel on the occasion is nevertheless modified by the reflection that the difficulty is not altogether anomalous.--Similar and equal deficiencies are round in every <unclear>saylum</unclear> of municipal law, especially in the <unclear>saylure</unclear> which exists in the greater portion of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The title to personal property can hardly ever be resolved by court without resorting to the fiction that the claimant has lost and the possessor has found it, and she tittle to <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> is disputed by redlitigents under the name of imaginary persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>It must be confessed, however that white all aggrieved nations demand, and all impartial once concede, the need of some form of judicial process in determining the character of contraband person, no other form than the illogical and circuitous <num value="1">one</num> these desert bed exists nor has any other yet been suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Practically, therefore, the choice is <unclear></unclear> judicial remedy or <unclear>judicial</unclear> remedy whatever. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The captor is interested, prejudiced, and perhaps violent the neutral, if truly neutral, is disinterested, subdued, and helpless?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> to submit, though bound by no legal, moral, treaty obligation to acquiesce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> Preparation is distant and problematical, and depends at last on the justice, magnanimity or weakness of the <unclear></unclear> in which behalf, and by whose authority the capture was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Out of the disputes replicate and ware necessarily arise, and these are so frequent and destructive that it may well be doubted whether, this form of remedy is not a greater social evil than all that could follow if the belligerent right of search was universally renounced and abolished forever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> But carry the case <num value="1">one</num> step further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>What if the <rs>State</rs> that has made the capture, unreasonably refuse to hear the complaint of the neutral or to reduces it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>In that case the very act of capture would be an act of war, of war begun without notice and possibly without provocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>I think all unprejudiced minds will agree that, imperfect as she existing judicial remedy may be supposed to be, it would be, as a general practice, better to follow it than to adopt the summary <num value="1">one</num> of leaving the decision with the captor, and relying upon diplomatic debates to review his decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Practically, it is a question of choice between law with its imperfections and delays, and war with its evils and desolations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Nor is it ever to be forgotten that neutrality, honestly and justly preserved, is always the harbinger of peace, and, therefore, is the common interest of nations.--Which is only saying that it is the interest of humanity itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> At the same time it is not to be denied that it may sometimes happen that the judicial remedy will become impossible, as by the shipwreck of the prize vessel or other circumstances, which excuse the captor from sending or taking her into port for confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>In such a case the right of the captor to the custody of the captured persons, and to dispose of them if they are really contraband, so as to defeat their unlawful purposes, cannot reasonably be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>What rule shall be applied in such a case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Clearly the captor ought to be required to show that the failure of the judicial remedy results from circumstances beyond his control and without his fault, otherwise he would be allowed to derive advantage from a wrongful act of his own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> In the present case, <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, after capturing the contraband persons and making a prize of the <rs>Trent</rs>, in what seems to us a perfectly lawful manner, instead of sending her into port released her from the capture, and permitted her to proceed with her whole cargo upon her voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>He thus effectually, prevented the judicial examination which might otherwise have occurred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> Now, the capture of the contraband persons and the capture of the contraband vessel are to be regarded, not as <num value="2">two</num> separable or distinct transactions under the law of nations, but as <num value="1">one</num> transaction, <num value="1">one</num> capture only; then it follows that the capture in this case was left unfinished or abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Whether the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have a right to remain the chief public benefits of it &mdash; namely, the custody of the captured persons, on proving them to be contraband, will depend upon the preliminary question, whether the leaving of the transaction unfinished was necessary, and therefore voluntary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>If it was necessary, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, as we suppose, must of course waive the defect and the consequent failure of the judicial remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>On the other hand, it is not seen how the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can insist upon her waiver of that judicial remedy, if the defect of the capture resulted from an act of <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, which would be a fault on their own side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> has presented to this Government his reasons for releasing the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/><q>&#x0022;I forbore to seize her,&#x0022;</q> he says, in consequents of my being so reduced in officers and crew, and this derangement would cause innocent persons to suffer, there being a large number of passengers who would have been put to great loss and inconvenience, as well as disappointment from the interruption it would have caused them, in not being able to join the steamer from <placeName key="tgn,7013107;tgn,7005136" n="0.052 000000.1558	placename;tgn,7013107;saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;0.026 000000.0779	placename;tgn,7005136;Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America" reg="saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America">St. Thomas</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I, therefore, concluded to sacrifice the interest of my officers and crew in the prize, and suffered her to proceed, after the detention necessary to effect the transfer of those Commissioners, considering I had obtained the important and I had in view and which affected the interest of our country, and interrupted the action of that of the <rs>Confederates</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> I shall consider <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> how these reasons ought to affect the action of this Government, and secondly how they ought to be expected to affect the action of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> The reasons are satisfactory to this Government, so far as <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> is concerned; it could not desire that the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs>, her officers and crew should be exposed to danger and loss by weakening their number to detach a prize crew to go on board the <rs type="ship">Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Still less could it disavow the humans motive of preventing inconvenient losses and perhaps disasters to the several <num value="100">hundred</num> innocent passengers found on board the prize vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Nor could this Government perceive any ground for questioning the fact that these reasons, though apparently incongruous, did operate in the mind of <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> and determined him to release the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Human action generally proceeds from mingled and sometimes conflicting motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>He measured the sacrifices which his decision would cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It manifestly, however, did not occur to him that beyond the sacrifice of the private interests (as he calls them) of his officers and crew, there might, also, possibly be a sacrifice even of the chief and public object of his capture, namely: The right of his Government to the custody and disposition of the captured persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>This Government cannot censure him for this oversight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It confesses that the whole subject came unforeseen upon the <rs>Government</rs>, as doubtless it did upon him. Its present convictions on the point in question are, the result of deliberate examination and deduction now made, and not of any impressions previously formed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> Nevertheless, the question now is, not whether <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> is justified to his Government in what he did, but what is the present view of the <rs>Government</rs> as to the effect of what he has done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Assuming now, for argument's sake only, that the release of the <rs>Trent</rs>, if voluntary, involved a waiver of the claim of the <rs>Government</rs> to hold the captured persons, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could, in that case, have no hesitation in saying that the act which has thus already been approved by the <rs>Government</rs>, must be allowed to draw its legal consequence after it. It is of the very nature of a gift or a charity, that the giver cannot, after the exercise of his benevolence is past, recall or modify its benefits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> We are thus brought directly to the question, whether we are entitled to regard the release of the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>as involuntary, or whether we are obliged to consider that it is voluntary?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Clearly the release would have been made solely upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ground assigned for it by <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, namely, a want of sufficient force to send the prize vessel into port for adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>It is not the duty of a captor to hazard his own vessel in order to secure a judicial examination to the captured party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>No large prize crew, however, is legally necessary, for it is the duty of the captured party to acquiesce and go willingly before the tribunal to whose jurisdiction it appeals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>If the captured party indicate purposes to employ means of resistance which the captor cannot with probable safety to himself overcome, he may properly leave the vessel to go forward, and neither he nor the <rs>State</rs> he represents, can ever afterwards justly object that the captor deprived her of the judicial remedy to which she was entitled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> For the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> reason assigned by <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> for releasing the <rs>Trent</rs> differs from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>At best, therefore, it must be held that <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, as he explains himself, acted from combined sentiments of prudence and generosity, and so that the release of the prize vessel was not strictly necessary or in voluntary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> Secondly &mdash; How ought we to expect these explanations by <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> of his reasons for leaving the capture incomplete to affect the action of the <rs>British Government</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> The observation upon this point which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occurs is, that <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>'s explanations were not made to the authorities of the captured vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>If made known to them they might have approved and taken the release upon the condition of waiving a judicial investigation of the whole transaction, or they height have refused to accept the release upon that condition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> But the case is not <num value="1">one</num> with them, but with the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It we claim that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> ought not to insist that a judicial trial has been lost because we voluntarily released the offending vessel out of consideration for her innocent passengers, I do not see how she is bound to acquiesce in the decision that was thus made by us without necessity on our part and without knowledge of conditions or consent on her part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The question between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and ourselves, thus stated, would be a question not of right or of law, but of favor conceded by her to us in return for favors shown by us to her, of the value of which favors on both sides we ourselves shall be the judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Of course the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could have no thought of raising such a question in any case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> I trust that I have shown to the satisfaction of the <rs>British Government</rs> by a very simple and natural statement of the facts and analysis of the law applicable to them, that this Government has neither meditated nor practiced nor approved any deliberates wrong in the transaction to which they have called its attention, and on the contrary that what has happened has been simply an inadvertency, consisting in a departure by the naval officer, free from any wrongful motive, from a rule uncertainly established and probably by the several parties concerned either imperfectly understood or entirely unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>For this error the <rs>British Government</rs> has the right to expect the same reparation that we as an independent State should expect from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> or from any other friendly nation in a similar case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> I have not been unaware that in examining this question, I have fallen into an argument for what seems to be the <rs>British</rs> side of it, against my own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>But I am relieved from all embarrassment on that subject, I had hardly ration into that line of argument when I discovered that I was really defend- <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> ing and maintaining not an exclusively <name>British</name> interest, but an old, honored and churched <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cause, not upon <name>British</name> authorities, but upon principles that constitute a large portion of the distinctive policy by which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have developed the resources of a continent, and thus becoming a considerable maritime power, have won the respect and confidence of many nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> These principles were laid down for us in <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct>, by <persName n="Madison,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="default:Madison,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, when <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, in the administration of <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, in instructions given to <persName n="Monroe,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="default:Monroe,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, our minister to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, although the case before him concerned, a description of persons different from those who are incidentally the subjects of the present discussion, the ground he assumed then was the same I now occupy, and the arguments by which he sustained himself upon it have been an inspiration to me in preparing this reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> <q>&#x0022;Whenever.&#x0022;</q> he says, <q>&#x0022;property found in a neutral vessel is supposed to be liable on any ground to capture and condemnation, the rule in all cases is that the question shall not be decided by the captor, but be carried before a legal tribunal, where a regular trial may be had, and where the captor himself is liable to damages for an abuse of his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Can it be reasonable, then, or just, that a belligerent commander, who is thus restricted and thus responsible in a case of mere property of trivial amount should be permitted, without recurring to any tribunal whatever, to examine the crew of a neutral vessel, to decide the important question of their respective allegiance and to carry that decision into execution by forcing every individual he may choose into a service abhorrent to his feelings, cutting him off from his most tender connections, exposing his mind and his person to the most humiliating discipline, and his life itself to the greatest danger?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Reason, justice and humanity unite in protesting against so extravagant a proceeding.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> If I decide this case in favor of my own Government, I must disavow its most cherished principles, and reverse and forever abandon its essential policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The country cannot afford the sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>If I maintain those principles and adhere to that policy, I must surrender the case itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It will be seen, therefore, that this Government could not deny the justice of the claim presented to us in this respect upon its merits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>We are asked to do the <rs>British</rs> nation just what we have always insisted all nations ought to do to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> The claim of the <rs>British Government</rs> is not made in a discourteous manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>This Government, since its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organization, has never used more guarded language in a similar case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> In coming to my conclusion, I have not forgotten that if the safety of this Union required the detention of the captured persons, it would be the right and duty of this Government to detain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>But the effectual check and waning proportions of the existing insurrection, as well as the comparative unimportance of the captured persons themselves, when dispassionately weighed, happily forbid me from resorting to that defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> Nor am I unaware that <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens are not, in any case, to be unnecessarily surrendered, for any purpose, into the keeping of a foreign State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Only the captured persons, however, or others who are interested in them, could justly raise a question on that ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> Nor have I been tempted at all by suggestions that cases might be found in history where <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> refused to yield to other nations, and even to ourselves, claims like that which is now before us. Those cases occurred when <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, as well as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, was the home of generations which, with all their peculiar interests and passions, have passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>She could in no other way so effectually disavow any such injury as we think she does, by assuming now as her own, the ground upon which we then stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It would tell little for our own claims to the character of a just and magnanimous people, if we should so far consent to be guided by the law of retaliation, as to lift up buried injuries from their graves to oppose against what national consistency and the national conscience, compel us to regard as a claim intrinsically right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> Putting behind me all suggestions of this kind, I prefer to express my satisfaction that, by the adjustment of the present case upon principles confessedly <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, and yet, as I trust, mutually satisfactory to both of the nations concerned, a question is finally and rightly settled between them, which, heretofore exhausting not only all forms of peaceful discussions, but also the arbitrament of war itself, for more than half a century alienated the <num value="2">two</num> countries from each other and perplexed with fears and apprehensions all other nations. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Public sentiment was at once engrossed with the lawfulness and the consequence of such an act, and the impression which has resulted from this has not been for an instant doubtful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> The fact has appeared so much out of accordance with the ordinary rules of international law, that it has chosen to throw the responsibility for it exclusively on the commander of the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It is not yet given to us to know whether this supposition is well founded, and the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Emperor</rs> has therefore, also had to examine the question raised by the taking away of the <num value="2">two</num> passengers from the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The desire to contribute to prevent a conflict, perhaps imminent between <num value="2">two</num> powers, for which it is animated by sentiments equally friendly, and the duty to uphold, for the purpose of placing the right of its own flag under shelter from any attack, certain principles essential to the security of neutrals, have, after mature reflection, convinced it that it could not, under the circumstances, remain entirely silent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> If, to our deep regret, the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> were disposed to approve the conduct of the <rs>Commander</rs> of the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs>, it would be either by considering <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="nearbymention:Mason,Messieurs,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:Slidell,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> as enemies, or as seeing in them nothing but rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>In the <num value="1">one</num> as in the other case, there would be a forgetfulness extremely annoying, of principles upon which we have always found the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in agreement with us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> By what title in effect would the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cruiser, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, have arrested <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="nearbymention:Mason,Messieurs,,,"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="nearbymention:Slidell,John,,,"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have admitted with us, in the treaties concluded between the <num value="2">two</num> countries, that the freedom of the flag extends itself over the persons found on board, should they be enemies of <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> parties, unless the question is of military people actually in the service of the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> Doubtless it will not be pretended that they could be considered as contraband of war. --That which constitutes contraband of war is not yet, it is true, exactly settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The limitations are not absolutely the same for all the powers; but in what relates to persons, the special stipulations which are found in the treaties concerning military people define plainly the character of those who only can be seized upon by belligerents; but there is no need to demonstrate that <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="nearbymention:Mason,Messieurs,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="nearbymention:Slidell,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> could not be assimilated to persons in that category.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>There remains, therefore, to invoke, in explanation of their capture, only the pretext that they were the bearers of official dispatches from the enemy; but this is the moment to recall a circumstance which governs all this affair, and which renders the conduct of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cruiser unjustifiable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> The <rs>Trent</rs> was not destined to a point belonging to <num value="1">one</num> of the belligerents; She was carrying to a neutral country her cargo and her passengers, and moreover it was in a neutral port that they were taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>If it were admissibly under such conditions, the neutral flag does not completely cover the persons and merchandise it carries, its immunity would be nothing more than an idle word; at any moment the commerce and the navigation of <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> powers would have to suffer from their innocent and even their indirect relations with the <num value="1">one</num> or the other of the belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>These last would no longer find themselves as having only the right to exact from the neutral entire impartiality, and to interdict all intermeddling on his part, in acts of hostility, as <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> They would impose on his freedom of commerce and navigation restrictions which modern international law has refused to admit as legimato!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>And we should, in a word, fall back upon vexations practices, against which, in other epochs, no power has more earnestly protested than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> If the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> would only look on the <num value="2">two</num> persons arrested as rebels, whom it is always lawful to seize, the question, to place it on other ground, could not be solved, however, in a sense in favor of the commander of the can <rs>Jacinto</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>There would be in such case misapprehensions of the principles which makes a vessel a portion of the territory of the nation whose flag it bears, and violation of that immunity which prohibits a foreign sovereign, by consequence, from the exercise of his jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It certainly is not necessary to recall to mind with what energy, under every circumstance, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has maintained this immunity, and the right of asylum which is the consequence of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>It has been our pleasure to record many evidences of the determination of the <rs>Southern</rs> people to declare their independence of the <rs>North</rs>, not only in a political, but in an industrial sense; and every day's observation strengthens us in the belief that the mighty problem involved in the latter is rapidly and successfully working itself out. In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> starting of a new government, there was nothing more difficult than to produce a satisfactory issue of paper currency; for art had never developed itself here sufficiently to trace on hard metal those beautiful and unstrong lines so essential to a safe and permanent circulating medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>Suffice it to say, that the notes produced by these accomplished artists are done in the very highest style of excellence, and will defy the skill of the counterfeiter, let him be ever so ingenious.
