<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Whether, on the whole, the world is really advancing, is a question which admits of much being said on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName>'s picture of <name>English</name> progress would lead us to decide that question in the affirmative, as far as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He tells us, that could <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> the <genName n="2">Second</genName></persName>'s reign be set before <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> now, they would not know <num value="1">one</num> landscape in a <num value="100">hundred</num>, or <num value="1">one</num> building in <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>She had then but little more than <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of inhabitants; the annual revenue of the <name>Crown</name> was about &#x00A3;<num value="1400000">1,400,000</num>; agriculture was in a rude and imperfect state; <address><street n="St. James's Square">St.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>James's Square</street></address> was a receptacle for dead cats and dogs; the streets of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> were involved in such profound darkness as to make walking dangerous; the roads in the country were bogs and sloughs, in which carriages were often swamped unless they had <num value="6">six</num> horses; sixpence a day was paid the weaver at the loom; children of <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> old were thought fit to labor in the clothing trade; meat was so dear that it is estimated by <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>, that of the <num value="880000">880,000</num> families of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, <num value="440000">440,000</num> only ate animal food twice a week, and the remainder ate it not at all, or at most <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> not oftener than once a week; the great mass of the nation lived almost entirely on rye, barley and oats; the paupers and beggars were estimated at <num value="1330000">1,330,000</num> out of a population of <num value="5550000">5,550,000</num>, as great as it is at present, with a population <num value="4">four</num> times as large; the rate of deaths in the capital was <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="23">twenty-three</num>, now it is <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="40">forty</num>; men died faster in the country than they do now in towns; noblemen had not the comforts which are now common to their servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But if it be contended that these were still good times, morally, socially and intellectually, let us bear in mind some further facts related by our historian.--He tells us, what indeed has ever since been matter of world-wide notoriety, that in those days extravagant licentiousness prevailed, and that woman was morally and intellectually degraded; the profligacy of the <rs>English</rs> plays, satires, songs and novels, far exceeded the most disgusting productions of <persName n="Sue,,Eugene,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Sue,Eugene,,,"><foreName>Eugene</foreName> <surname>Sue</surname></persName> and his obscene disciples; the poets rejoiced to put their loosest and most indecent verses into the mouths of women, to be repeated at the theatres; husbands of station beat their wives without compunction; statesmen, without giving scandal, could easily accumulate princely estates; the most savage intemperance of party spirit prevailed; blood could not flow fast enough to satisfy the thirst for political revenge; <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whigs</rs> hooted at Tory victims and Tories at <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whigs</rs> as they passed on to execution; there was no daily paper in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; few of the gentry had libraries as good as <name>English</name> footmen now possess; female education was almost entirely neglected; the poetry and eloquence of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> were not familiar even to accomplished gentlemen; men were pressed to death for refusing to plead and women burned for coining; moss troopers and robbers so abounded in parts of the kingdom that the gentry and larger farm-houses were fortified, and parishes were obliged to keep blood-hounds for the purpose of hunting freebooters, while there were portions of the metropolis in which the warrant of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> could not be executed without the aid of a body of armed men. And yet, may it not be too soon to accept this picture of <persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName> as decisive of the question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There are social anomalies in her civilization which remain to be solved, and which may yet perplex and confound the master spirits of the age. It remains to be seen whether the bulk of her population are always going to drudge from morn till night for bare necessities of life, and with all the intellectual and moral differences which this implies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We have seen a nation which had made more rapid progress than <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> come suddenly to grief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> How long is it since the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> spoke thus admiringly of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> progress? &#x0022;In an interval of little more than half a century it appears that this extraordinary people have increased above <num value="5">five hundred per cent</num> in numbers; their national revenue has augmented near <num value="7">seven hundred per cent.</num>, while their expenditure has been increased little more than <num value="4">four hundred per cent.</num> The prodigious extension of their commerce is indicated by an increase of near <num value="5">five hundred per cent.</num> in their imports and exports, and <num value="6">six hundred per cent.</num> in their shipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The increased activity of their internal communications is expounded by the number of their post-offices, which has been increased more than a <num value="100">hundred</num>-fold, the extent of their post roads, which has been increased <num value="36">thirty-six</num> fold, and the cost of their <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, which has been augmented into a <num value="72">seventy-two</num>-fold ratio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The augmentation of their machinery of public instruction is indicated by the extent of their public libraries, which have increased in a <num value="32">thirty-two</num> fold ratio, and by the creation of school libraries, amounting to <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num> volumes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> &#x0022;They have completed a system of canal navigation which, placed in a continuous link, would extend from <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7001523" n="1.000 1" reg="calcutta,west bengal,bharat,asia">Calcutta</placeName>, and a system of railways which, continuously extended, would stretch from <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to <persName n="Dicman,,,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Dicman,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Dicman</surname></persName>'s Land, and have provided locomotive machinery by which that distance would by traveled over in <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, at the cost of <measure n="1.5d." type="currency"><num value="1.5">one and a half</num> pence</measure> per mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They have created a system of inland navigation, the aggregate tonnage of which is probably not inferior in amount to the collective inland tonnage of all the other <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> countries in the world; and they possess many hundreds of river steamers, which import to the roads of water the marvellous celerity of roads of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They have, in fine, constructed lines of electric telegraph, which, laid continuously, would extend over a space longer by <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure> than the distance from the <rs>North</rs> to the <name>South Pole</name>, and have provided apparatus of transmission by which a message of <num value="300">three hundred</num> words, dispatched under such circumstances from the <name>North Pole</name>, might be delivered in <hi rend="italics">writing</hi> at the <name>South Pole</name> in <num value="1">one</num> minute, and by which, consequently, an answer of equal length could be sent back to the <name>North Pole</name> in an equal interval.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Who can pretend to say that a blight as sudden and dismal as that which has come upon this luxuriant prosperity may not <num value="1">one</num> day throw <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> centuries back in the march of progress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Yet, there is high authority for a more hopeful view of human affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>An able <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scottish</rs> writer informs us that he once asked M.Guizot, who, for many years, was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> minister of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, who had lived through some of the most interesting and troubled periods of human history, who had studied men contemplatively, as well as acted with them and governed them,--what feeling was strongest in his mind as he looked back and looked forward &mdash; hope or despondency for his country and the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The reply of this sagacious philosopher and statesman was: &#x0022;I do not feel that my experience of man has either disposed me to think worse of them, or indisposed me to serve them; nor, in spite of failures which I lament, of errors which I now see and acknowledge, and of the present gloomy aspect of affairs, do I despair of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>On the contrary, I hope; I see glimpses of daylight; I see elements of rescue; I see even now faint dawning of a better day. The truth I take to be this: The march of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> is so slow, and our desires are so impatient &mdash; the work of progress is so immense, and our means of aiding it so feeble,--the life of humanity is so long, and that of individual man so brief, that what we see is often <hi rend="italics">only the ebb of the advancing wave;</hi> and thus discouragement is our inevitable lot. <hi rend="italics">It is only history that teaches us to hope.&#x0022;</hi> Let us trust, if we can, that <persName n="Guizot,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Guizot,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Guizot</surname></persName> may be right, and that man is not a pendulum, constantly vibrating between the opposite extremes of civilization and barbarism. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Nothing can be more noble than the conduct of the <name>Women</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> during this war. Always giving them credit for the highest womanly virtues and graces, for refinement of manners, and purity and warmth of heart, we had not been prepared for the exhibition of such qualities as the mothers and wives of this people have displayed under the most terrible ordeal to which civilized and <name>Christian</name> humanity was ever subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Even the glories of our victorious battle-fields are surpassed by the moral sublimity of the self-sacrifice which has been quietly made in every Southern home when the mother placed upon the altar of battle the dearest object of her heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Man may fight from the belligerent instincts of manhood, from ambition and love of excitement, as well as patriotism, but when the mother, gentle and unambitious, gives up her child to the privations and perils of war, it is such a sacrifice of all maternal instincts at the shrine of duty that we can only liken it to the supernatural faith of the patriarch <rs>Abraham</rs>; and every Southern home, where such a scene has been witnessed, to that <placeName key="possibilities=22" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mount Moriah</placeName>, where, rather than to the long line of <persName n="Judah,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Judah,nomatch:0"><surname>Judah</surname></persName>'s heroes, every <persName n="Israel,IsFather,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Israel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsFather">son of</roleName> <surname>Israel</surname></persName>'s looks, as to that which gave birth and immortality to the chosen people of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>No greater miracle has this war presented than the <rs>Gentle Doves</rs> of our summer land, seemingly only fitted for summer scenes, transformed into eagles,&#x0022;queens of the cliff and the wave, flapping the wild wing in the winter sky,&#x0022; and teaching their young to battle with the thunder and the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Nor is it to their own sons alone that the overflowing devotion of their nature has been manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>What house is there in all the land which has not sheltered the sick and wounded soldier?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In the poor stranger at the gate, dusty, battle-worn and bleeding, the <rs>Southern</rs> matron has seen the representative <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> of her own absent son.--In the hospital she has been an angel of light and mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Who can tell the anguish of that weary place,--the anguish of body and mind,--where the only sights the sufferer sees are sights of misery like his own, and the only sounds he bears are moans of pain and dying prayers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The taper that sheds its feeble ray upon the midnight darkness is a type of the fainting hope within his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>What a sense of utter desolation and loneliness hangs like a funeral pall over every couch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The pangs of the maimed and wounded body can be surmounted by the soul, but when the soul itself is maimed and wounded, when the eyes of strangers pierce it with cold, indifferent glances, and the fountains of sympathy that welled up so bright and clear at home are cut off, what earthly power can minister to that mind diseased?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is there that Woman, with her gentle hand upon the cold brow, and her looks of compassion, comes, like a messenger from the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> above, to bind up the broken heart or to plume the pinions of the fainting spirit for a flight to a better world. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The improvement of national morals on this continent is in nothing more evident than that enlightened public sentiment which has come to regard privateering as piracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who has faith in human progress and the perfectibility of the species can contemplate this change without new hopes in humanity and increased confidence in a fact asserted by Galileo-- &#x0022;And yet it moves.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> There is no human thing so perfect that it may not be improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We are apt to suppose that the character of the founders of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic was an exception to this rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Our neutrality has not been founded on any balance of Northern and Southern claims to favor. --Discrimination of that kind has doubtless determined the private sympathies of individuals, but it has not regulated the policy of our Government.
