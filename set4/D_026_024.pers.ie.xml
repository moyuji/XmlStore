<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>A young country is in many respects like a young individual; it must have good models at hand to fashion itself after, and fair opportunities of comparison with other individuals, else it becomes so eccentric, self- conceited, and dictatorial, that all the rest of human kind eschews its companionship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>A boy ought always to go to school, in preference to home education, in order to have chips knocked off his shoulder and the angularities of his nature knocked off by contact with other boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>And a youthful nation must go through the same precess, or it will become so inflated with a sense of its own importance, and so intolerant towards everybody else, that it will become necessary for somebody to take it down, and make it very ridiculous in its own eyes and in those of the world. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The travellers across the great highway have seen but a small proportion of the whole nation, and most of them were commercial travellers, not always the most discerning and philosophical of the human species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>America was young; in many respects, &#x0022;very young,&#x0022; and the <rs>Atlantic</rs> was too immense for her to go across to school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Even if successful, after <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of war, in overrunning a sparse population, what a commentary on the inordinate self esteem which began the war with the confident conviction of ending it in <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>! Even if successful, what will become of the wisest Constitution that the world ever saw, of the freest people, of the model Republic of all ages?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>But if unsuccessful &mdash; if the big booby, who has gone so far for a fight, and jumped so ferociously upon his antagonist, is sprawled in the end by a few cool shoulder hitters, such as <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName> administered to the late <rs>Heenan</rs> &mdash;&mdash; in what corner of the earth will discomfited <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vanity hide its diminished head? </p>
