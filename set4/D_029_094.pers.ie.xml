<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>But it is a fact that <unclear></unclear> <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> of a score or more years existence was, at the <rs>North</rs>, mainly swallowed up in Republicanism in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> and '<num value="60">60</num> and disappeared as such from the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It was actually dead &mdash; could make no war &mdash; and was not charged with it; yet its death put all power in the hands of the party which brought upon the country the issues which terminated in war. The writer of this had been a <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>, and felt the keen pang of mortification at beholding that powerful organization, in which he had put so much faith, melt away, like snow before the sun, and pass into the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs> and the rivers and the subterranean streams.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Supposing that had the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> remained firm, the war might have been, at least, postponed, the regret at its fate was all the more poignant.

<head>High water.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> This phrase we have chosen for a heading to this article, which is devoted to a consideration of high prices, inasmuch as we know nothing better illustrative of the <num value="1">one</num> than the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The rising, whirling and eddying waters cause a great disturbance of the ordinary pursuits of life, and drive people to desperate exertions to save themselves and their effects from being swallowed up. In like manner a community struggles to sustain themselves in the midst of high prices &mdash; to keep their heads above the high-water rates which have invaded and are rapidly submerging everything about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>They retreat from point to point, parting with their movables for safety, until, unencumbered and homeless, they take refuge in the tree-tops and await the falling of the waters! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> The contemplation of that condition of things, in which all the necessaries of life are high, and rents still higher, while occupation is limited and vast numbers of people are without anything to do, is painful enough; to be <num value="1">one</num> of those, laboring under its effects, quite insupportable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>This is the condition of this city at the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The high water prevails, and people are sorely troubled to escape it. Rents are beyond all precedent; even under the <rs>Confederacy</rs> they did not reach the present climax until <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, we believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Landlords could not keep pace with the depreciating Confederate money, and it was only in the latter part of the struggle that they elevated themselves to the extreme indicated by the rapidly falling financial thermometer of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>.</hi> But having gotten at last to this elevation, they seem to be entirely unable to come down; they are like the sailor at the top of the mast &mdash; they cannot safely look down, but keep their eyes towards the horizon across the waste of waters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> Rents are from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="5">five</num> times the reasonable rates which could be sustained by the business of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Immediately after the surrender of the city, speculators and adventurers flocked thither under the impression that there was a field for fortunes here without precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Business stores were scarce, and the demand for them became so great, landlords found that any price they would ask was readily paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Indeed, they often regretted, after renting at enormous prices, that they had not asked more, since others had possibly obtained higher prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The adventurers brought large stocks of goods and exposed them to sale to a community little better than <num value="1">one</num> of paupers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>People beheld the display who had no money to buy. But for the presence of the army, with its disbursements, and the sale of a little tobacco that had been saved, the new-comers' would have sold no goods and taken in no money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The result was that some failed and others left with their goods in disgust, while few that were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the field have remained to endure their disappointment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> Unfortunately for that commercial community which has taken more the appearance of permanent residents, rates are but slightly diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>They have to bear up under the extravagant rents which the adventurers established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Not only are they oppressed with the rents in the business part of the city, but private dwellings are no less expensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Families are compelled, to some extent, still to pursue the economy of sub-renting and room keeping, which was introduced under the refuging and scarcity of the <rs>Confederate</rs> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Board is also dear in proportion to rent, and business and enterprise of all sorts are burthened and straitened in a manner highly injurious to trade, as it must be, under the re-action which will come, to landlords also. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> We know too much of the history of high prices and financial troubles to expect an easy solution of those we now complain of. The remedy must come in due time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The landlord is seldom disposed to reduce the rent to a tenant that <hi rend="italics">is in his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>A failure</hi> and a change of tenants &mdash; the old <num value="1">one</num> going out and the new <num value="1">one</num> coming in, with the advantage of the reduction as a condition precedent to his occupation &mdash; is the only mode in which the change can be well established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>But that the reduction must come is certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The business of this city, nor any city that we know of, save, perhaps, New York, can justify such rents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>If it does not at this time justify it, can we be encouraged by contemplating the future?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Certainly not. There is no tobacco made this year in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and we have absolutely not a single staple article in sufficient abundance for exportation, and cannot have until the ensuing wheat crop, the character of which no man can foretell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>What are to be our resources then in the interim?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>None that we know of, save the money that may flow in by the sale of lands to emigrants, speculators, and mining and manufacturing companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>This would be immense, if the wealth of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> we fully understood among the men who have money to invest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Whether fully appreciated or not, there will be a large incoming revenue from this source, but not in a current sufficiently rapid, nor yet so immediately concentrated in this city, as to authorize or maintain the present high rates of rents and all the articles which support life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>That there must be a great reduction, every <num value="1">one</num> must know, and the sooner we prepare for low water the better. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The great locomotive, <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, it seems, is on the railroad of Destiny, dragging along the <num value="30">thirty</num>-odd cars that pass for States; and woe to him that does not clear the track as it comes thundering on in its irresistible career. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> Now, we take issue with the <rs>Senator</rs> upon the facts involved in his statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We put aside the well-known truth that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> would have cut but a sorry figure in the revolutionary war had she not received the assistance of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, New York, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; and come to events under the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; that is, since <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>And here we take the liberty of saying that, until the late war,--which, it must be acknowledged, she contributed more than any other portion of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to bring about &mdash; she scarcely ever succeeded in anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Even in that war, while her fanatical spirit animated the contest, her individual aid was comparatively small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>She seems to have depended more upon substitutes from foreigners and negroes than upon the valor of her own population, leaving to the <name>Great West</name> and to the <rs>Middle States</rs> the heat and burden of the day, while she contented herself with claiming all the credit, after they had won the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But before that time her success in the <rs>Union</rs> had been absolutely nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>She nominated, it is true, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <rs type="role2">President</rs>; but after <num value="1">one</num> term he was overwhelmed as by an earthquake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Her influence was not felt in the <rs>National Councils</rs> for many years afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The whole policy of the <rs>General Government</rs> was in opposition to her wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Congress put the embargo and non-importation laws upon her, in spite of her remonstrances, protests and furious opposition of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/><milestone unit="column" n="2"/> They ruined half her merchants, and left all her ships rotting at the wharves; but she did not succeed in shaking them off. She opposed the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, and extended her opposition to the verge of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Many think some of her sons actually committed treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>But she could not prevent the war from being declared, nor had she any influence in producing the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>She opposed the tariffs of <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct>, but they passed, in spite of her, and in spite of the gigantic labors of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName>,</hi> the greatest man ever born on her soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>She succeeded in passing the tariffs of <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct> (for her policy had changed); but they were so odious that they nearly produced a separation of the <name>States</name>, and were repealed or compromised away to prevent the actual occurrence of that threatened catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>She succeeded in electing <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>,</hi> but all her efforts could not prevent his utter overthrow <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> after his election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Indeed, the <name>Sons</name> of the <name>Pilgrims</name>, so far from succeeding in all they undertake, failed in every undertaking from the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the opening of those sectional disputes which brought on the late war. Even in these they were foiled for a long time, and very notably in the case of the <rs>Missouri</rs> restriction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> The side to which <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> belonged</hi> succeeded in the late war. The side to which the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> belonged was triumphant at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Some Dutchman actually claimed for his countrymen the credit of having gained the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>This was, of course, an absurdity, but it was not a greater absurdity than the claim of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> to a triumph obtained by the united arms of <num value="24">twenty-four</num> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Besides, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wilson,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName></hi> should reflect that the end is not yet.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> &#x0022;The mania for greenbacks and the high price that cotton has been lately bringing, we fear will induce the planters of the <rs>South</rs> to put too much land in cotton next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The ordinary calculations of prudence and sound reasoning should premonish them against such a policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> Why is it that cotton sells at such enormous prices as now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Plainly because of its scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>And the price will inevitably decline as the production increases.

If this be true, which we do not doubt, a large crop next year, say <measure n="4000000barrels" type="mass">four million bales</measure>, would unquestionably bring down the price to ante-war rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>On the other hand, a crop of half that amount would probably not materially decrease the price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Would it not, then, be better for the people of the <rs>South</rs> to raise only <measure n="2000000barrels" type="mass">two million bales</measure>, which would bring them as much money in the markets of the world as <num value="4000000">four millions</num>?
