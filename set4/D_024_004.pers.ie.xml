The galleries were filled with ladies, and when the <rs>President</rs> appeared the whole hall rang with applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The address was quite a lengthy <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>We give the chief points: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> spoke of his love for the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>He alluded to it, however, as a matter of regret, that the best affections of his heart should have been bestowed upon an object so unworthy &mdash; that he should have loved so long a Government which was rotten to its very core. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> He had predicted from the beginning a fierce war, though it had assumed more gigantic proportions than he had calculated upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>He had predicted war, not because our right to secede was not an undoubted <num value="1">one</num>, and clearly defined in the spirit of that declaration which rests the right to govern upon the consent of the governed, but the wickedness of the <rs>North</rs> would entail war upon the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The present war waged against the rights of a free people was unjust, and the fruit of the evil passions of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>In the progress of the war those evil passions have been brought out and developed; and so far from resulting with such a people &mdash; a people whose ascendants <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> had gathered from the bogs and fens of <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName>--a people whose intolerance produced discord and trouble wherever they went &mdash; who persecuted <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholics</rs>, Episcopalians, and every other sect that did not subscribe to their bigoted and contracted notions.--who hung witches, and did a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other things calculated to make them forever infamous &mdash; the <rs>President</rs> was emphatic in his declaration that under no circumstances would be consent to reunion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> He drew a glowing picture of the horrors of war, and the ravages of the enemy; and while his tears flowed for those who suffered, yet all these would be endured, cheerfully, before our manhood and our liberties would be surrendered. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The war upon Northern soil.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> He alluded briefly to his desire to transfer the war upon Northern soil, but the failure, to do this processed not from a want of inclination but of power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>We were not an old-established nation; with armies and navies at our command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>These had to be improvised from the scanty materials to be found within the limits of our own Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>We were blockaded and cut off from other nations, and everybody knows that we had been an agricultural people, and that our facilities for manufacturing materials of war were extremely limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Notwithstanding this fact, patent to the most casual observer, we had now an army larger than ever before &mdash; our arms and munitions of war were increased in number and improved in quality, and we are in a better condition to day than we were <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Conscription and exemption laws.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> He alluded to the conscription and exemption laws of Congress, explaining the necessity of the </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> <num value="1">one</num> and the intention of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Was sorry to perceive that there had been a false construction put upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>There was no dishonor in being conscripted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The Government had as much right to make laws requiring the services of its citizens in the army as to compel them to work public reads or to pay taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The object of that portion of the exemption law which exempted the owner, agent, or overseas of <num value="20">twenty</num> negroes, was not intended to draw any distinction whatever between classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He benefit was intended to the rich from it. It was simply to provide a police force which Congress thought necessary, and to facilitate the agricultural productions of the country to supply the wants of both the poor people and the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Any law intended to hear unfairly upon the poor even to a feathers weight, would never have received his signature. &#x0022;The poor have fought our battles.&#x0022; says the <rs>President</rs>, &#x0022;and so have the rich&#x0022; The poor in all revolutions are the main stay and grope of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>But while the poor have nobly done their duty, we have no cause to complain of the rich.--All have done well, and many of the wealthiest and most distinguished families in the <rs>South</rs> have sons in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>He instanced <persName n="Welsh,the Honorable,Israel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="default:Welsh,Israel,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Israel</foreName> <surname>Welsh</surname></persName> and others, who had fought as privates in the bloodiest engagements of the war. He thought there might be very properly a revision of the exemption law, and trusted there would be no conflict between Confederate and State laws upon the subject of the military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>That there should be no war with States; and if any State chose to inflict a blow upon the common cause by enacting conflicting military laws, he hoped that <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> would be the last to adopt such a suicidal policy. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Indigent families &mdash; Reserved Corps.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> expressed he gratification at the message of <persName n="Pettus,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Pettus,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Pettus</surname></persName>, and cordially endorsed his views to reference to making provisions for indigent families and the <unclear></unclear> of exempts, who could be ready upon an emergency to go forth and occupy the trenches while the disciplined troops and active soldiery could take the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The calls for such services could be for <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="60">sixty</num>, or <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, and when the emergency had passed they could return to their pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Raw soldiers, the <rs>President</rs> contended could do efficient service in the trenches, and the adoption of such a policy would strengthen our means of defence quite materially. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> In his allusion to the vast numbers of the <rs>North</rs>, the <rs>President</rs> said that upon any fair field we were willing to fight them <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>; we have often whipped them <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>; at <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName> <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> whipped them <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>; but this might not be the case always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>As the enemy progressed in discipline, they approached nearer to our own troops in efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Hence the necessity of providing something like a corresponding force to that which the enemy are bringing against us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> denounced in terms of scathing but dignified rebuke the habit of straggling from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>He invoked public opinion to frown it down and called upon the women to drive the stragglers back to duty. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head>Fill up the ranks.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> He urged the necessity of filling up the thinned ranks of our regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Those veterans who had gone through many hard fought battles looked for their kindred at home to supply the places which had been made vacant by the death of their comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>A brigade which mustered only <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> men, would have to bleed as much as if it had its full quota of <num value="4000">4,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Their ranks must be filled; humanity demands it. It was a time for patriots to throw off the shackles of private interest, fly to the rescue of those herons whom the ravages of war had yet spared, and consecrate themselves to the most sacred cause on earth. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="5"> 
<head>The real Danger.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> remarked that when he arrived here he thought the enemy were pressing down upon us from the <rs>Northern</rs> borders of our State, but when he went to <placeName reg="Grenada, Grenada, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056541">Grenada</placeName> he there learned that nothing could be seen of them but their backs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>They were going back perhaps with the intention of reinforcing the heavy column that was now being thrown down the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>; The real points of attack were at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>; and to all who desired to lend a helping hand to the country in her present exigency he would, any, &#x0022;Go to <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> without delay!&#x0022; </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="6"> 
<head>Necessity of Harmony &mdash; permanent military system.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> He spoke of the salutary effects of harmonious action between the several States and the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and urged upon legislators, both State and Confederate, the necessity of establishing a permanent military system; for even after the present war was ended we might expect trouble from our enemies unless our military establishment was of such character as to give them a wholesome fear of precipitating a war upon us. The true theory was to adopt a military system which would be permanent and operative in times of peace. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="7"> 
<head>The question at issue.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The issue involved in this war was no ordinary ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The question is will you be free, or will you be the slaves of the most depraved and intolerant and tyrannical and hated people upon earth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>This was the real question to be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Everything else was as dust in the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>A people who had demonstrated their utter incapacity for self-government, who have destroyed their own liberties in the vain effort to deprive us of ours, seek to be our masters, and inflict upon us such galling chains as have no parallel in the annals of tyranny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>But our cause is just and vengeance belongs to the <rs>Lord</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Discard all other considerations but the public defence, and victory will again be ours. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="8"> 
<head>Aspersions of the <name>Administration</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> alluded very briefly to the false hoods which had been circulated relative to the <name>Administration</name>, which he could not disprove, because such disapproval would give the enemy a knowledge of things which the good of the cause required to be concealed from him. That he had committed some errors he did not doubt, though they were never the result of improper motives &mdash; For a vindication of himself from the aspersions of some of his follow citizens, he confidently awaited the time when the cause would not suffer from such vindication, he, however, explained the great necessity of public confidence in the officers of the <rs>Government</rs> and pointed to that great and good man <persName n="Johnson,General,Albert,Sidney,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="default:Johnson,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> as a shining example of the ill affects of withholding that deserved confidence which the public welfare require. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> Though the war had somewhat exceeded his expectations, yet he never doubted our final success, and he considered it now as absolutely certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The duration of the war was a question of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He thought, however, it was not possible for a war waged upon such a tremendous seals to be long protracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Be it long or short, however, we could not be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to cry &#x0022;hold, enough.&#x0022; </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>We had a right to expect recognition long since, but it had not come, and his advice was, &#x0022;Put not your faith in princes, nor rest your hopes upon foreign nations.&#x0022; It seemed that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> still refused to take any steps towards either recognition or mediation.

<head>The-Triumphs in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> The Confederate arms have been crowned with most important victories during the past week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>We shall not say that the victory at <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>', gained by <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braston,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, is the most important of the war; but it certainly stands high in the scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It fills the hearts of our Southern people, with gratification, and inspires them with the deepest sense of gratitude to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The victory itself is a grand <num value="1">one</num>--a triumph of inferior numbers over the invading enemy, admirably equipped and confident of bearing down all resistance by the length of his muster rolls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>But when we consider the situation of our cause in the <rs>Southwest</rs>, its value to us cannot be over estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Its affect will be most salutary. --It will add new spirit and new energy to the hearts and hands of our Southern soldiers, and most seriously depress the hopes and diminish the conceit of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>It will put a check upon him, and be a wholesome warning to those ruths as commanders whose brutalities in the cities they have governed, and the country they have traversed, have shocked the world and have disgraced civilisation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>All honor to our brave soldiers whose valor and constantly triumphed in the field of <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' after so prolonged and bloody a struggle against large odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>All honor to their distinguished commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The military events with which he had been connected had not fully borne out public expectation, and this last achievement retrieves the past in the estimation of minds prejudiced by the past, and inspires confidence for the future.-- &#x0022;A little more grape, <persName n="Bragg,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braston,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/><placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' brings back the encouraging words of Old Zack, and we feel that the man those words made famous is indeed the great General the people considered him to be. The cool, deliberate, and practiced artillerist, whose guns were so terrible to the enemy, proves his claim to public confidence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> In the same week which gladdens our people with this brilliant triumph', the successful defence of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> against a powerful land force swells the national joy, and ushers in the new year most suspiciously for our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Assault after assault was made by the enemy, and repaired most successfully by our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Finally, it is to be presumed, discomfited and desponding, he withdrew to his boats, as we learn from the official dispatch of <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The defence of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> has been glorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The advantages of it are great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We keep open our communication with <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and we prevent the enemy from carrying on commerce upon the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>He must, by this time have begun to despair of taking the city either by land or water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> The intrepidity of <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, is spreading terror in the ranks of the enemy and making his situation in divers places most uncomfortable and precarious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> We shall all await with anxiety the further accounts from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/><orgName n="army"><persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> is no doubt demoralized; and it is to be hoped will be greatly out up in its retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The dashing cavalry of <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> is about it and will harass it terribly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> must been an embarrassed situation in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>With Rosecran defeated and the <rs>Federals</rs> at Vicksburg-repulsed, with the waters yet low, and the rivers beset with torpedoes, which have lately given the enemy such fearful proof of their power over the gunboats, he must feel that he is not entirely safe, and begin to look about for a secure retreat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> Indeed, the enemy finds no comfort in reviewing the general situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, after his severs defeat, stands on the <rs>North</rs> bank of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName>, not knowing where to go or what to do; and always to engage the attention of the rabid war party of the <rs>North</rs> by mysterious suggestions touching the future of his operations.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> The field looks bright and cheering to us. It must be full of gloom for the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>He is plunged into greater embarrassment than ever, and his difficulties must increase at home as well as abroad.--His failures in the field will increase the opposition to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and we may anticipate assaults upon it through the press and from the hustings bolder and more scathing than ever.--The Government will not be able to protect itself from them, because the mob no longer stands by it, but keeps it in fear and awe. What this condition of things may bring forth, time must disclose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Certainly nothing can flow from it disadvantageous to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> Bright as the prospect is, there should be no relaxation of measures or energies on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Let us go on with our preparations to meet and beat the enemy just as if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> could raise another army of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of med. If we stand firm and maintain our energy and spirit without abatement, the end is certain, and we may hope, not far off.--Nothing can excite the hope of the atrocious enemy we meet but a falling off in the things that have distinguished us before the world in this war; which may <name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> Among the interesting items of intelligence for which we are indebted to the <rs>Northern</rs> press, is the fact that the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Florida</rs> has succeeded in running the blockade from <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and getting to sea.
