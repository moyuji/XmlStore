<head rend="italics">The <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We have lately published several accounts from intelligent sources which concur in the statement that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts of the misfortunes of that army have been grossly exaggerated; that it has suffered only an inconsiderable loss in numbers, not half that inflicted upon the enemy; that it has still an abundance of artillery, and that the alleged demoralization in the ranks exists only in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>If it be true, as stated by the <orgName n="Columbus Sun" type="newspaper">Columbus <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi></orgName>, that the vigilant <rs>Beauregard</rs> has gone on to take command of that army in person, and that the eminent soldier, <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, will confront <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, the situation in the <orgName n="West and South" type="newspaper">West and South</orgName> is by no means discouraging. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The Southern public ought, by this time, to be able to attach the proper value to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They ought to know that a rigid adherence to facts is not <num value="1">one</num> of their weaknesses. --We once knew an inmate of the hospital for the insane in <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> who had his reason upon all other points except a morbid fear of telling something that was not so. This monomania extended to the most minute and timid matters.--It was a sad infirmity, no doubt, and it is lamentable to think that he may not be wholly rational to this day. <persName n="Stribling,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stribling,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Stribling</surname></persName> has performed many remarkable cures in his time, but this malady is so unusual, so unprecedented among mankind, that it may have baffled even his proverbial skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Certainly, no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> letter- writer is likely to be sent to a lunatic asylum for such a disease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We sometimes question the propriety of transferring to Confederate newspapers <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts of military affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Unhappily, they are often the only accounts that can be promptly obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is, for example, nearly <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> since the <rs n="Battle of Nashville" type="battle">battle of Nashville</rs>, and now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, we begin to get Confederate accounts of that transaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>What dejection, what discouragement, what painful suspense and uncertainty would have been avoided, if we could have heard <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> ago what we hear now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A great disappointment, a great misfortune at the best, but not the irreparable calamity that so many imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, under such leaders as <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> or <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, will still, with the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, retrieve its laurels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>There is no reliance on <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts of the condition of <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Such accounts, and all others, from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sources, when transferred to Confederate columns, should be read as so many <persName n="Gulliver,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Gulliver,nomatch:0"><surname>Gulliver</surname></persName>'s Travels and adventures of <persName n="Munchausen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Munchausen,nomatch:0"><surname>Munchausen</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But a lie when put in type seems to have a stronger fascination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We are prone to believe a thing when in print, that we would have no faith in, in manuscript or by word of mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We should be careful how we put confidence in all we read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The Devil may, after all, have had something to do with <persName n="Faustus,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Faustus,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Faustus</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, under proper leadership, will yet vindicate its claims to the gratitude and admiration of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Its patient endurance of years of toil, peril and adversity, entitles it to as profound respect as the most brilliant <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> successes in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>To be a soldier under generals whose banners are always bathed in the sunshine of victory is a happy fortune; but it affords no such test of constancy and fortitude as the steady and persistent struggle against adverse billows which the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName> has made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>That with discord among officers, changing of generals, incompetent leadership, and consequent defeat and disaster, that army, if composed of any ordinary materials, would long since have been annihilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But it seems to have as many lives as a cat. It rises, like Ant&#x00E6;us, refreshed from its contact with the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It moves forward or it falls back, but it never disappears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It has the muscle and the nerve of a giant, but it needs a head upon its brawny shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Even without a head it has an inextinguishable vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>What might not such energies accomplish under the development and direction of a Lee, a Johnston, a Beauregard? </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName> and other Federal journals give our friend, <persName n="Foote,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>, an indifferent welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The intention which he announced in Congress of &#x0022;seeking some sequestered spot where there is no taxation,&#x0022; is treated by the <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi> with irreverent levity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Certainly that spot is not the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Perhaps <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName> said sequestrated, not sequestered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In that event, <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> is the very man for his money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> We think if <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName> ever expressed any desire in Congress to go to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, it must have been to be sequestrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>That country affords greater facilities for such an object than any other land under the sun. Confederate emigrants who wish to be disposed of in that way have only to call at the captain's office and settle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>, we believe, has considerable property in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which he may be disposed to look after, and <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will help him do it. The <hi rend="italics">Inquirer,</hi> however, does not see the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It thinks that <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName> only desires to be sequestered, and recommends the &#x0022;Old Capitol prison. &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> If this recommendation is carried out, <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>, late of the <rs>Confederate Capitol</rs>, will have made a poor exchange.--We hope they will let the old gentleman pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He has been a good enough Confederate, it is true, and abuse of <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName> does not atone for that crime in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But he is &#x0022;an old man, my lord &mdash; a very old man.&#x0022; He does not want to be sequestered, whatever he may say. Solitary confinement would kill him; or, if shut up with other prisoners, he would talk them to death in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. The idea of <num value="1">one</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journal, that he is to make a tour through <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and hold sweet converse with its inhabitants, would be more humane to him and merciful to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>All the old women in that country would die of vexation from not being able to get a word in. The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> clown, who boasts that he can talk so fast that it takes echo <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> to repeat him, was slow of speech compared with <persName n="Foote,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><surname>Foote</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> On the whole, let us hope that <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName> will go to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is no place for emigrating Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He will find a good many heart-broken exiles in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, who will like to hear the news from their dear country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He can give them the very latest advices, especially upon <num value="1">one</num> point, which vitally touches their sensitive natures &mdash; whether sequestering in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> means sequestration in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press does not exhibit its usual cunning in the jubilation it makes over the reported intention of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to employ negro troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Its rhapsodies have an artificial look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is evident to the most superficial observer that there is nothing it so much dreads as precisely that thing which it pretends to be so glad of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> accounts from Yankeedom represent that the real sentiment upon the subject is very different from that expressed in the newspapers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have often declared that the negro soldiers in their army fight better than their own troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Why, then, should they be delighted with the prospect of having their best troops <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> matched by men of their own color?--They affect to suppose that they will not fight equally well on the <rs>Confederate</rs> side, but they know that stronger motives can be brought to bear on them to fight well on that side than the other.--They pretend to believe that Southern white soldiers will not permit their servants to assist them in defending their lives and property from robbers, burglars and murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>But they are only whistling to keep their courage up. They do not believe a word they say, and are trembling in their <unclear></unclear> at the thing they pretend to laugh at. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The language is not susceptible of any other meaning.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> &#x0022;But it may be remarked that this act gives the power of making the proposed appointments, not to Congress as a body, but to the individual members of the two Houses, and that it is thus in conflict with the spirit and intent of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> clause of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6Section">sixth section</orgName> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which enumerates the privileges accorded to Representatives and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> individually. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> &#x0022;The power to make selections for appointment to office is nowhere accorded in that instrument to the <rs>Senators</rs> and Representatives individually; and it is believed to be an unquestioned principle of constitutional law that no legislation can add to the power vested by the <rs>Constitution</rs> in any member of any <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> Departments of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The power of Congress to vest by law the appointment of inferior officers in the <rs>President</rs> alone, or in the heads of Departments, would seem to include a power to restrict, limit, or partially confer the authority, or to divide it between several Departments, provided they be those which may constitutionally exercise the functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But if the view of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which has been presented be correct, it is clear that the <rs>Congress</rs> cannot vest in itself any right to a participation in the selection of officers of any class save those of the two Houses.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The President"></bibl></cit>
