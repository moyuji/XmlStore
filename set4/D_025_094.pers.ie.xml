<head>The resignation of <persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; his Address.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We give below the speech of <persName n="Robertson,,Wyndham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><foreName>Wyndham</foreName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Delegates</rs> from this city, made in the <rs type="place">House</rs> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, resigning his seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When this popular madness about the maximum shall have been cured, as it will be by the operations of the law proposed to be enacted, the people will look back with grateful pride to the cause of a delegate who has shown the good sense and firmness not to be drawn into the whirling vortex: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> <persName n="Robertson,Mister,Wyndham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Wyndham</foreName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, of the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, said he rose, not without some natural emotion, to exercise, for the last time, his privileges as a member of this body. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The <rs type="place">House</rs> is, perhaps, aware that a meeting was recently held in this city which passed resolutions instructing the city representatives to support the bill to regulate prices, or, if they could not, to resign their seats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The meeting is said to have been a large <num value="1">one</num>; but believing it to be very certain that it was not a majority of the voters of the city, (which alone can authentically speak the voice of the city,) nor probably more than a small proportion of them, I should have felt no difficulty in declining to obey the instructions of a minority or their alternative inviting me to resign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The views, however, which I understand to be held by my co-representatives, and the course they design to pursue, will constrain me to adopt a different course, which I could otherwise have taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I understand my <num value="2">two</num> colleagues to concur in believing that a majority of our constituency is in favor of the bill to regulate prices, and will vote for it, and our <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> to hold the instructions referred to binding, unless there be some action taken by the citizens to show the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A week has now elapsed without any such action having been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is apparent, then, that if the vote were now taken, that I should be placed seemingly, and perhaps, really, in the absence of any counter indication of opinion, in the position of misrepresenting my constituents on a measure of vital importance, by voting against a bill which the <num value="3">three</num> other representatives of the city would, by their votes, declare to be in their opinion a violation of the will of the city to oppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This is a position I prefer not to be placed in. I recognize fully, sir, under our system of Government the duty of the representative to obey the constituent will or resign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Obey that will when it would require me to vote for the bill in question though it were the will of a clear majority, or even of the whole constitutional body, I would not. I view it as a <persName n="Pandora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Pandora,nomatch:0"><surname>Pandora</surname></persName>'s box, full to the brim of evils and suffering to the whole country &mdash; but most of all of calamity and distress unspeakable to this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I will not contribute to lift its fatal lid. My reasons it would not be proper or becoming here and now to enter into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I conclude, therefore, to resign my seat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> I part from you at a moment of great interest &mdash; when the <num value="2">two</num> great antagonistic systems of Force and of Moderation stand face to face, and are about rushing together in fearful conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In my view, the spirit of <placeName reg="Draco, Wise, Texas" key="tgn,2294636">Draco</placeName> seems to inspire the <num value="1">one</num>--the milder genius of <persName n="Solon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Solon,nomatch:0"><surname>Solon</surname></persName> or of <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName> to preside over the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <num value="1">one</num> seems founded on the idea that man's tendency is so strong to rebel against the performance of his public and private obligations, that force and coercion must be perpetually appealed to, to enforce them; the other, that his nature is essentially good, and demands only just treatment to secure from him the general performance of his duties as well to the public as to individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Your impressment bills, your maximums, your bills for excessive and unusual punishment for violently forcing trade, are of the former class, designed to replace the milder system, which is that of our present laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I will not deny but our changed circumstances may call for exceptional modifications of the system of peace; but that the strong coercive system proposed will introduce increased disorder, violence, disappointment, and final failure, I entertain no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It would have been my mission to endeavor to restrain, to quality, to moderate, as far as I could, this system of force &mdash; confident, as I am, that the people will never fail a Government that founds its laws on the presumption that they are, in the main, just, honest, and patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But the hour, the increasing want and unaccustomed privations, make men now impatient and too ready, perhaps, to grasp at anything that may be held out to them as a remedy; and the tide of passion, I fear, threatens to prove too strong for the counsels of moderation, of wisdom &mdash; perhaps, even of justice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister Speaker">Mr. Speaker</rs>, I now close my public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Some <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of it have been devoted to the duties of this hall of Legislature of my native State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I have served here, sir, in our halcyon days of peace and prosperity, when scarce a ripple disturbed the surface of that <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">pacific ocean</placeName> over which the bark of State smoothly glided, or when at most the mock tempests of party alone lashed us into a factitious and transitory excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I was here, too, during that delusive calm--&#x0022;the torrent's smoothness ere it dashed below&#x0022;--which was followed by our being suddenly precipitated into that gulf of whirling trials and troubles with which we have been since struggling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I have been here through all the real and terrible tornado, in the very heart and centre of which we are still whirling and surging amid angry and raging billows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Through all these various seasons &mdash; of sunshine or of storm, of peace or of war &mdash; I have ever found the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName> equal to every occasion and every trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It stood ever well up to the honor and rights of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It prepared and strengthened itself for the coming and inevitable conflict, which it yet wisely, though vainly, strove to avert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>When it came, it threw itself into the contest with a spirit, a manhood, and uncalculating devotion, which left nothing for its friends to desire, nor anything wanting to its fame, and which carried terror and death to the ranks and consternation and dismay to the hearts of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Such has been the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The <hi rend="italics">role</hi> it is now playing I consider the highest, and grandest, and most trying it has yet had to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>On it, in my opinion, more than any other civil power of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, depend the issues of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>On its nerve, its wisdom, its constancy, its forecast, hang mainly the success of our cause &mdash; the achievement of our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I can only trust that now, as heretofore, this representative assembly of the means, and power, and will of the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, will still prove equal to the emergency, and bear her banner triumphantly, as it has ever done heretofore, over all difficulties and through every trial. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister Speaker">Mr. Speaker</rs>, my personal relations with the members of this body have ever been of the most gratifying character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I do not recall an enmity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I do not remember an estrangement to mar the uniform agreeableness of my intercourse with my fellow-members on this floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Examining my own bosom, I do not detect a single trace of unkindness towards any <num value="1">one</num> with whom I have ever served here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>I here formed many and valued friendships, cherished for numbers a cordial regard, respect for all. I hope these sentiments have not been wholly unreturned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It is the sundering of these ties alone that excites a pang of regret in terminating my service here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>All else &mdash; my private tastes, my personal inclinations, and many strong private inducements, besides &mdash; beckon me back to the bosom of my family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>You will believe, sir, these feelings urge me with peculiar force, now, when at the very moment I am addressing you, I have reason to fear that some of my family are enveloped in the hateful folds of the enemy's forces, and some of them fugitives from their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>I now, sir, leave this seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I will say, proudly, without a taint on the honor or fidelity with which it has been filled, I have but <num value="1">one</num> wish, sir, that it may be filled hereafter by some <num value="1">one</num> abler than myself to advance the public good &mdash; by <num value="1">one</num> more anxious to promote it, it cannot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> <persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s remarks were listened to with deep interest, and as soon as he had concluded his friends, taken somewhat by surprise, immediately clustered about him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>All had felt regret at the resignation tendered this morning by the representative from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He was a gentleman whose private qualities and representative abilities were prominently displayed during his connection with this body, and at a time like this, and under the circumstances inducing his resignation, he thought that we should hesitate in parting with so valuable a member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He, therefore, offered a resolution that <persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> be requested to withhold for the present his resignation to this body. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>When asked why he did not move, his excuse was that his men had no rations and he would not fight them without something to eat.--If this prove true he deserved to be cashiered either for having no rations for his men or for not moving forward without them in such an important emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It is very certain (or it should be) that they had something to eat the day before, and it is yet to be seen when Southern soldiers are not ready to move under more trying circumstances than privation of rations for <measure n="24hours" type="date">24 hours</measure>. The neglect of such weighty duties where so much of our interest was involved, hardly admits an excuse, and the shortest way to guard against such dreadful contingencies in future, is to do away, as early as possible, with leaders who have such &#x0022;bad luck.&#x0022; It is to be hoped a better face may be put on the matter than at present shows itself in the countenance of <persName n="Rumor,Madame,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Rumor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madam</roleName> <surname>Rumor</surname></persName> as she travels about camp. </p> </q><bibl n="Savannah Republican"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> The currency is at a fearful depreciation; and mortifying and alarming as the fact may be, the process of depreciation is rapidly going on. A limit to its decline cannot be assigned, unless there be a prompt termination of the issue of new notes, and means devised to reduce the present circulation to an approximation to the actual business wants of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The currency is so largely in excess of what is needed for business purposes that it is distrusted as well as depreciated, and we suffer the consequences inseparable from an inflated circulation &mdash; exorbitant prices, irregular supplies, and general uneasiness and anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>These effects are inevitable from such a condition of the currency, and are remediable only by a rigid process of reduction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Other expedients will be found illusory, if not mischievous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The momentous inquiry presses itself upon us, whether the necessary reduction of the currency can be accomplished, without prejudice to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> in the prosecution of the war. To that end all other considerations should and must yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>A people who value not their lives, in a war for objects above all price, will hesitate at no sacrifice essential to success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The inquiry admits of a solution which dissipates the apprehension, that the expenses of the war, however large the scale on which it may be conducted, need not subject us to a suspected and depreciated currency, and the <rs>Government</rs> finally to repudiation and bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>If our people at home be inspired with confidence in our ultimate triumph, below that which animates our soldiers in the field, and show in a degree only their heroic devotion, the currency may be reduced within safe limits, and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> relieved from dependence upon its own issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It needs only the combined action of the <name>States</name>, their citizens, and their banks and other joint stock companies; and to this they should be impelled by the considerations that supplies will be augmented, prices reduced, and the expenditures of the <rs>Government</rs>, now at a fabulous amount, reduced to limits which may be contemplated without alarm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> The reduction of the currency is harmless to all, except those much in debt, when directed to the withdrawal of what is redundant and in excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The evil supplies, indeed, the means for its easy correction.--Neither occupations nor trade are cramped or incommoded by the operation, since the amount which remains will be sufficient for all business purposes, with the invaluable advantage superadded of security against a financial explosion, which when the circulation is of paper, and excessive in amount, to constantly and justly apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>It may be assumed that the circulation and is now <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure> above the legitimate uses of currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>What it will be a year thence, if we go on as now, stimulated by constantly advancing prices, and the profusion and disorders consequent upon a discredited currency, cannot be estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Economy, prudence, and foresight would dictate the surrender of the whole excess, large as it is, and the more restfully because it is so large, to conflagration, if that were the only mode of getting rid of it, and it were certain it would not return with its plagues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The sufferers would find indemnity for their loss in the appreciation of what remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>With what cheerfulness, then, should the public acquiesce in a plan which provides an immediate and full equivalent for every dollar of currency retired, and commits the <rs>Government</rs> to the limitation of future issues to the wants of trade and commerce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> The plan requires a large sum, but <num value="1">one</num> within the capacity of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, provided the country will yield its assent to the economical and patriotic considerations which back an appeal for an instant and thorough <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> financial reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>the excess of their currency must be admitted to be a fair measure of the ability of a people to contribute to an object of great and pressing public necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> There will, we are induced to hope, be very little opposition to this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>All must feel the necessity of reducing the volume of the currency and stopping further issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>All feel that this cannot be effected unless a large proportion of the outstanding circulation be gathered in. This plan for accomplishing the object is the best that we have yet seen, and it has the very great advantage of having received the endorsement of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>, who will recommend it to Congress. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The Speaker communicated the vote of the <rs type="place">House</rs> to <persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, and he replied, temporarily withdrawing his resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We hope that upon calm reflection, and serious consideration of the very equivocal character of the instructions under which he withdrew, <persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,Wyndham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> will make this withdrawal permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It would be a public calamity to lose at this time the benefit of high talent, large experience, and incorruptible integrity.--From all we have heard of the <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> meeting it was by no means of such a character as to impress us with the idea that those of it who voted the instructions represented <num value="0.2">a <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num></num> part of the constituency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>At any rate, should he finally withdraw, we hope he may be induced to offer again, making the maximum a test question at the polls. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
