<head>Blockade running.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Blockade running has become a regular business in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>So great are the facilities for running merchandize in and out of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and no enormous the profits realized from these ventures, that every <num value="1">one</num> with money to invest wishes to take a hand in the game, and new companies are being established every day with that view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It is therefore high time that the attention of our legislators should be given to the subject; it is <num value="1">one</num> which calls for an early and searching investigation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> There can be no earthly doubt that the business of blockade running, as at present conducted, is doing much permanent injury to our circulation; that the morals of our people are anything but benefitted by it, as it panders to their vices, instead of ministering to their real wants and there is abundant evidence to show that most of the cotton and tobacco which those finds its way out goes into the hands of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> speculators, who flood our markets in return with their poisonous drugs and trumpery &#x0022;notions.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> It is the duty of the <rs>Government</rs> to gather all the facts bearing upon this matter, and to lay them before Congress on the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the approaching session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The injury which the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has already sustained from the abuses of the present system is in calculable, and no time should be lost in devising proper measures for making it what it ought to be, a benefit to us, instead of a <unclear></unclear> curse, which it bids fair to become should its present operations be allowed to go on much longer unchecked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Nothing can be easier than to place this trade under such regulations and restrictions as will, to a great extent, prevent our enemies from deriving all its benefits, without the slightest compensating advantage to our people or Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The suicidal &#x0022;let alone&#x0022; policy has been tried long enough, and we can all perceive with what results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Let a new and well guarded system be inaugurated as speedily as possible; the statesmen by whom such a reform shall be effected will deserve and receive the thanks of the nation. </p> </div3>

<head><rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention &mdash; that <hi rend="italics">ignis fatuus</hi> which was allowed to operate so injuriously to our cause in the beginning of this war, and the probability of which seems as remote as ever &mdash; has not yet lost all its terrors for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, under the date of <dateStruct value="-05-9"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="9">9</day></dateStruct>, thus gives expression to his fears that something of the sort may yet come to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We give his comments upon the subject, without attaching much importance to them, but as an exemplification of the ever-changing currents of public rumor in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> &#x0022;Quiet as everything now seems with regard to <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs, there are many signs of a confidence, amounting to certainly, that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war is not to last much longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The Government is about to employ the people of <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> on <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName>, so that they may not emigrate, but be ready to spin the cotton when it comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A line of steamers of <num value="3000">3,000</num> to <num value="4000">4,000</num> tons is being built expressly to bring cotton from New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><num value="1">One</num>, the <rs>Georgia</rs>, was launched this week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The manufacturers who have not been in any hurry about cotton, satisfied to get off a large manufactured surplus at an advance, are evidently in no trouble about a supply when they need it. They are even building new mills, and filling them with machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I have no doubt that they have an assurance from the very highest quarters that cotton shall be forthcoming at a fixed and not very remote period. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> &#x0022;On what is that assurance based?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>On the ability of the <rs>National Government</rs> to conquer the <rs>South</rs> and open her ports to the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I cannot come to any such conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The southern loan of <measure n="15000000dollars" type="currency">$15,000,000</measure> was not subscribed for, and is not kept at a premium by any such idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There is, beyond reasonable question a general understanding in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and between the <name>Governments</name> of these countries, that if the <rs>South</rs> is not subjugated within a certain period &mdash; and of the probability of such subjugation they have no belief &mdash; her independence is to be acknowledged and guaranteed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They will say &mdash; you have had <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> and the resources of the world to end this rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If you cannot do it in that time, you never can. The war is too great an injury to the commerce of the world to go on for an indefinite period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We must interfere for our own interests, and in the cause of humanity and civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They will say to you as they will to <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, as <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, at least, will say to <persName n="Emanuel,,Victor,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Emanuel,Victor,,,"><foreName>Victor</foreName> <surname>Emanuel</surname></persName>: This has been going on long enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It becomes a nuisance and must be put a stop to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> &#x0022;There is another fact you are not to lose right of. <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, as well as others, have pride of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They are not willing to be found in the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Now, there is scarcely an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> of either of the great parties, from <persName n="Derby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Derby,nomatch:0"><surname>Derby</surname></persName> and <persName n="Palmerston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Palmerston,nomatch:0"><surname>Palmerston</surname></persName>, <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gladstone,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><surname>Gladstone</surname></persName>, down, who have not committed themselves to the success of the rebellion.--There is scarcely an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> of any political reputation who has not expressed, over and over again, the opinion, not to say wish, that the <rs>National Government</rs> can never conquer the rebel States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The Liberal Press &mdash; I mean the <hi rend="italics">Times, <orgName n="Morning Post" type="newspaper">Morning Post</orgName>, <persName n="Review,,Saturday,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Review,Saturday,,,"><foreName>Saturday</foreName> <surname>Review</surname></persName>, &#x0026;c.</hi>--have been as decided and as contemptuous in the matter as the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> or <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName>,</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Press.</hi> The nation, with slight exceptions, is committed in opinions and hopes <num value="1">one</num> way, and it is vain to think they will not &#x0022;back their opinions,&#x0022; or attempt, to realize their hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They look for cheap cotton and free trade from the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and a perpetual checkmate to Northern power and aggression.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Time"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> All this sounds plausible enough, but the present aspect of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> affairs is not very promising of such results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the only power whose sympathies for the <rs>South</rs> have been exhibited in a tangible form, is just now too busy with the <name>Polish</name> and <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> <hi rend="italics">imbroglios</hi>, not to mention her <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> expedition, to think seriously of any move in that direction, unless backed by the moral and material support of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, nor can this support and co-operation be hoped for so long as the <name>Russell</name>-<persName n="Palmerston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Palmerston,nomatch:0"><surname>Palmerston</surname></persName> ministry shall remain in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The liberalism of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is a very shadowy and unsubstantial foundation to build upon, as the <name>Poles</name> have more than once found out to their cost, and as the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs> would also have experienced, but for the bold and vigorous measures of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In the meanwhile, let the <rs>South</rs> rely solely on the goodness of her cause and the devoted patriotism of her sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Let us continue to help ourselves, and <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> will most assuredly take us through the fiery ordeal. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The duration of the war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Some of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers seem much edified with the idea of a <orgName n="Southern Journal" type="newspaper">Southern journal</orgName>, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation are beginning to accept with satisfaction a state of war as their probable condition for the next half century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>That which pleases them in this fanciful notion is, that it implies a vast deal of martial order and persistent pugnacity in their characters; that it gives hope of great profits to contractors, and is calculated to dampen the hitherto and hopeful patriotism of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In all these calculations the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are as wide of the mark as usual. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> What we have never been of those who <unclear></unclear> to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> race the common quality of animal courage, we are as little inclined to believe that they can accept with <unclear></unclear> the condition of war, which interfere with their favorite pursuits of commerce and trade, or <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> that they can persist in it <num value="1">one</num> day after it has ceased to be profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The war of the <name>Revolution</name>, it is true, lasted <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, but that was a wailed by a Southern chieftain and supported by Southern arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The last war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was of brief duration, but, brief as it was, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> illuminated their house and fired their cannon in frantic enthusiasm when peace was declared, although the war left the questions at issue between the <num value="2">two</num>, nations just where it found them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>And if they could now have peace with the <rs>South</rs> on any terms, the great mass of the nation would be electrified with delight, and throw up their hats a good deal higher than they did at the end of the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> We do not predict that this will be a short war; we see no signs of its termination so long as the demagogues and speculators control the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But we simply desire the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to understand that when they talk in a magnificent way of waging this war for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, and when an unguarded admission falls from some individual in the <rs>South</rs> that such may be their honest purpose, <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> out of every <num value="100">hundred</num> of our people regard with equal incredulity and contempt their idle vaporings, and are making up their minds to accept, with fortitude and resignation, war as their natural condition for the remainder of their earthly existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are willing to fight <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>, the <rs>South</rs> is more than willing to fight a <num value="100">hundred</num> rather than be subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The war has now lasted more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, and we are beginning to be accustomed to it. Habit, which is a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> nature, is reconciling us to a condition which we now perceive was inevitable, and could not have been avoided without the deepest degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The war has hardened our nerves and sinews; it has discovered to us our strength; it has developed our industry; it has delivered us from the loathsome and corrupting embrace of a demoralized people, and from the most vulgar and detestable despotism that ever disgraced the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>There was a time at the beginning of the contest when there was not powder enough in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to fight <num value="1">one</num> great battle, nor <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs> enough to supply a single regiment, nor any other arms or munitions of war of either the quantity or quality demanded by the crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had rushed upon us then, we should have been almost at their mercy, but in that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which then restrained them, and has ever since confounded their devices, we see the sure guarantee of our final triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We have now more than arms enough for our wants, and the enemy is farther now than he was a year ago from the coveted prize of his ambition and vindictiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We have, therefore, no fears of any <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prolongation of the war. The longer it continues the stronger we shall grow; and the poorer will the enemy become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Nor will it always be a war of invasion on his part, and of defence on ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>No wonder that he should be reconciled to a long war at other people's doors ! It requires no super-human valor and resolution to attain to that state of mind.
