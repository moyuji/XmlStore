<head>Gold and Federal credit.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> The late intelligence from the <rs>North</rs> shows that gold has begun the mad dance that indicates a panic-stricken public on the subject of the finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>The credit of the <rs>Government</rs>, Federal, is getting unsteady, and men who have amassed capital out of war contracts and otherwise, are inclined to put it in the safest and solidest security &mdash; gold; and the next thing after that, is to transfer the gold to the safest place: viz, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/><persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> has had <persName n="Cisco,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Cisco,nomatch:0"><surname>Cisco</surname></persName> selling gold certificates, to check the advance of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>He sold at <num value="100">100</num> for <num value="164">164</num> when <hi rend="italics">gold</hi> readily brought <num value="169">169</num> in greenbrier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The certificates were receivable in custom house dues; but that did not make them as good as gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Ordinarily in peace times, the certificate would have been better than gold; but not so now. People are not so sure that the <rs>Government</rs> might not put off these certificates, and they do not answer the purpose of immediate and safe hiding away till after the war, or to be used in speculation abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Nay, more than and above all this, they are but the promises of a Government whose national debt is already beyond its ability ever to pay, and therefore do not command public confidence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> The depreciation of Federal credit is already great, and it must continue to grow worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Government may attempt to frustrate the story told by gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>For a time they may affect its oracles so that it may by its variations palter in a double sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>But it will continue to point the alarming downward index, showing the way of a rapidly depreciating and really an irredeemable paper currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The very latest news, indeed, exhibits some efforts at improvement &mdash; gold goes down a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Yet it will not be kept down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It will rise again and drive the <rs>Government</rs> to new and fruitless expedients to check its startling developments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>We shall not be surprised to see the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> resorting to many of the exploded measures for forcing people into a belief in its credit, for compelling confidence to fill her pockets with its promises to pay in preference to gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>But the result will be the same that it always has been. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> It is very probable that <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> has a presentiment of the course his gold would take if he sent any more to <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address>, as he resorted to the gold certificates instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>He no doubt foresaw that all the gold he might sell would likely be placed on special deposit in some foreign bank within <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> Nothing can enable the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government to pay its enormous debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>If the <rs>South</rs> were even subjugated it would be unable to do so out of all the property it might seize in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who will reflect upon the subject can see how utterly fallacious must be all hopes of realizing any considerable sum from the property of the <rs>South</rs> amidst the rain &mdash; the hopeless desolation &mdash; that must prevail in the event of her subjugation by this war. The very officials who were charged with the duty of converting this property into money would combine with the hordes which would spread over the land to rob and defraud the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Its revenues from this source would dissolve into nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The machinery for the <rs>Government</rs> and the spoliation and confiscation of the <rs>South</rs> would sweep all the income that it could extort from an irretrievably ruined land, and the <rs>Northern States</rs> would be compelled to bear the terrible burthen of debt which the war will have left them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>They would never pay it. They, too, would rebel, and there would be another war to desolate the <rs>North</rs> as well as the <rs>South</rs>, and in which the cup of retribution would be drained to the dregs by the heartless people now waging war against these States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> But the <rs>South</rs> will never be subjugated.--The war must continue to be a futile <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>It may continue some time yet. But the <rs>South</rs> must triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>As time passes away the <rs>Northern</rs> hopes of making us pay their debt must diminish, while the debt itself dwells in geometrical progression like a ball of snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The effect of this sort of sliding scale upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind is already perceptible, and must go steadily on, as a few months will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The gold thermometer will exhibit it, notwithstanding the efforts to influence it to speak falsely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>These efforts are only partially successful at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>After a time, however, there will be a breaking away from the power of the <rs>Government</rs>, just as when a dam falls and there is no power to stop the water it enclosed, and it will be given up to take its course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> The debt of the <rs>South</rs> is large, but small compared with that of the <rs>North</rs>, while the resources of the <rs>South</rs> are inferior to those of no nation on the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>If the war is not prolonged to a period greater than most people anticipate, the <rs>South</rs> will be able fully to redeem her credit before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The <rs>North</rs> never can, in no possible event.
