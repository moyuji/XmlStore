<head>Taking the back Track.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, a few weeks ago, undertook to defend the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> upon <placeName reg="Scriptural grounds">Scriptural grounds</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This indiscretion so roused the ire of <placeName reg="Hector Hall">Hector Hall</placeName> that the <name>Thunderer</name> hastened to undo the mischief it had done by the defence in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It now professes to be greatly horrified at <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00326" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Gen,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s threat of retaliation for the coldblooded murders that have been perpetrated upon our people, and lectures the <rs>South</rs> in the following strain: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> &#x0022;The South should remember that they were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to draw the sword in this quarrel; that they rose against an established Government in the exercise of its legal functions; that they obtained by the agency of traitors in that Government a considerable supply of arms and money; and <hi rend="italics">that that Union which they such to dissolve is as events have proved, the dearest wish of every <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> heart!!!</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> Had we never heard of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> before we should certainly have attributed this paragraph to some <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, allowed, for the time, to take his meat upon the triped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>We should have believed it impossible for anybody but a scion of that ingenuous nation to have manufactured such a compound of falsehood, malignity, and absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>But we are well acquainted with the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> and long accustomed to its habit of eating <hi rend="italics">humble pis</hi> whenever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>It finds that it has made a false calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The great &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Thunderer</hi>&#x0022; is as fearful of expressing an unpopular opinion, and as ready to recant it when once expressed, as any little village sheet that lives upon the smiles and subscriptions of a few score of patrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>This wholesale recantation of all it has said in <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> takes us not, therefore, by surprise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> The lordly air with which the recantation is made, is, nevertheless, quite edifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>It takes all the points in dispute, gives the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> view of the case, and then boldly asserts that <hi rend="italics">we</hi> have all along admitted that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> view to be the correct view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It is very easy to settle a dispute by begging the whole question, if the party upon whom this method of arguing is practiced is willing to submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>This is not exactly the humor of the <rs>South</rs> in the present instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>For example, the <rs>South</rs> does not &#x0022;remember that it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to draw the sword in this quarrel.&#x0022; No man can &#x0022;remember&#x0022; what he never knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>No man can tax his memory with a truth which never had any existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The South does not remember that &#x0022;it rose against an established Government in the exercise of its legal functions,&#x0022; because it never did any such thing &mdash; It withdrew from a Union which sought to oppress it, as it had a perfect right to do &mdash; some of the <name>States</name> (<placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> especially) having reserved the right to withdraw at their own pleasure, before joining it, and having been received notwithstanding such reservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It rose against a Government which was exercising, not its legal powers, but powers that were not only not granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs> but were never dreamed of by those who framed that Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The South did not obtain, by means of traitors in &#x0022;that Government,&#x0022; arms, money, &#x0026;c. The letter of <persName n="Buchanan,ex-President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00327" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="ex-President">ex- President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> settles that matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>He says the <rs>South</rs> did not get all the arms they were entitled to. The South do not know that &#x0022;the <rs>Union</rs> which they are seeking to dissolve is still the dearest wish of every <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> heart.&#x0022; They know that if it were so, nobody would be now seeking to dissolve it, taking it for granted, as the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> does, that it still exists, which it has told us a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times that it did not. They know that <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> are in arms to resist it.--They know that <num value="50">fifty</num> battles have been fought to prevent it. They know <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> lives have been lost in the effort to restore it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> But we are ashamed of treating such absurdities seriously, and should not do it, were it not for the hope of disabusing the minds of all such as still continue to hope for peace through intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The British Government conceives itself to have an interest in letting this quarrel run its course.--Its fears, also, to restrain it. It dare not encounter the enmity of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>This same <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> during the <name>Crimean</name> war, talked magniloquently of &#x0022;throttling the <rs>Northern</rs> giant with <num value="1">one</num> hand, and chastising the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with the other.&#x0022; It holds a different language now. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>His Abolition proclamation, which he looked to as his last grand card, has already begun to recoil upon himself, and the instruments he is choosing to carry it out, we confidently believe, will hasten the catastrophe of his sinking fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Let us oppose calmness and courage to this last mad onset of a demented party, and it will be broken into such fragments beyond the power of reconstruction.
