<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --Total Destruction of a City and Awful Loss of Life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> A letter from <placeName key="tgn,2033971" n="1.000 12" reg="valparaiso, porter, indiana">Valparaiso</placeName>, <date value="04-02">April 2d,</date> gives the following account of the destruction of the city of <placeName reg="Mondoza">Mondoza</placeName>, and the attendant frightful scenes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> With feelings of deep regret I have to announce to you the utter destruction of the city of <placeName reg="Mendoza, Caldwell, Texas" key="tgn,2105990">Mendoza</placeName>, in the <placeName reg="Argentina" key="tgn,7006477">Argentine Republic</placeName>, by an earthquake, on the evening of the <date value="03- 20">20th of March</date> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>At that date, at <time value="8:30">half-past 8</time> P. M., a alight but prolonged vibration of the earth was felt in this city and in <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Santiago</placeName> simultaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Most of the churches were densely filled, it being near the close of Lent, and some alarm and conclusion was created, but no serious accidents occurred, and tranquility was soon restored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> On <date>Sunday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--24"><day reg="24">24th</day></dateStruct>, however, a general gloom was cast over this city by the announcement by telegraph from the capital that Benigno Bruno, the mail rider, had arrived from <persName n="Mendoza,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Mendoza,nomatch:0"><surname>Mendoza</surname></persName> that morning without a mail, bringing the distressing news that there remained but a heap of ruins to point the spot where, a few days before, had stood a thriving and populous city of <num value="15000">15,000</num> souls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Bruno stated that he arrived at <persName n="Mendoza,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Mendoza,nomatch:0"><surname>Mendoza</surname></persName> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct>, that at <time value="8:30">half-past 8</time> P. M., a brief but excessively violent shock of earthquake, lasting but <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8seconds" type="date">eight seconds</measure>, destroyed every building, public and private, in the city, and that the number who were unabled to escape was very limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The streets being narrow, the buildings high, and the inhabitants totally unused to such phenomena, were paralyzed with terror, and neglected, to seek refuge in the open courts of their dwellings until too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The Postmaster was buried beneath the ruins of the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">Post-Office</orgName>, the <rs>Governor</rs> was missing, and when asked why he brought no certificate that the mails were lost the messenger replied, <q>&#x0022;There was no <num value="1">one</num> left to write it, nor materials to write with.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The aspect presented by the city after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shock was terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Hoarse subterranean thunders deafened the air, animals of all kinds rushed frantically through the open spaces howling, the earth opened and vomited forth floods of water, while, to crown the scene of horror, flames burst from the ruins and consumed nearly the entire business portion of the city, with its dead, its dying and its wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> On the <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="2">28th</day></dateStruct> a number of letters were received here and at <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Santiago</placeName> by relatives and friends of Chileans residing in <persName n="Mendoza,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Mendoza,nomatch:0"><surname>Mendoza</surname></persName>, but the hope, until then entertained, that the earlier accounts were exaggerated, soon gave way to the dreadful certainty that the calamity had not yet been painted in colors sufficiently vivid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The earth still continued to tremble, the few walls that had resisted the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shock <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> fell, until now no vestige of a building remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The mountain roads are in a most dangerous condition, not only on account of the huge masses of rock that have already fallen and obstructed the road, but because the vibration of the earth is still hurting them down from the heights above into the valleys. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The <hi rend="italics">gauchos,</hi> or natives of the surrounding country, hastened to the spot, not to assist the needy or aid in reaching the wounded from a lingering death, but to seek for plunder among the smoking ruins, and to snatch the little saved from the wretched survivors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The gentleman writing from thence, after describing these horrors, says: <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;I believe that in a few days we shall have no other law here than that of the poignant.&#x0022;</q><bibl n="The gentleman"></bibl></cit> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The prison was destroyed; out of <num value="100">one hundred</num> inmates, <num value="92">ninety-two</num> perished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The remaining <num value="8">eight</num>, who were already hardened villains, formed themselves into a band of free looters, and had gone, it was supposed, to the mountain passed, to intercept and rob the parties sent from <placeName key="tgn,1000049" n="1.000 3" reg="chile, south america">Chile</placeName> for the relief of the sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><num value="1">One</num> woman was found robbed and murdered by the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>She was recognized as <num value="1">one</num> who was on her way to <persName n="Mendoza,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Mendoza,nomatch:0"><surname>Mendoza</surname></persName> to see her family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They, too, had all perished on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="2">20th</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> In the <orgName n="Jesuit Church" type="church">Jesuit Church</orgName> there was preaching that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The services had just concluded, and the congregation was about dispersing, when the shock came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The few who had reached the plaza were saved, but the walls and roof of the building fell inward with a crash, and priest and penitent together were hurried into eternity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The latest advices from <persName n="Mendoza,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Mendoza,nomatch:0"><surname>Mendoza</surname></persName> represent the suffering to be extreme, there being neither food, clothing nor shelter for the survivors, everything being buried beneath the ruins. --They also state that <placeName key="tgn,7005859" n="1.000 9" reg="san juan,san juan,puerto rico,north and central america">San Juan</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Luis</placeName>, <num value="2">two</num> other populous cities of the <name>Confederation</name>, have shared a like fate, the <placeName key="possibilities=12" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Juan river</placeName> having, after the shock, left its bed, and swept over the town, utterly destroying what the earthquake had spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This news not having been fully confirmed, I do not, however, vouch for its correctness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> As soon as this disastrous news was rendered beyond question, the <rs>Government</rs> and private individuals vied with <num value="1">one</num> another in energetic efforts to send immediate relief to their suffering brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Without waiting for the completion of the work, on the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> a party of physicians and others left for the scene of the disaster, bearing medicines, food and clothing, and accompanied by a small body of troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The gloom and terror spread throughout the republic of <placeName key="tgn,1000049" n="1.000 3" reg="chile, south america">Chile</placeName> by this awful calamity may be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Situated upon an eminently volcanic region, we have constant evidence of the insecurity of our tenure of existence.--Separated but by a chain of mountains from the scene of destruction, and taught by sad experience the frightful and irresistible force of the unheralded earth storm, we retire each night with a feeling of terrible insecurity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This coast has been frequently visited, in past years, by earthquakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Chilean has been twice destroyed: Conception once, while <placeName key="tgn,2033971" n="1.000 12" reg="valparaiso, porter, indiana">Valparaiso</placeName>, <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Santiago</placeName> and Coptapo have suffered severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>No amount of human foresight, no precaution, avails against the mysterious visitor, who comes at dawn, at noonday or at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, and, in a few seconds, levels to the ground the proudest monuments of human skill. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Were it not that I have all the particulars in this case from such responsible military authority as leaves no room for doubt, I could not have been induced to give it to your readers as a fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>About <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago a daring spirit formed the rash determination to spike the guns of <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He was a resident of <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, and knew every inch of <placeName reg="Santa Rosa Island, Santa Rosa, Florida" key="tgn,7021608">Santa Rosa Island</placeName>, while he was perfectly familiar, from numerous visits, with the interior of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Fired with patriotism and ambition, a stranger to such a feeling as that of fear, hope became father to the wish with him, and he resolved to carry out his desperate plan without consulting a soul or letting any <num value="1">one</num> into his confidence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Provided with a bag containing his hammer and nails, he took a sail-boat, and was soon landed in the <rs>Live-Oak Woods</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This was previous to the reinforcement of <persName n="Pickens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Pickens,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickens</surname></persName>, and when <placeName reg="Santa Rosa, Sonoma, California" key="tgn,2014133">Santa Rosa</placeName> was entirely deserted and unwatched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>During a dark and stormy night, therefore, he found no trouble or difficulty in approaching the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Awaiting his opportunity, he got into a barbette battery, and thrust <num value="1">one</num> of his nails into the vent of a <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pounder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Just as he raised his hammer to drive in the spike, he felt a hand laid upon his shoulder, and heard the words, <q>&#x0022;You are my prisoner.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> It was a young officer that had seen him get into the battery, and, creeping up behind, caught him in the very act of spiking the gun. But our hero had not failed to take into consideration such a contingency as this, and in the next <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> the point of his long knife was at the breast of the officer, and he said, in a tone not to be misunderstood, <q>&#x0022;You are my prisoner, and if you utter <num value="1">one</num> word you are a dead man!&#x0022;</q> That the officer was rather amazed at finding he had caught a Tartar can be easily understood; nor is it to be wondered at that he readily agreed to let the intruder depart in safety, with a warning not to repeat his rash attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Any <num value="1">one</num> would suppose that such an experience as this would satisfy the bravest man, but it was not so with our hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>A few nights after he again tried to get into the fort, with his hammer and spikes, and was made a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Carried before <persName n="Slemmer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Slemmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Slemmer</surname></persName>, he boldly avowed the purpose of his visit, and asserted his readiness to accept the penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Now, however, the officer who had before detected him generously interfered in his behalf, and told the story.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> It is difficult for <num value="1">one</num> who has arrived so recently in this country, and who has been subjected to such a variety of statements, to come to any very definite conclusion in reference to the great questions which agitate it. But as far as I can I shall form my opinions from what I see, and not from what I hear; and as I shall proceed South in a few days, there is a probability of my being able to ascertain what is the real state of affairs in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>As far as I can judge &mdash; my conclusion, let it be understood, being drawn from the prevailing opinions of others--<q>&#x0022;the <rs>South</rs> will never go back into the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022;</q> On the same day I heard a gentleman of position among the <orgName n="Southern party" type="party">Southern party</orgName> say, <q>&#x0022;No concession, no compromise, nothing that can be done or suggested, shall induce us to join any Confederation of which the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States are members;&#x0022;</q> and by another gentleman, well known as <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest of the <name>Abolitionists</name>, I was told, <q>&#x0022;If I could bring back the <rs>Southern States</rs> by holding up my little finger, I should consider it criminal to do so.&#x0022;</q> --The friends of the <rs>Union</rs> sometimes endeavor to disguise their sorrow and their humiliation at the prospect presented by the <orgName n="Great Republic" type="newspaper">Great Republic</orgName>, under the garb of pride in the peculiar excellence of institutions which have permitted such a revolution as secession without the loss of <num value="1">one</num> drop of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>But concession averts bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>If I give up my purse to the footpad who presents a pistol at my head, I satisfy all his demands, and he must be a sanguinary miscreant if he pulls the trigger afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The policeman has, surely, no business to boast of the peculiar excellence, in such a transaction, of the state of things which allows the transfer to take place without bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>A Government may be so elastic as, like an overstrained India-rubber band, to have no compressive force whatever, and that very quality is claimed for the <rs>Federal Government</rs> as excellence by some eminent men whom I have met, and who maintained the thesis that the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">U. S. Government</orgName> has no right whatever to assert its authority by force over the people of any State whatever; that, based on the consent of all, it ceases to exist wherever there is dissent &mdash; a doctrine which no <num value="1">one</num> need analyze who understands what are the real uses and ends of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The friends of the existing Administration, on the whole, regard the <name>Secession</name> as a temporary aberration, which a <q>&#x0022;masterly inactivity,&#x0022;</q> the effects of time, inherent weakness, and a strong reaction, of which they flatter themselves they see many proofs in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, will correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><q>&#x0022;Let us,&#x0022;</q> they say, <q>&#x0022;deal with this matter in our own way. Do not interfere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>A recognition of the <name>Secession</name> would be an interference amounting to hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In good time the violent men down <placeName key="tgn,2681709;tgn,2681713;tgn,2076427" n="0.140 000000.8392	placename;tgn,2681709;south river, georgia, georgia,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.035 000000.2098	placename;tgn,2681713;south river, virginia,Rockbridge,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.035 000000.2098	placename;tgn,2076427;tgn,2076724;roseboro, sampson, north carolina;south river, carteret, north carolina,Carteret,North Carolina,United States,North and Central America" reg="south river, georgia, georgia,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;south river, virginia,Rockbridge,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;tgn,2076724">South</placeName> will come to their senses, and the treason will die out.&#x0022;</q> They ignore the difficulties which <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> States may feel in refusing to recognize the principles on which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were founded when they find them embodied in a new Confederation, which, so far as we know, may be to all intents and purposes constituted in an entire independence, and present itself to the world with claims to recognition to which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, at least, having regard to precedents of <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> governments, could only present an illogical refusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The hopes of other sections of the <name>Northerners</name> are founded on the want of capital in the slave States; on the pressure which will come upon them when they have to guard their own frontiers against the wild tribes who have been hitherto repelled at the expense of the whole Union by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops; on the exigencies of trade, which will compel them to deal with the <rs>North</rs>, and thereby to enter into friendly relations and ultimate re-alli- ance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>But most impartial people, at least in New York, are of the opinion that the <rs>South</rs> has shaken the dust off her feet, and will never enter the portals of the <rs>Union</rs> again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>She is confident in her own destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>She feels strong enough to stand alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>She believes her mission is <num value="1">one</num> of extension and conquest &mdash; her leaders are men of singular political ability and undaunted resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>She has but to stretch forth her hand, as she believes, and the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> becomes an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> lake closed by <persName n="Cuba,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Cuba,nomatch:0"><surname>Cuba</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The reality of these visions the <rs>South</rs> is ready to test, and she would not now forego the trial, which may, indeed, be the work of years, but which she will certainly make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>All the considerations which can be urged against her resolves are as nothing in the way of her passionate will, and the world may soon see under its eyes the conflict of <num value="2">two</num> Republics founded on the same principles, but subjected to influences that produce repulsion as great as exists in <num value="2">two</num> bodies charged with the same electricity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>If ever the explosion come, it will be tremendous in its results, and distant <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> must feel the shock.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> Was written on the <date value="04-05">5th of April,</date> while he was yet sojourning at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The fact that these letters may have considerable influence in giving direction to <name>British</name> sentiment, induces us to give place to the subjoined extract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It must be borne in mind that events of a stupendous nature have occurred since it was written, and for the purpose of informing himself correctly on the points at issue, <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> is now at the <rs>South</rs>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> Without the means of enforcing an authority which many of its own adherents, and most of the neutral parties, denied to it, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Administration finds itself called upon to propound a policy and to proceed to vigorous action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The demand is scarcely reasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The policy of such men suddenly lifted to the head of affairs, which they cannot attempt to guide, must be to wait and watch; and their action must be to simply tentative, as they have no power to put forth with moderate hope of success any aggressive force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Be satisfied of this,--the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> will give up no power or possession which it has at present got. By its voluntary act it will surrender nothing whatever.--No matter what reports may appear in the papers, or in letters, distrust them if they would lead you to believe that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is preparing either to abandon what he has now, or to recover that which he has not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> is in an attitude of protest; it cannot strike an offensive blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But if any attack is made upon it, the <rs>Government</rs> hopes that it will be strengthened by the indignation of the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name> to such an extent that it can not only repel the aggression, but possibly give a stimulus to a great reaction in its favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> On these principles <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName> are held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>They are claimed as Federal fortresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> still float over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Whatever may be said to the contrary, they will remain there till they are removed by the action of the <rs>Confederated States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The Commissioners of <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s Government <q>&#x0022;have reason to say that if any attempt be made to throw reinforcements into <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>, unless they receive previous notice of it as promised, it will be a breach of good faith.&#x0022;</q> From all I can learn no intention of strengthening the fort is at present entertained, but it may be doubted if the attempt would not be made should any favorable opportunity of doing so present itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>All <q> &#x0022;the movements of troops,&#x0022;</q> of which you will see accounts, are preparations against &mdash; not for &mdash; aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>At most they amount to the march of a few companies and guns to various forts, now all but undefended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/><placeName key="tgn,2047120" n="1.000 4" reg="fort washington, prince georges, maryland">Fort Washington</placeName>, of which I shall have a few words to say hereafter, was till lately held by a very inadequate force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>As a member of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> said to me, <q>&#x0022;I could have taken it last week with a little whiskey&#x0022;</q> that potent artillery being applied to the weak defences of the aged <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> artilleryman who constituted <q>&#x0022;the garrison.&#x0022;</q> The <q>&#x0022;formidable military force concentrated in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> of which you may read in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> journals, consists of about <num value="700">seven hundred</num> men of all arms, as far as I can see, and <num value="4">four</num> brass field guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>There is a good deal of drumming, filing, marching, and music going on daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>I look on and see a small band in gay uniforms, a small body of men in sombre uniforms, varying from <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> rank and file, armed, however, with excellent rifles, and a very large standard, pass by, and next day I read that such and such a company had a parade, and <q>&#x0022;attracted much admiration by their efficient and soldierly appearance, and the manner in which,&#x0022;</q> &#x0026;c.--But these military companies have no intention of righting for the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Their sympathies are quite determined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> Formidable as they would be in skirmishing in the open country, they would be of comparatively little use against regular troops at the outset of the contest, as they have never learnt to act together, and do not aspire to form even battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>But their existence indicates the strong military tendencies of the people, and the danger of doing anything that might turn them against the <rs>Government</rs>.--<persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,G.,N.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has no power to make war against the <rs>South</rs>; the <rs>Congress</rs> alone could give it to him; and that is not likely to be given, because Congress will not be assembled before the usual time, unless under the pressure of an imperious necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> Why, then, hold these forts at all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Why not give them up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Why not withdraw the garrisons, strike the flag, and cease to keep up a useless source of irritation in the midst of the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The answer to these questions is:--These forts are Federal property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The Government does not acknowledge, the existence of any right on the part of the people of the <name>States</name> to seize them as ap- <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> pertaining to the individual States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The forts are protests against the acts of violence to which the <rs>Federal</rs> authority has yielded elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>They are, moreover, the <hi rend="italics">points d'appui </hi> small as they are, on which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> can rest its resistance to the claims of the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs> to be acknowledged as an independent Republic.--If they were surrendered without attack, or without the existence of any pressure arising from the refusal of the <rs>Southern</rs> authorities to permit them to get supplies, which is an act of war, the case of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> would be, they consider, materially weakened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>If it be observed that these forts have no strategic value, it may readily be replied that their political value is very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But, serious as these considerations may be, or may be thought to be, with respect to foreign relations, there are in reference to domestic politics still more weighty inducements to hold them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The effect produced in the <name>North</name> and <name>North</name>west by an attack on the forts while the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag is floating over them would be as useful to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as the effect of abandoning the forts or tamely surrendering them would be hurtful to them in the estimation of the extreme <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>A desperate attack, a gallant defence, the shedding of the blood of gallant men, whose duty it was to defend that entrusted to their keeping, and who yielded only to numbers &mdash; the outrage on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag &mdash; would create an excitement in the <rs>Union</rs> which the <rs>South</rs> with all its determination and courage is unwilling to provoke, but which the <rs>Government</rs> would be forced to use in its own service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> Such an event must lead to war &mdash; a very terrible and merciless war; and both parties pause before they resort to that court of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Unless the <rs>Border States</rs> join in the <rs>South</rs>, <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> could scarcely hope to carry out the grand projects which are attributed to his military genius of marching northwards and dictating terms on their own soil to <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>He could scarcely venture to leave the negro population unguarded in his rear, and his flanks menaced by the seaborn Northerners on <num value="1">one</num> side, and by such operations as the water-sheds significantly indicate on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is idle to speculate on the incidents of that which may never occur, and which, occurring, may assume the insignificant aspect of border skirmishes, or the tremendous proportions of a war of races and creeds intensified by the worst elements of servile and civil conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The Government of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,G.,N.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> hope and believe that the contest may be averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The Commissioners of the <rs>South</rs> are inclined to think, also, there will be a peaceful solution &mdash; obtained, of course, by full concession and recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>But inaction cannot last on the part of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Already they have begun the system of coercion. --The supplies of the garrison at <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> will be cut off henceforth, if they are not already forbidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>They do not fear the moral effect of this act, for some of their leading men actually believe that nothing can stop the progress of a movement which will, they fondly think, absorb all the other States of the <rs>Union</rs>, and leave the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States to form an insignificant Republic of its own, with a possible larger destiny in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Their opponents in the <rs>North</rs> are fully satisfied that the direst <rs>Nemesis</rs> will fall on the <rs>Montgomery Government</rs> in the utter ruin of all their States the moment they are left to themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> The Government is elated at the success of the loan, and <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> has taken high ground in refusing offers made to him yesterday, and in resolving to issue Government securities for the balance of the amount required to complete the amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>But, though States may be sovereign, it has never been asserted that cities or portions of States are so, and in the <rs>Western</rs> and Northern portions of the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> there is a large agricultural population, which, with the aid of Government, would very speedily suppress any attempt to secede on the part of the city, if men are to be believed who say they know the circumstances of the case.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> Whatever may be the result of all these diverse actions, the <orgName n="Great Republic" type="newspaper">Great Republic</orgName> is gone!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The shape of the fragments is not yet determined any more than their late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>They may re-unite, but the cohesion can never be perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The ship of the <rs>State</rs> was built of too many <q>&#x0022;platforms; &#x0022;</q> there were too many officers on board; perhaps the principles of construction were erroneous &mdash; the rigid, cast iron old Constitution guns burst violently when tried with new projectiles &mdash; any way, those who adhere with most devotion to the vessel admit that it is parted right amidships, and that its prestige has vanished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The more desperate of these would gladly see an enemy, or go out of their way to find <num value="1">one</num>, in the hope of a common bond of union being discovered in a common animosity and danger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> The naval preparations, of which you will hear a good deal, are intended to make good existing deficiencies and to meet contingencies.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> Without stopping to inquire further into the nature of the extraordinary rumors in circulation for some time past, in reference to a threatened invasion of the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, it is at least safe to suggest as a possible truth, that it has been the persistent policy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> alarm of war, to tempt the <rs>North</rs> into an enormous scale of expenditure for military purposes, and thus to produce a more speedy exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>It would appear as though no means had been neglected &mdash; no artifice unemployed &mdash; which might tend to this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The announced intention of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to grant letters of marque, for aught that appears to the contrary, is not likely to be carried into execution; embargoes laid upon commerce at Southern ports have been raised; and Northern vessels seized have been released, in many instances, by direction of the authorities at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Nevertheless, these varied acts of hostility may have answered a purpose, by precipitating events in the <rs>North</rs>, and hastening the final issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Meanwhile, the <rs>Southern States</rs> seem to be husbanding their resources in every possible way. Individuals serve in the ranks as common soldiers, gratuitously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Not unfrequently, as the newspapers state, whole companies are put on a war footing, with no other expense to the <rs>General Government</rs> than the providing of muskets; and railways do the necessary transportation without indemnity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> Reviewing the events of the last few weeks, it may well be doubted whether there has ever been any settled purpose to invade the <rs>National Capital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>But even if we accept this as a solution of certain rumors and proceedings otherwise difficult of explanation, it cannot be said that the extensive preparations for the defence of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> are ill-advised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Without them, the political attitude of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the <rs>Border States</rs> might have given much more reason for concern; and besides, the concentration of a large force at some convenient point is absolutely necessary. </p> </div3>

In what may be called the <num value="2">two</num> chief cities of the rival Federations, the belief that war was at hand prevailed equally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>In New York there was as we have said, a panic on the <rs>Stock Exchange</rs>, while from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> the telegraph announced that the dreaded moment had arrived, and a rupture would at once take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> Such is the momentous intelligence which we publish to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>We may here, however, repeat the hope so often expressed on this side of the ocean, that if the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the late Union be destined to separation, the change may be accomplished without the spilling of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>It may, perhaps, be too late to indulge in such wishes, yet we will not give up all hope that even at the last hour moderate counsels may have prevailed, and that this fratricidal war has been checked in the outset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>There is obviously no reason for a contest now, which did not exist with at least equal force during the whole of last month &mdash; nay, the enterprise of attempting to force the seceding States to return to their allegiance is far less justifiable now than it would have been at the beginning of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,G.,N.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s administration, because it has become by the lapse of time infinitely more difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>I will, however, give you a few items which may perhaps be agreeable to your numerous readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>We have not as yet been attacked, or had occasion to measure arms or exchange shots with our enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/> Our market is bountifully supplied with green peas, strawberries, soft crabs, and other luxuries of the season, and all selling at moderate prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>They will now perceive, particularly those fond of good living, what the rash and precipitous acts of themselves have brought them to. Here we have everything that an epicure even might desire, and that at the lowest prices, because, in consequence of the blockade, our truckers are debarred the privilege of sending their produce to a Northern market.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/> In these times of war, every man is expected to show his patriotism in every way not positively injurious to his well being and that of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>We have in this city set very good examples to the world of disinterested patriotism, but I begin to hear occasionally that same <q> &#x0022;hoarse voice&#x0022;</q> that was heard in revolutionary times in <placeName reg="Hanover county, Virginia" key="tgn,1002451">Hanover county</placeName>, as described by <persName n="Wirt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Wirt,nomatch:0"><surname>Wirt</surname></persName> in <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>'s speeches against an unprincipled speculator-- <q>&#x0022;Beef, beef, beef.&#x0022;</q> Provisions in our city all at once popped up <num value="0.5">50 per cent.</num> Hams now sell at <measure n="20cents" type="currency">20 cents</measure>, sides <measure n="17cents" type="currency">17 cents</measure>, coffee <num value="18.5">18&#x00BD;</num> to <measure n="20cents" type="currency">20 cents</measure>, flour <measure n="10.50dollars" type="currency">$10.50</measure> to <measure n="12.50dollars" type="currency">$12.50</measure>, and butter <measure n="60cents" type="currency">60 cents</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/> In times like these, no man with a soul will speculate upon his neighbor and his people, and he who does it ought to be made to feel the weight of public odium and disapproval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Moreover, all corporations should at least show once in a century that they have a spark of the noble, a glimmering flicker at least of the generous feeling of humanity in their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Railroad companies can do much to relieve the families of those who have gone to fight the battles of these railroad gentlemen, and the speculators, too; and they certainly ought to do all in their power to keep the necessaries of life as low as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>I then suggest, inasmuch as you are blockaded, that all the railroads in this Southern country put down their freights to as low a rate as possible, and make through rates from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to this city.

<p>
