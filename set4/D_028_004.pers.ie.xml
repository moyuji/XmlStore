<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> We know not whether we are justified in giving credit to the intelligence published by us yesterday, and derived from a neighboring journal, to the effect that <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> had been attacked when in the act of raising the siege of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and that, on the <date value="12-20">20th of December,</date> he had made up for his ill-fortune by defeating the enemy severely at <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We say we know not whether this report is entitled to entire credit; but the substance of it corresponds so well with what we had previously conceived to be the true state of the case that we cannot avoid attributing to it a certain degree of probability at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Had <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> been so badly beaten on the <date value="12-15">15th of December</date> as to compel a retreat so rapid and disorderly that it entailed a loss of <measure n="10000" type="prisoners">ten thousand prisoners</measure>, in addition to the killed and wounded, it is impossible that he should have been, on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="2">19th</day></dateStruct>, only <measure n="22miles" type="distance">twenty-two miles</measure> from the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>His army would, by that time, either have been many miles farther off or it would have been entirely dispersed, especially when we take into consideration the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> statement that <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> lost only <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men in the battle itself, and that <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> lost double that number, besides <measure n="800" type="prisoners">eight hundred prisoners</measure>; that the immense subsequent captures were a consequence of the total rout sustained by <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, and that his white force previously to the action was but <num value="35000">thirty-five thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Still farther <unclear></unclear> it impossible that an army thus badly ruled, and losing thus enormously, should have been able to hold together <unclear></unclear> tenaciously as to be found, at the end of <num value="1">one</num> week from the destructive battle, only <measure n="41miles" type="distance">forty-one miles</measure> from the field, while the army was not nearer than <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>From the same <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers we are hearing every day of preparations made to prevent this routed and disorganized army from crossing the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, thereby assigning to it a <unclear></unclear> which most assuredly it would not possess had it ever suffered as severely as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> pretend it has.--The annihilation of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, indeed, seems to resemble that of <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName> last fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is quite consistent with his still continuing to hold his ground and to present <unclear></unclear> and defiant an attitude as ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> These facts we noticed some days ago, and we ventured to suggest at the time that when the truth came to be known, brought the report of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> himself, or from other trustworthy sources, <unclear></unclear> would be found that the panic into which our people had been thrown by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> reports was greatly disproportion to the actual facts of the case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Corresponding so well as the intelligence in question does with our own preconceived views of the matter, we cannot but place a certain degree of reliance upon it. If, on the <date value="12-20">20th of December,</date> there was another battle, in which <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> obtained a signal victory and <measure n="1" type="captured">captured one</measure> whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> brigade; and if, about the same time, <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName> captured another entire brigade, with a train of <num value="600">six hundred</num> wagons, we can easily account for what would be altogether unaccountable upon the supposition that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> told the truth &mdash; namely: the tardiness of their pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is absolutely impossible that an army which had routed another army, taken from it <measure n="800" type="prisoners">eight hundred prisoners</measure> on the field of battle and <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> more in the pursuit, should, at the end of <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, find itself still <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> from that routed and disorganized army, having pursued at the rate of <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> a day. But if, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> in the interval, the pursuing army had itself met with a severe reverse, the whole thing is intelligible enough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> We think it plain enough that our people had allowed themselves to give way to a panic much too easily &mdash; that there is no real cause for alarm with regard to the safety of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and that there is far less for the despondency, approaching despair, which has come over the minds of many who are not wont to be either despondent or desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our people must come out of this cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They must, as before, bend up all their energies to encounter the trials yet before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They should recollect that they have already encountered a force such as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will never be able to bring again into the field, and that they have encountered it successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If they would resolve to receive, hereafter, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> statements &mdash; gotten up always for effect &mdash; with more grains of allowance than heretofore, it would be quite as well for their own peace of mind, and infinitely better for the public cause. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> of yesterday makes certain suggestions with regard to the railroads south of us, to which we invite the earnest attention of the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It proposes to put in the link between <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, which is only <measure n="75miles" type="distance">seventy-five miles</measure>. The railroad now runs from <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> to <placeName reg="Aiken, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095227">Aiken</placeName>'s, almost in a direct line to <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Taking <placeName reg="Aiken, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095227">Aiken</placeName>'s as a point of departure, <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> might be joined by a railroad <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>At <placeName reg="Branchville, Orangeburg, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095395">Branchville</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> line, the road deflects to the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A line from <placeName reg="Kingville, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096087">Kingsville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> would be much safer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>These roads completed, from <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> there would be a choice of roads, either by <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> or by <placeName reg="Charlotte, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013584">Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>, on the upper route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Higher up, <placeName reg="Abbeville, Abbeville, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095219">Abbeville</placeName> is in railroad connection with <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Athens, Clarke, Georgia" key="tgn,7013329">Athens</placeName> (which is opposite to it, in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>,) is in connection with the <orgName n="Augusta and Atlanta Railroad" type="railroad">Augusta and Atlanta railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> says these points are not more than <measure n="65miles" type="distance">sixty-five miles</measure> apart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> There is no possibility of exaggerating the importance of these connections.--The only question is with regard to the possibility of obtaining the material for the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> gets over this difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Large portions of the railroads leading to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> are now useless to us. If left as they are, they will become useful to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is surely good policy to dismantle them at once, and make use of them in constructing roads for our own purposes.--We hope the attention of the authorities will be turned to this subject. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> As an illustration of how some of them disappear, here is the record of <num value="1">one</num> single regiment among those that have come to my notice: Of <num value="3">three</num> detachments of substitutes sent from <placeName reg="Concord, Merrimack, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013647">Concord, New Hampshire</placeName>, to join the <orgName type="regiment" key="5NHVolunteer">Fifth New Hampshire volunteers</orgName>, amounting to <num value="625">six hundred and twenty-five</num> men, <num value="137">one hundred and thirty-seven</num> <hi rend="italics">deserted on the passage, </hi> leaving only <num value="488">four hundred and eighty-eight</num> to arrive at the regiment.--Of the <num value="488">four hundred and eighty eight</num> who got to the regiment and were assigned to companies, <num value="82">eighty-two</num> deserted to the enemy from picket line; <num value="36">thirty-six</num> deserted to the rear; <num value="4">four</num> have been discharged as utterly worthless, their physical incapacity being so glaring, and of such long standing, that it must have been known at the time of enlistment; <num value="5">five</num> have been sent back to <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord</placeName>, to have their cases of enlistment investigated, by order of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>; and <num value="2">two</num> have been discharged by order of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Thus, out of <num value="625">six hundred and twenty-five</num> of these bounty tempted warriors sent to <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> regiment only since <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> last, there are only <num value="359">three hundred and fifty-nine</num> left; and, as these have come to the army through the same venal influences, and probably gone through the same loose or fraudulent examination, it is impossible to tell how many more may follow suit, in spite of the death penalty before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>I use the term <hi rend="italics">fraudulent</hi> advisedly; for, out of the <num value="4">four</num> discharged as utterly worthless, <num value="1">one</num> man had <num value="1">one</num> leg several inches shorter than the other; <num value="1">one</num> had hernia, that had made him a cripple for many years past; and the <num value="2">two</num> others were such impracticable imbeciles that any imbecile, without <num value="1">one</num> particle of medical knowledge, must have seen at a glance that they were utterly incapable of any duty whatever, mental or physical.--These are shameful revelations, but the sooner the public are made acquainted with the existence of such monstrous abuses, the sooner do we stand a chance of seeing them rectified. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>We see no reason to doubt that the negroes will fight for their masters as willingly as they work for them, and we imagine a Southern negro is quite as capable of fighting as his Northern brother.
