<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Our reports from the scene of operations yesterday were exceedingly meagre, and to obtain really reliable information was decidedly difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Of rumors there was no scarcity, from early in the morning until late in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In the forenoon the following dispatch was received at this office and posted upon the bulletin: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops have all passed down the same direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They left a great many wounded and sick at <placeName reg="Shirley, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2660001">Shirley</placeName>, besides a large lot of stores, &#x0026;c. A great many of the <rs>Federals</rs> were driven from <placeName reg="Shirley, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2660001">Shirley</placeName> by the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops, and escaped over into <placeName reg="Eppes's Island">Eppes's Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Heavy firing was heard down the river this morning.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <placeName reg="Eppes's Island">Eppes's Island</placeName> is opposite <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, and separated from the main land (<persName n="Shirley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Shirley,nomatch:0"><surname>Shirley</surname></persName>) by a marsh, which is overflowed at high tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It must have been a difficult task for the retreating <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to reach the <rs type="place">Island</rs> under the circumstances, and we shall not be surprised to hear that many of them published in the attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Among the prevalent rumors yesterday evening was <num value="1">one</num> that <num value="7000">7,000</num> of the enemy had been captured below <persName n="Curl,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Curl,nomatch:0"><surname>Curl</surname></persName>'s Neck, but we were unable to trace it to any authentic source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Persons coming from the last battle field were utterly unable to give any definite account of the situation of affairs, though many were quite confident that the bulk of the <rs>Federal</rs> army had either escaped by the river, or got under cover of their gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><num value="1">One</num> gentleman who left the scene of the recent struggle about midday informed us that he heard cannot aiding apparently a few miles below, but that it was not of long duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A considerable number of prisoners were brought in yesterday. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> It appears from all accounts that <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, after the battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, continued to make a rapid retreat, but with what success remains yet to be developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A report came from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> last evening that the <rs>Federals</rs> were landing on the <rs>South</rs> side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, below <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, with the supposed intention of making a diversion in the direction of <placeName reg="Prince Georges county, Maryland" key="tgn,7016105">Prince George county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Whether this report be authentic or otherwise, the enemy will make no movement that is not closely watched by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and should he attempt to retrieve his heavy disasters of the past week, a bold and gallant army will be ready to confront him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> A large number of wagons, abandoned by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on their retreat from the line of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, will be speedily transferred to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, filled with commissary and other stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> About <num value="50">fifty</num> pieces of <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> abandoned by the enemy, were taken by our troops yesterday &mdash; All were spiked. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The <orgName n="Petersburg Express" type="newspaper">Petersburg <hi rend="italics">Express</hi></orgName> of yesterday has the following information: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Parties who came over yesterday afternoon, give it as their opinion that the enemy have been surrounded, or nearly so, and that but few comparatively will be enabled to escape by means of their gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On the other hand <unclear>videt</unclear> from Bermuds Hundreds, and parties from <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>, who reached <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday afternoon, report that the enemy's transports were passing up and down <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> all day yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We hear, too, that these boats invariably display the yellows flag, thereby indicating a vast number of wounded, or else resorting to a bit of deception eminently characteristic of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They have on repeated occasions refused to respect the yellow flag which has been holded upon our hospitals, and have actually tired upon it. This was done at <placeName reg="Ball Run, Lancaster, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2146064">Ball Run</placeName>, on the <date value="07-18">18th of July,</date> again at <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, and also at other places which we cannot now recall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> We hear that the <measure n="4" type="prisoners">four prisoners</measure> who were taken or the <rs>Chesterfield</rs> shore <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> they having been drilled over by the current, state that the amount of dissatisfaction prevailing in <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was vast, but that when cornered and under the eye of their officers, they would fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>These men did not hesitate to state it as their opinion, that there were <num value="1000">thousands</num> who would willingly leave, if it were in their power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Late on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, our pickets in <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName> overhauled a fugitive from <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, who had swam the river, and sought safety in the house of a free negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The poor creature was <unclear>famished,</unclear> had on nothing in the shape of <rs n="wearing apparel" type="product">wearing apparel</rs> save a shirt, and declared his utter aversion to ever again taking up arms against the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This fugitive stated that <num value="1000">thousands</num> would have cheerfully joined him in his voyage, but for the fear of meeting a watery grave, and we do not doubt that he spoke the truth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> We learn from a gentleman who resides in <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>, that the wagon train to which we referred yesterday as being at <placeName reg="Berkeley, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2164026">Berkeley, in Charles City county</placeName>, on the bank of the river, was greatly augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> and yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>These wagons now line the banks of the river for miles and number several <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is supposed that they have been driven there to secure them from capture, but we are of the opinion that a body of <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> could dash down and secure the horses, if not the wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There are no gunboats lying near; or there were none yesterday, all being occupied higher up the river, in the more immediate vicinity of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s forces. </p> </q><bibl n=""></bibl></cit> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> During the exciting scenes of the past week, the famous body of cavalry under command of <persName n="Stuart,General,J.,F.,B.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Stuart,J.,F.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> have by no means been idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They left <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num>, and were near <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s army at the time of proceeding across from <placeName reg="Hanover county, Virginia" key="tgn,1002451">Hanover county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Subsequently they visited the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, where they found no enemy, but abundant evidences of his attempt at wholesale destruction before leaving the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><placeName><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s house</placeName> was burnt, with other buildings, and an immense quantity of grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had deposited here a very large amount of commissary stores, including everything necessary for supplying their army; and although their purpose was to destroy the whole, much was left uninjured, and arrangements have been made to remove it to a place where it can be made available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Our cavalry, who had ridden a long distance without food, found here enough to satisfy all their immediate wants, and men and horses were properly refreshed from the stores left behind by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Measures were taken to prevent a speedy use of the railroad, by the enemy, in the possible event of his return, and after scouring the country in the neighborhood, the cavalry left the <rs>While House</rs> taking the route towards <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>They had <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> skirmishes with the enemy, and secured a number of prisoners, losing none themselves, and having no more than <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure> during their entire progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Many of our citizens have been indefatigable in their attentions to the wounded, working incessantly both day and night to have them conveyed to the various hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>That there has been some delay and some suffering in consequence, is quite true, but, under the circumstances, this was unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>A large number of convalescents were sent into the interior by trains yesterday afternoon, and this practice will doubtless be continued so long as it may be necessary, to give ample room in the hospitals for those wounded in the recent engagements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Some additional buildings were fitted no yesterday for their accommodation, and it will take but a short time to get everything in complete order, and ensure good nursing to every <num value="1">one</num> who has been or may be brought is Meanwhile, it is the duty of every citizen to bestow upon them such care and attention as may be in his power, and to take as many into their private residences as their circumstances will allow. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The period of delay is drawing to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The volcanic state of things along the whole line denotes that the eruption is near at band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The present danger, or probability, is that a general engagement will be brought on, not by a direct attack, or any movement having that for its sole purpose, but by a preliminary step, the seizing of a position &mdash; the shifting and setting of the scenes, the immediate prelude to raising the curtain on the last act of the drama.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>I have no direct authority for saying that the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> will soon cease to be the point of the particular interest which it at present has, as the base of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, yet I am left to infer as much from a variety of reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The breaking up of the hospitals there, by sending away the large number of patients in the <unclear>vicinity,</unclear> may not be proof in itself of <unclear>su </unclear> intention, though such fact, taken in connection with others, might go to strengthen such a supposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Whether there is any real ground for the alleged apprehension concerning the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, as the base, we may well suppose that, as <num value="1">one</num> of the moves on the board, and among the last moves in the great game now drawing to a close, the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders may conclude that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> can employ his forces in no way so well as to abandon the campaign in the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>, and make a rapid descent toward the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> on <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The prize which the immense stores there offer would not be the only motive, for the movement would be the favorable <num value="1">one</num> for the <rs>Confederates</rs> to attack our entire line, weakened, as they might reasonably suppose it would be, by the diversions which the sudden appearance of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, or some <num value="1">one</num> else, in our rear would tend to produce. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Without undertaking to say that precisely this is being done, I will say the country may rest assured that in case <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> has made his appearance in the quarter alleged, he will find troops to oppose him; and their embarkation on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> or the <rs>Potomac</rs>, or both, would only prove the vigilance and resources of the <rs>Government</rs> in checkmating the wily enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> This decision of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> will profoundly incense an anxious public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>There may be some good and sufficient reason for keeping back the news; and it is well, perhaps, not to be too hasty in condemning <persName n="Stanton,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>; but enough is known to excite the keenest anxiety until the particulars are published and the result understood. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>There are several obvious theories to account for this suppression of the news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most probable is that the final result was not officially known, and that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, if he was following up the enemy to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, had not time to compose official dispatches to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, Until he was heard from it may have been deemed inexpedient to make any publication of the disjointed facts in possession of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> Another and not so hopeful view of the case may be that after the telegraph agent left the ground to take his special message to <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> another battle may have taken place not so favorable to our arms, or which had not been concluded up to last evening.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> We incline to the belief that a victory has been won, and that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is now in or near <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.
