<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Such a revolution in public sentiment as has occurred in the last <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, in this State, is without precedent in the history of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The fact, that country after country has spoken in primary assemblage upon such a momentous question as that which agitates the country, we may say, unanimously on <num value="1">one</num> side of that question, is without parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/> Whether the policy of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Government shall inaugurate the catastrophe of war, or perpetuate the blessings of peace, it is known here that a reconstruction, or reorganization of the <rs>Union</rs>, except by the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, is as hopeless as the flames that burn to light the dead.
