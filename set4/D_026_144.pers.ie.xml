<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> At an early hour yesterday morning the various rumors from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> began to assume shape and form, and as the day advanced reliable accounts of the situation of affairs were received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It appears that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, soon after dawn, the enemy advanced with <num value="7">seven</num> regiments of infantry and <num value="1">one</num> of cavalry, by the <rs type="place">City Point</rs> read, upon some breast works hastily thrown up during the preceding night, at <placeName><persName n="Taylor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,nomatch:0"><surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, <num value="6">six</num> or <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Here they were met by <orgName type="regiment" key="4NCCav"><persName n="Ferrebee,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Ferrebee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ferrebee</surname></persName>'s 4th North Carolina cavalry</orgName> and <persName n="Graham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Graham,nomatch:0"><surname>Graham</surname></persName>'s (<placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>) battery, who fought bravely and held them in check for <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, but were finally compelled to fall back before overwhelming numbers, which, was done in good order and with but few casualties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The loss inflicted upon the enemy was serious, the balls and shells telling upon them with admirable effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>A report that <persName n="Graham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Graham,nomatch:0"><surname>Graham</surname></persName> lost <num value="1">one</num> gun, in consequence of the horses being disabled, is not confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>At other points along our lines the attacks of the enemy were feeble, and easily repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Good execution was done during the morning by our sharpshooters, who picked off the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> whenever they showed themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>A few prisoners were taken, who represented that they belonged to <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, and said that his entire command was at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> fellow, mounted on a blooded horse, rode into our lines at full speed, without his cap. The animal was probably stolen from some <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> gentleman, and being anxious to get back to his former owner, ran away with his rider, and delivered him up to the <rs>Confederates</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> At <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the afternoon, when comparative quiet had prevailed along the lines for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> or more, the general impression was that the fighting had ceased for the day. This, however, proved to be a mistake; for it was ascertained before dark that the enemy had massed a very heavy force on our left &mdash; especially on the <rs type="place">City Point</rs> and <placeName reg="Prince George Court-House">Prince George Court-House</placeName> roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>At sunset they charged our batteries commanding these roads, advancing in line of battle <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> columns deep.
