<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It was, indeed, a very severe and hotly-contested fight, in which we lost a large number of men; but the losses of the enemy were far greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The battle occurred on the <placeName reg="Berryville, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2110642">Berryville</placeName> road, about <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName></placeName>, and so far from having been a &#x0022;surprise&#x0022; to our troops, the earlier part of the engagement was decidedly in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><placeName reg="Fishers Hill, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2328677">Fisher's Hill</placeName>, the position to which our troops fell back, is represented to be a very strong <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>With the exception of the loss of ground, all the advantage of the battle remained on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We are still of opinion, however, that it occurred on the <placeName reg="Berryville, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2110642">Berryville</placeName> road, below <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The enemy, it is stated, massed a large body of cavalry on our right, and compelled our troops to fall back, which they did fighting every foot of the way. We learn that our loss in killed, wounded and prisoners bears no comparison to that of the enemy, which was enormous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We made <placeName reg="Sambro Head">Sambro Head</placeName> at an early hour, and then ran along the rocky coast towards the mouth of the harbor.--Presently we saw a small boat coming through the mist, and a cheery <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> voice asked if we wanted a pilot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>To be sure we did &mdash; and a red-faced weather-beaten young fisherman clambered over the side.--At the entrance to the harbor, or rather <placeName reg="Chebucto bay">Chebucto bay</placeName>, we stopped to fire the guns, the law prohibiting, or, at least, courtesy forbidding, us going into a neutral port with shotted guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>A regular branch pilot now came off to us and took the ship from the fisherman, who was only permitted to take in vessels when no pilot was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Being wet and disagreeable on deck, we saw but little of the scenery in going up the bay. Getting short glimpses through the open ports, we saw the shore was well cultivated and dotted here and there with little white villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>There are also some fine farms that stretch back from the water &mdash; the green pasture lands covered with sheep and cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> only to the city, and in less than an hour we were anchored off the town. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The houses are built principally of wood, and have an air of age, although the main portion of the town is comparatively new. Along the bay is the business portion, and back upon the hill the residences of the merchants and the military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The land upon which the city is built rises rapidly from the water into a hill, crowning which is the citadel, a strong and heavily-armed fortress, protecting the town and commanding the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> We did not think proper yesterday morning to make any remarks, except in the news columns of this paper, upon the reverse experienced last Monday by the army under <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We preferred to wait until we could gather more facts and form a more decided opinion from the concordance or discrepancy of such portions of the testimony as were presented to our observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Even now, after the lapse of several days since the action, the materials for a correct judgment are very scanty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>These facts, however, seem sufficiently clear: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> The army under <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> has, of late, been powerfully reenforced by fresh troops &mdash; believed to be from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The unfortunate truce, into which <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> seems to have been seduced by a mistaken humanity, afforded an opportunity for this operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has fortified himself at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, as it was foreseen that he would, and has worked upon the fortifications until he has made them nearly impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He trusts their defence to a comparatively small body of men, and he sends off the remainder to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, who uses them at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, or in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, as the occasion may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, they have enabled <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> to strike this blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>At <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>; nothing has yet been attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>But there can be no doubt that many of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s troops have already arrived in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s camp, and many more are on their way.--The same plan which failed so signally last summer is to be tried again this fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>A heavy force is to be poured into the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> to capture <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, the <orgName n="Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Tennessee railroad</orgName>, and the <rs type="place">James River canal</rs>, and to obtain permanent possession of the <orgName n="Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Danville railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central railroad</orgName> is to be taken and held by a column pushed on from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Junction</rs>, which will give the command of both roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They are to lend the hand to another column to be landed at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is thus to be cut off from all communication, and finally invested by a powerful army of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>; and not withstanding their repeated failures, they believe that they will capture it this time, with, probably, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>They do not regard blood or expense, provided they succeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> There is <num value="1">one</num> objection to this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It is the anaconda, (on a contracted field,) within whose folds <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> proposed to stifle the liberties of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>It places the troops of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in a central position, and enables them to strike right and left at their enemies, always taking them in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>That it will succeed if put into execution against such troops as ours, commanded by such a General as <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, we do not believe for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Yet, that it is the plan which is to be tried, seems plain to us, if for no other reason than that it was the plan of last summer, which failed so egregiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>These combined operations rarely ever succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>They resemble a complicated piece of machinery, which is rendered entirely useless by the loss of a single screw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>They are liable to a <num value="1000">thousand</num> accidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>A general may oversleep himself, or a column may take the wrong direction, or a battalion may arrive too late at the rendezvous, or some general may misunderstand orders, or some <num value="1">one</num> of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> casualties, each of itself sufficient to upset the whole scheme of the campaign may occur to mar the plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Nevertheless, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have made a good beginning, provided they can only keep it up. To seize <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> is certainly their object just now. Can they do it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> We are confident that they cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/><persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> was defeated, certainly, and compelled to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>But it is obvious that, though his loss was severe, (according to his own statement,) his troops were neither discouraged nor demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>He appears to have brought off his whole train of wagons and munitions with very trilling loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>He fought all day and he lost but <num value="3">three</num> pieces of cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>He seems to have drawn off his forces in a leisurely and orderly manner; and he occupied, at last accounts, a strong position, which can be attacked only in front, unless the enemy make a very long <hi rend="italics">detour</hi> in order to turn his flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>That he inflicted a great loss upon the enemy is evident from their having neglected to pursue him. He is in a country where strong positions, in which a small army can set a large <num value="1">one</num> at defiance, are to be found in abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>There are many admirable spots for battle-fields between him and <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, and many more between <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> and <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>He is now in a country which <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00123" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Celia,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> rendered immortal by the skill, rapidity and success of his movements; and he is not in a position so perilous as <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Celia,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was after the <rs n="Battle of Kernstown" type="battle">battle of Kernstown</rs>, and before the brilliant exploits which set him free from the enemies that surrounded him, and enabled him to throw his whole force upon the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>He seems to have fought a battle as obstinate as that which <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Celia,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> fought at <placeName key="tgn,7017708" n="1.000 36" reg="winchester, winchester, virginia">Kernstown</placeName>, and to have stunned his enemy quite as much as <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Celia,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> did on that occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Should he even not be reinforced, as he will be no doubt, he yet has it in his power to prevent the enemy from perfecting his plan of seizing <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> preparatory to isolating <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and he will exert his utmost to do it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> The enemy will raise a great cry of triumph over this victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>We should not be surprise <unclear></unclear> hear that another day of thanksgiving had been ordered by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who is always thankful for the smallest favors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press will not he more than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>That it could hardly do. But it will lie to the full extent of its very extraordinary capacity for exaggerating truth and suggesting falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>This battle will secure the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, of which, indeed, there was no doubt before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It will set a few croakers to work in our midst; that is easily done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>But it will have no effect whatever upon the issue of the war. In the meantime, we are happy to perceive that it has not materially affected the spirits of our people generally, who have become accustomed to the casualties of war, and know that unvarying success cannot be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>No disaster can be fatal, indeed, as long as the people continue true to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The great poet says of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>: </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> The people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, or, at least, the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, are fully sensible of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>No calamity has occurred during the war which has made a lasting impression upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Stunned for a moment, they soon recover and proceed at once to do all in their power to repair the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It will be so now it has been so in cases much more serious than the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> are aware that they are on the eve of a tremendous struggle for the retention of their capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>They are prepared for it, and will put forth their strength to the utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Should they even be overwhelmed, and lose the capital for which they are contending, they will not be discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>They know full well that there never was a struggle for liberty yet in which brute force was not on the side of the oppressor; that, in particular, this war would never have occurred had the forces of the parties been anything like equal; that in a struggle thus unequal, disasters must inevitably come, and days of gloom and uncertainty be consequent thereupon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But they know likewise, that by holding out to the end they will assuredly triumph, and this they will do in spite of all that fortune and superior force can do against them.--<placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is as determined this day to persevere until her independence and that of her sister States be secured, as she was on the day that she seceded from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Reverses in the field, the slaughter of her young men, the affliction carried home to nearly every family within her boundaries, the loss of property, the desolation of whole districts, the fury of a war unparalleled in dimensions and ferocity, have produced in her no change or shadow of turning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>She thinks no more of giving up the day after a defeat than she does the day after a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Other States no doubt, entertain the same sentiments and resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We speak only for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
