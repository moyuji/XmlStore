<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But <num value="1">one</num> of the most uncalled for acts was the closing of the <rs type="place">Episcopal Churches</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Of course, such a proceeding startled the hearers, who, being mostly composed of ladies, gave slight expression to their feelings; <persName n="Goodrich,Reverend,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Goodrich,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Strong unhesitatingly refused, and ordered the assembly to disperse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was a very affecting sight; few eyes were dry, and even Strong seemed for a moment to be conscious of the criminality of his actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Immediately after the benediction every <num value="1">one</num> of the congregation approached <persName n="Goodrich,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Goodrich,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goodrich</surname></persName>, some crying and others shaking hands with him, while Strong was assailed with unrestrained invectives, and he then had the audacity to state that it was a very painful mission he was performing; that he felt as much hurt as the ladies did, &#x0026;c. Slowly the congregation moved, which, exasperating Strong, he called for the sexton, and ordered the doors to be immediately closed; but, with the door-way crowded, the poor sexton was obliged to wait until the people retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Here an English gentleman spokes his mind very freely to Strong, who threatened to arrest him; but, finding the gentleman was a British subject, he desisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Strong also threatened to have a cannon brought up, to which a lady suggested that he had <q>&#x0022;better bring a gunboat,&#x0022;</q>as it was in them that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> generally sought refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Any how, a company of soldiers, with fixed bayonets were drawn up before the church and dispersed the ladies from off the sidewalk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>You and your friends are beginning to see in what an awkward dilemma you have placed <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>You made the war for the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>You were willing to let the <rs>Union</rs> slide,&#x0022; in order to free the slaves of the <rs>South</rs>, under the cover of &#x0022;military necessity.&#x0022; You could not produce that &#x0022;necessity&#x0022; without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> getting up a civil war, and you got up that war so ingeniously as to make it seem not your act, but the act of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Now you discover that the work of &#x0022;wiping out&#x0022; the <rs>South</rs> is not so easy a job as you supposed it would be. Your only remaining hope is in inciting the slaves to revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Your panacea for all the terrible evils of this so called rebellion, is a <hi rend="italics">servile insurrection.</hi> And you tell <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, poor old man, that if he does not help you to set the negroes of the <rs>South</rs> to cutting the throats of the women and children in that section, you will not only fail in your emancipation scheme, but that the war will end by a separation of the <rs>Union</rs> which will leave all Yankeedoodledom &#x0022;out in the cold!&#x0022; That is just what we have expected from the beginning, and that is just what will certainly occur, if the <name>States</name> which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fanaticism and injustice have driven into secession cannot be forced back again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>That they can or will be is hardly probable, if we may judge from the small progress that has yet been made in the enterprise, after nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of prodigious effort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> We believe that the <rs>North</rs> has already put forth the greatest strength she will ever exert in this struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>She is capable of more; but <hi rend="italics">she has lost heart in the cause, </hi> and she has lost it only because of the gross manner in which the radical Abolition partisans of the <name>Administration</name> have misused both the armies and the treasures of a loyal, but conservative people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/><hi rend="italics">We believe that the last army that the <rs>North</rs> will ever raise and put in the field in this war, is now in the field, and that it must conquer the rebellion or fail.</hi> If it <unclear>fails,</unclear> then the dissolution of the old Union will be <hi rend="italics">un fail accompli,</hi> and in that event the <num value="6">six</num> States of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, which together are not much, if any, bigger than <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, will find themselves &#x0022;left alone in their glory.&#x0022;--And they will have no right to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>They will really have earned that guerdon of isolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Like arrogant partners, representing a very small proportion of joint capital, they have striven to bend the views, wishes, and interests of the firm to their special benefit, and are likely, in the end, to be kicked out of a concern in which they have sought to enjoy a disproportionate control and advantage against all the plain stipulations and equities of the original contract. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> If. our opinion, events show that the great mistake made in forming the <rs>Union</rs>, in the outset, was in taking <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> into the partnership on any terms whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>And we are quite as sure that <hi rend="italics">no confederation of States of which she is a part can ever exist in peace, harmony, and property on this Continent.</hi> She is too selfish for any association founded in mutual compromise of opposed interests; too intellectually conceited to subordinate her insane ideas of &#x0022;higher law&#x0022; to the collected wisdom of a great commonwealth, and too meddling in other people's business for a political system which allows no <num value="1">one</num> State in the <rs>Union</rs> to entrench on the reserved rights of any other.

His head is slightly sprinkled with grey, and his whiskers are grey, yet he is a younger man in appearance and in feelings than we had conceived him to be; his voice soft and persuasive, yet distinct and full-toned, and he is in the habit of speaking occasionally an exceeding good thing in a most quiet, accidental sort of way. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> His dress was plain and unassuming, and his baggage limited to a single leather valise, with the initials <q>&#x0022;J. D.&#x0022;</q> marked upon the side.
