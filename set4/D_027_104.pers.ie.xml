<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>To attain this invaluable end, the people must be fed and clothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Believing that our cause appeals to all parties and interest alike, we trust the people will unite and act in concert in achieving our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What we <hi rend="italics">will</hi> to do, we can accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> in assessing the value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>, we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In other words, that they should be selected and then impressed accordingly as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> when they assessed the average value of such horses as the <rs>Government</rs> needed at <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>. But cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed. --yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value,</hi> are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> the term average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We supposed that, in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, some might be estimated at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or price for a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of good, sound and efficient horses or mules, <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> in illustration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient and able to render good service for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>- class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few, comparatively, come up to the standard, and are therefore entitled to the maximum price, so, of course, in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class, &#x0026;c. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quality of Sorghum Molasses is the consistency of honey and free from all acidity to the taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and inferior qualities of Molasses should be <hi rend="italics">reduced </hi> in price from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="0.2">twenty per cent.</num>, accordingly as they fall <hi rend="italics">below </hi> the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quality. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>At this juncture, large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was, in a few days thereafter, to be taxed <num value="33">thirty- three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members losing out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedule of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing, in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Therefore we asses the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules impressed since the passage of the currency bill, of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure>.--This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing officers and agents should forthwith </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> call on all those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a accruement upon the foregoing basis; but allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>- class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our <hi rend="italics">average</hi> appraisement of <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>, and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules and proportionately less for the inferior as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The county appraisement will be the guide in making these settlements, but within the limits of our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure> and our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>. This plan would perhaps be most satisfactory to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>For whatever price the county appraisers agreed upon should be deemed fair within the range of our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure> and our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>; payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issue of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should, in all such cases, themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But if, after this revaluation and settlement, any person should not be satisfied, the party could then appeal to our Board and have the case reconsidered. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>A visit to the front yesterday has put us in possession of some additional particulars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> During <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the enemy massed on our left, on the <rs type="place">Darbytown</rs> and <address><street n="Charles City road">Charles City roads</street></address>; and the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 18">Eighteenth corps</orgName>, which, up to that time, had held the line at, and in the vicinity of, <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, was withdrawn and marched across the <rs type="place">Darby</rs> and <address><street n="Charles City road">Charles City roads</street></address> and in the direction of the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road, the object being, by overlapping our left, to get possession of our works on the latter road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> and the position vacated by the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 18">Eighteenth corps</orgName> were entrusted to a small force of newly-arrived troops, mostly artillerists, who, to judge by their general appearance, their new knapsacks, &#x0026;c., are recent conscripts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> About <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the enemy made a heavy attack upon our lines on the <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Darby</placeName> road, and, being repulsed, renewed the assault repeatedly, but each time with the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The fight here was kept up for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> or more, and the enemy's loss in killed and wounded was very severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Our losses, we have before stated, amounted to almost nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We had a few men wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Though this attack was well sustained and determined; and though, doubtless, the enemy would have liked to have broken our lines there, yet we think it was but a demonstration to cover a much more important movement, and <num value="1">one</num> upon which, no doubt, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> counted largely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It was designed to engage our attention while the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 18">Eighteenth corps</orgName> passed to the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road and seized our works there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But again <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was thwarted by the skill of our generals and the valor of our troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> Owing to the small quantity of rain that has fallen during the <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs>, the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 18">Eighteenth corps</orgName> were able to cross the head of <placeName reg="White Oak Swamp, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2766789">White Oak swamp</placeName> and reach the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road, about <measure n="4.5miles" type="distance">four miles and a half</measure> below this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>On reaching the road, they formed into line of battle and advanced towards our works, thinking, evidently, that they were held only by a few cavalrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Nerved by this delusion, they came forward in fine style under the fire of our artillery; but on getting within musket range, and being met by a well-directed volley from a numerous body of veterans, their ardor abated visibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Still they came on, though unsteadily, our troops still raking them with both cannon and musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>When within <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> of our front, they broke, and the greater part fell back in disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>A considerable body took refuge under the crest of a hill, in front of our works, and there stuck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It was for a time believed by us that they were preparing to charge upon our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>After firing shrapnel at them for a considerable length of time without dislodging them, <persName n="Lyle,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Lyle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName>, with <num value="40">forty</num> of our men, sallied out on a reconnaissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He went down upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at a <hi rend="italics">pas de charge</hi> and drove them out of their position, capturing <measure n="400" type="prisoners">four hundred prisoners</measure>, among whom were several commissioned officers, and <num value="7">seven</num> stands of colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Night coming on, we made no pursuit of the main body. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> About <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> the same evening, our men in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, desiring to know what the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had there, opened upon the fort with mortars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Our bombs fell splendidly, every <num value="1">one</num> of them entering and bursting in the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> fired blew up <num value="1">one</num> of the casemates of the fort, making a breach almost big enough to drive a wagon through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The fort replied with <num value="3">three</num> rifle guns, but without much show of spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Their fire was perfectly harmless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of our men were struck, all of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> shells, except <num value="1">one</num>, flying clear over their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The <num value="1">one</num> shell alluded to struck upon our parapet, dislodging <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> shovelsful of earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> This plunder proved the loss of the day afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Although strict orders were issued that no <num value="1">one</num> should stop to plunder, a great many did so, and did not afterwards join their command; so that when our line of battle was afterwards formed on the road running through <placeName reg="Middletown, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,7014049">Middletown</placeName> perpendicular to the pike, about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the army was in the rear.--About <time value="3:30">half-past 3</time> or <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>, the enemy, having received reinforcements from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, made a simultaneous attack along our lines, at the same time flanking us with a force perpendicular to the left of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Very soon the left was compelled to give way; and as the enemy continued to advance perpendicular to our line, the whole gave way, and the enemy pressed on and drove us across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>In the confusion, the enemy's cavalry dashed upon our train just after it had crossed the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> and captured a number of wagons and some <num value="18">eighteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It is useless to disguise the fact that our army was completely stampeded.--All attempts to rally the men proved utterly useless, and they crowded down the river like droves of cattle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> Upon the whole, this fight proved much more disastrous to the enemy than to us. We lost many guns and wagons in the evening, but not so many as we had captured in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The whole field for miles was covered with the enemy's dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>I suppose, from my own observation, that at least a <num value="1000">thousand</num> of the enemy were killed and left on the field, whilst of our men I saw very few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Our loss was small compared to that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>We captured about <num value="2000">two thousand</num> of the enemy in the morning, and I am certain that we did not lose <num value="0.5">one-half</num> so many in the evening. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> The disaster was caused by the lack of troops.--The enemy's line extending some half a mile to the left of ours, we were easily flanked, and compelled to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> The contemptuous manner in which <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> speaks of our cavalry in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> is sufficiently galling to our pride; yet, if we will be content to profit by the hint he gives us, we may well afford to endure his contempt for the time being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>It is evident that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have discovered our weak point, and that <sic>that</sic> weak point is our so-called cavalry, or rather the mounted infantry that does duty under that name; for cavalry, properly so called, we have none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They have discovered it, and they have taken advantage of the discovery by attacking us upon it. We have not been able to resist the pressure, and have been twice defeated in consequence of it. But a year ago their horse was like ours, a mere body of mounted gunmen, trained to fire off their carbines and revolvers from their horses, or to dismount and fight, like sharpshooters, from behind stumps, bushes and trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They have seen that a force of this kind can be dispersed by a body of genuine cavalry, trained to charge horse to horse and man to man, for, in many instances, they have no swords, and nothing else, to receive a charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They have acted upon this discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They have <hi rend="italics">trained</hi> a portion of their force as cavalry,--<hi rend="italics">bona fide, charging,</hi> cavalry,--and they have beaten us already on <num value="2">two</num> important occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> ago we endeavored to demonstrate the necessity of having some cavalry that knew how to charge with the sabre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>We were not attended to, or we were answered that our country was of such a description that cavalry could not charge here.--The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have shown the preposterous character of this objection by training men in the style we proposed and by beating our mounted gunmen with it. That question is, therefore, settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We must have <hi rend="italics">cavalry, real cavalry,</hi> to confront the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, if we do not wish to be beaten in every battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is late in the day to begin to provide ourselves; but we must have it, and the sooner we set about it the better. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> In the first place, we want a man who is capable of making a great cavalry officer himself; <num value="1">one</num> who has the electric spark in him, and who can communicate it to his men; <num value="1">one</num> who can head a charge amidst helmets cleft and sabres clashing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We have such a man in <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>We believe him, in fact, to be the very man to place at the head of a revolution in our tactics such as is absolutely necessary if we do not wish to be everlastingly defeated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> In the second place, the <rs>Government</rs> must own the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> ago we pointed out the enormous error of trusting to the uncertain expedient of every man keeping himself provided with a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It has now been found to fail completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It has already cost the <rs>Government</rs> more than it would have done to furnish horses out of the <name>Treasury</name>, and it has added so greatly to the list of desertions &mdash; leading, as it does, constantly to horse details &mdash; that the whole country unites in <unclear></unclear> out against it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> In the third place, those mounted troops which have been beaten so constantly in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> should be dismounted and distributed among the infantry regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>In their place, men should be selected from the other branches of the service and thoroughly <hi rend="italics">drilled </hi> to the use of the sabre' and the manner of charging with it. It is impossible to depend on troops who have been so often stampeded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> Lastly, we should have camps of instruction for the cavalry, with men who thoroughly understand the use of the sword for instructors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>In the ranks of our army, men, out of number, may be found who are capable of teaching the broadsword exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>A dozen or so of those men could instruct a class of say a <num value="100">hundred</num>, and these could each instruct a certain number, and so forth, until the whole body could be instructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We believe all we have here said to be absolutely necessary, and that it has been shown to be so by recent events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It is still necessary to have mounted infantry; but their numbers must be greatly reduced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> We have the finest horsemen in the world, and yet we have not had a charge of cavalry from the beginning of the war; and now the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who are the worst riders in the world, are routing our horsemen in every encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>It is because our cavalry want wrong at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, not from their fault, but from the fault of others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> It is important to have for officers men who understand the use of the sword, and who know how to drill the cavalry as cavalry ought to be drilled.--We understand that we have not <num value="1">one</num> cavalry officer in <num value="20">twenty</num> who can defend himself with his sword if attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>This must not be any longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Our officers must be taught to use the sword, and to drill as well as lead their men in the close and deadly charge, or they must be exchanged for other officers who can do it, or who at least can learn; or lastly, we must calculate on being shamefully beaten in every battle. </p> </div3>
