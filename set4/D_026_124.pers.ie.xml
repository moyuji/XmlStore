<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>His chief reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>I apprehend, was of a political nature, since he must have foreseen that a retreat from the <rs>Rapidan</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,1127875" n="1.000 541" reg="north anna, virginia, united states">North Anna</placeName> without a battle would have at the same time unduly encouraged the enemy and discouraged our own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>This great advantage is further increased by the complete command which the enemy has of all these butlers to the sea, and of the sea itself, and by the additional circumstance that, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, the enemy can neither ascend any <num value="1">one</num> of these rivers from its mouth, nor descend any <num value="1">one</num> of them from its source, without being brought nearer to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Indeed, the defence of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> has been a heavy load on <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s back; it has tied him down to the most difficult part of the <rs>State</rs>, naturally, in which to conduct a successful defensive or offensive campaign.
