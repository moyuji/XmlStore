<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The charge was met by the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, checked, driven back upon their main body, artillery and sharpshooters &mdash; our men using pistol and sabre alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Checked again by the heavy fire of artillery and carbines the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> became somewhat confused and shattered, but they maintained their position, obeying the orders of <persName n="Rosser,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, and forming under fire, remained until the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> again gallantly charged and relieved them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Our artillery had not come up, and we were forced to rely upon pistol and sabre alone, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> using their artillery with superb ammunition, and long range carbines, subjecting us at all times to a deadly fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The position of affairs at this time would have given any General confidence in his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The men were all life &mdash; all spirit &mdash; their eyes glistened with fire, their hearts beat with chivalric valor, and their strong arms were nerved with impulse as they grasped their swords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Although disordered and scattered by so many charges, not a man shirked his duty, not <num value="1">one</num> faltered; they were determined to give the invaders another lesson!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>At this time <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, with the reckless disregard of his own life that marks this brave man, rode under fire, and, while he praised the deter mined bravery of his men, said it would not do to fight longer at such odds &mdash; he must concentrate his force &mdash; get them where be could see them, and fall back to a position of his own selection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The enemy had not gained a foot of ground since morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>We retreated slowly for nearly a mile, and took position in rear of a broad field, near a patch of woodland. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> It was in <num value="1">one</num> of the last charges before we fell back that <persName n="Pelham,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Pelham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Pelham</surname></persName> was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>He had ridden ahead of his artillery, and had gone upon the line of videttes to encourage the men by his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>His excessive gallantry coat him his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>A regiment charged by him, and rising in his stirrups, his eyes glowing like belts of fire, large drops of sweat standing upon his brow, he waved his hat in the air, his voice ringing out in exulting cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>At that moment the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> opened a heavy fire with their battery and carbines upon our advancing column, and this flower of Southern chivalry fell from his saddle mortally wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> With <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men dismounted, the enemy advanced, skirting along the woods taking advantage of every bit of cover, and soon came near enough to reach our lines, and Suneya us with their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>At this time our artillery came up, and opening upon them at once checked their advance; but they were then so close that their carbines endangered the it's of our cannot its, and it became necessary to charge them, force them back, or retire still farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>It was determined to give them no more ground, and our force was formed in line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The appearance of the battle field at this time was magnificent &mdash; no powers of the pen could do it justify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Only those who sew it can fully appreciate the beauty of the exciting picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>To our rear were woods, broad field before, divided here and there by fences; through the entire for a road, <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> and upon either side the opposing forces ready for the coming encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It was now evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The sun was rapidly sinking towards the <rs>Western</rs> horizon; the all was still, broken only by the crack of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> rifles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The firing for a moment died away and, like a momentary calm before a renewed outburst of the storm, the sounds of battle ceased. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>They rode along the line, gave their orders in a clear, distinct voice, as seemingly unconcerned as of before their bivouac fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Both behaved gloriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>At length <persName n="Lee,General,Fitz,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> gave the order to charge, and the whole line moved promptly forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>This was a signal for the enemy's fire and they now poured it in more rapidly than ever.--The <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> charged down upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> line over hillocks ditches, and every obstacle, frequently having so stop and re-form, then pressing quickly forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Upon approaching the enemy they dashed at once upon him, breaking through his line, going beyond it and then charging back again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>For a moment their pistols cracked, their sabres flashed in the air, and the <unclear></unclear> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> broke in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>On the other side of the lane the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> had also gallantly charged in the face of a heavy fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>When near the enemy the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> was stopped by a fence, and, halting there, while the bullets fell around them in showers, they removed <num value="15">fifteen</num> panels of fence, and, remounting, dashed bravely on, scattering the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cannoneers fled, their guns and their battery was virtually ours; but their reserve sharpshooters pressed forward and protected it, thus preventing our carrying it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The cannoneers then returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>In this charge both <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> participated riding ahead with the men, using both their sabres and pistols. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> Again we fall back to reform, but were not pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The brigade, although in great confusion, quickly rallied, and formed a good line face to face with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>It is true, our loss had been heavy, but we had inflicted great loss upon the enemy, and felt more determined than ever to resist his further advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>In this last charge <persName n="Rosser,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, who was wounded once before, at <placeName><persName n="Gaines,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="mostcommon:Gaines,nomatch:0"><surname>Gaines</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, was shot through the foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>His wound was received in almost the last volley fired by the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> It is impossible to say whether fear or the conviction that further attempts to advance was useless induced the enemy to withdraw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>As night drew on he made preparations to retire, and, to protect his retreat, posted as before, his dismounted sharpshooters behind the walls and fences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Our artillery opened upon them retiring and so effect anally that several dead bodies were left upon the field, and a so a number of wounded in a house &mdash; Protected very thoroughly, retreating carefully, our pursuit was befitted, and when night came they had again forded the river &mdash; gone back like whipped curs to their kennels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Many gallant individual feats were performed and many a man showed himself a hero on this day. Of course, it is impossible to collect all the interesting instances of daring there performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/><num value="1">One</num> may be mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>On the last charge, prominent among those engaged in tearing down the fence was <persName n="Fountain,Adjutant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Fountain,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant">Adjutant</roleName> <surname>Fountain</surname></persName> of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>While thus engaged he was severely wounded, but crawling away beneath the fence, when the position of the forces changed upon the field, he was enable to escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had accomplished their object they would have done us an incalculable amount of harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>A victory to them would have been hailed by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press as a harbinger of what was to come when the spring campaign opens; it would have given additional courage to <num value="1000">thousands</num> of despairing men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Our loss will amount to nearly <num value="200">two hundred</num> in killed, wounded, and prisoners, and this shows with what a determined spirit we fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>We lost no artillery or arms.--Taking all things into consideration, the render of this sketch may decide if our cavalry has done nobler work since the war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> scribes speak with the same certainly of taking <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> as they were wont to do of taking <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>It is entertaining to read their mysterious hints about the unknown and awful agencies which he undisclosed in the bosoms of their Monitors, but which, at the appointed time (a time which has already been deferred oftener than the <rs>Ascension Day</rs> of the <name>Minorities</name>) are to be let loose in irresistible power upon the devoted city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Such a generation of braggart never before occupied the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>How different the incessant clamoring of the multitudinous frogs outside the harbor and the stern silence which reigns within!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The invading horde will never occupy <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>If it over fails into their hands it will be only as a heap of smoking ruins the very site of which will be uninhabitable after the heat of summer has set in. But we don't believe that even that much consolation awaits them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>We can easily understand their impatience to defile <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> more foully than New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>They are already equating down in imagination in those majestic old churches; stationing whole regiments of their foreign braves in that specious and famous Orphan Asylum, which has sheltered and reared so many poor children of every nationality, and taking for their officers' quarters the stately old mansions of <placeName reg="The Hague, Nederland" key="tgn,7006810">the Hague</placeName>not and Cavalier aristocracy. --All and more than they have done in New Orleans do they expect to perpetrate in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>But, if ever there was a possibility that <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> could fall unmutilated into their hands it has been annihilated by their fiendish and beastly conduct in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Every citizen of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> would apply the torch to his own house sooner than see his beloved city reduced to such degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> house will be left standing for the <name>Butlers</name> to revel and riot in, even if their Monitors could force their way to the whatever of the city. --Not <num value="1">one</num> roof would be left standing to shelter the hands of the invaders from the blazing sun that would stop render life insupportable to the unacclimated, whilst our numerous and well-appointed army would fall back, leaving the foe a few barren cares on a sickly coast as a graveyard for their soldiers and sailors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> But <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, we feel a strong persuasion, is to meet no such fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>We believe that its means of defence are sufficient to set the foe at defiance, and that the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles will defend a city which without disparagement to any other may be said to have had no superior, if an equal, in the domestic virtues of its people, in its <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">catholic</rs> spirit and noble charities, in its humane provisions for the poor, the orphan, and the aged and infirm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>We have abiding confidence in the devoted courage with which it will be defended, and in the great General who, we trust, is destined to immortalize his name, not only by the successful defence of the city, but the annihistion of the invaders. </p> </div3>
