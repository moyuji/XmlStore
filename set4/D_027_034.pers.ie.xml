<head>The Northern Presidential campaign &mdash; the <rs>War</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The Presidential campaign in the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> promises at present no clear indication of the defeat of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his beastly Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The ultra Abolitionists and Fanatics, with their auxiliaries &mdash; the political buzzards who flock to parties for the garbage they may be able to pick up &mdash; have fully organized and shut the door against any arrangement by which they might have co-operated with any other party opposed to the present Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They have determined their principle and put them forth, and these are so ultra and fanatical that no other opposition party in the <rs>Federal States</rs> can concur in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Among a great many other things, they declare for the crushing of the rebellion by the destruction of its &#x0022;motive cause&#x0022; and &#x0022;principal support, slavery;&#x0022; for the &#x0022;absolute equality of all men,&#x0022; &#x0022;without distinction of color;&#x0022; for &#x0022;adequate protection for all the loyal and adequate penalties for traitors;&#x0022; for &#x0022;no amnesty to traitors short of absolute and unconditional submission; no restoration of civil privileges as an inducement to rebels to foreswear themselves,&#x0022; and, as a final and sweeping disposal of us and our effects, they declare &#x0022;that the confiscation of the lands of the rebels, and their distribution among the soldiers (negroes and whites) and actual settlers, is a measure of justice.&#x0022; Of course, no other opposition party, and certainly no peace party can co-operate with these <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They are much worse than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In their platform they raise issues with the party in power about the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> free speech, free prise, integrity and economy in the administration of the <rs>Government</rs>, etc.; but had they the power, we should see that they would respect as little individual and State rights as <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>; and judging from <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>'s wasteful and corrupt expenditures in the <orgName n="Department of Missouri" type="department">Missouri department</orgName>, when under him, we should likely find his Administration at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> quite equal to the present <num value="1">one</num> in every species of fraud and extravagance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Touching the war and us poor rebels, these fanatics and blackguards are clearly of opinion that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> does not conduct the invasion with sufficient energy, and that he does not pursue us with half the severity and loudly and vehemently that the measures of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> towards us are too lenient, too soothing and coaxing; that we should be bowed down by unconditional submission, and should relinquish all our property to boot to be handed over to the soldiers of the <rs>Federal</rs> army ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> This frantic organization of the fanatics, disappointed politicians, the vultures and jackals hovering around for offal, has made all its nominations, and is fairly in the field, canvassing with might and main.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The Peace party, which has not yet made its nomination, cannot coalesce with this monstrous organism; and the prospect is that there will be <num value="2">two</num> parties running against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This will so far express the hope of the triumph of either that neither will, in the race, have the advantage of the support of that large body of tide-waiters who cast their votes on the winning side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The opposition thus divided, this class would more than likely go over to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, satisfied that the joker could more easily defeat <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num> than <num value="1">one</num></hi> competitor in the political field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> That there is enough in the attitude of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> &mdash; its immense debt &mdash; its futile warits outrages on the rights of individuals and communities &mdash; its corruptions and its extravagances &mdash; to defeat it before the people, seems to be clear; and opposed by <num value="1">one</num> strong party, its defeat would be more than probable; but that opposition divided can hardly do more than throw the election of <rs type="role2">President</rs> into the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, where the sequel would be altogether problematical. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Under this view, the idea of the defeat of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is at least doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The South would prefer his continuance in office to the success of <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He is a man of more force and sagacity than <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>; but his schemes and measures are well understood, and his policy envelopes him like a cocoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>There is no new force to be employed by him. He is exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A new man might inspire the <rs>Northern</rs> hordes with a new notion, and might make a new flout and a new spasm in the dying out of the crusade against the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> In the hand of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, it may be that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is to be continued the rod and the terror over the complaining and discontented North, in order to leave no hope for relief but in that direct resistance which alone can check that <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> tyranny centralized at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Furthermore, it may be intended by the continuation of this <name>Pharaoh</name> in power, to drive the burdened and impatient Northwest into that withdrawal from all association with the <rs>Northeast</rs> which is her only refuge from oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>She is the fat ass bearing the burdens of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> manufacturers &mdash; she succeeds the <rs>South</rs> as the payer of fishing bounties and protective tariffs, to pour wealth into the pockets of the lords of the loom and the codfish aristocracy of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>As <name n="God" type="God">God</name> hardened <persName><foreName>Pharaoh</foreName></persName>'s heart, in order that the <name>Israelites</name> might not relapse into apathy and contentment, so <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s government is possibly to be continued in all its odiousness and oppression to drive the <rs>Northern States</rs> and people to the only measures for the preservation of their independence and liberties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The South is taking care of herself as she is able to do. It is for the <rs>North</rs> to take care of herself as she is able to do. It is for the <rs>North</rs> to take care of herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is especially for the <rs>Northwest</rs> to look to her future; and whatever the result of the <name>Presidential</name> election in the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, she will never find rest until, in the language of <num value="1">one</num> of her own citizens, she &#x0022;follows the bright sparkling waters of the <rs>Ohio</rs> down to the &#x0027;<rs type="role" reg="Father">Father</rs> of Waters&#x0027;--down to the <name>Ocean</name> of Peace&#x0022;--until she carries out the design of which a <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> Congressman from <placeName key="tgn,7007515" n="1.000 1232" reg="maine">Maine</placeName> accuses her, viz.: to &#x0022;establish a Western Confederacy.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> or no <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, there is a plenty of discord and turmoil at the <rs>North</rs> to engender strife and division irreconcilable; and whatever the result of the political canvass going on, we shall see their fruits in due season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In the meantime, as we always conclude on these subjects, the brave Southern armies must essentially aid in solving the problem of Northern polities. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The signal was now given, the fuse lighted, and in less time than it takes to write it, up went the solid earth to the heights of about <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure>, carrying the news-gatherers along with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The enemy immediately opened their batteries, and their infantry manned the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Our artillery replied vigorously, but no charge was ever intended to be made by us, and consequently the enemy were greatly disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Our experiment accomplished all that it was expected to accomplish, and our officers expressed themselves as highly satisfied at the result. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> In assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the government needed at <num value="2500">2500</num>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or blood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value </hi> we impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have constructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to substitute in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> The terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or price for a number of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <num value="2500">2500</num> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> In Illustration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, he classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient, or able to render good service for a year of so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fail below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &#x0026;c. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> Since the adoption of our Schedules for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed <num value="33">thirty three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to render any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Therefore, we assess the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules, impressed since the passage of the currency, bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly as each horses or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horse or mule whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forthwith call on all of those persons of whom shay impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>But allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our average appraisement, <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, as a fair medium value on. This then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> and a minimum price of <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the inferior, as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should in all such cases themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.
