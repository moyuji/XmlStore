<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He was opposed to the idea of a Central Confederacy, and if the question were presented to him to-day, where would he go?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was due to the <rs>Border Slave States</rs> that they should consult together before taking united action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>An attempt to collect the revenue now would be at war with those interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He meant to assume no position here in conflict with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He still believed in the <rs>Union</rs>, and that a wise and proper course would yet make the happiest, freest, grandest country on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was undoubtedly a declaration of war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The report of the <rs>Committee</rs> of <num value="33">Thirty-three</num>, of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, met with my cordial approval, and I have never hesitated to declare my belief that a Convention of all the <name>States</name>, to consider actual or supposed grievances, was the proper and most available remedy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> My confidence in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people is such that I believe no just complaint can long exist without a redress at their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>There is always a remedy in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>With this view, I still declare my willingness to join in measures of compromise. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> I would do so because of the ancient ties that have bound us together under institutions framed by our fathers and under a Constitution signed by the immortal <rs>Washington</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> I believe that no former Speaker ever received more kindness at the hands of this <name>House</name>, than has fallen to my lot. Amid all the conflicts of opinion on questions continually arising, you have never overruled any decision I have made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>I do not infer from this that I was always right; but I do infer that if wrong, the <rs type="place">House</rs> believed it was through misapprehension and not by design, and that it was your magnanimity which led you to sustain the <name>Chair</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> You will permit me, I hope, to say that I am under great obligations to the officers of the <rs type="place">House</rs> for their assistance and devotion to my comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>I return them all my very warmest thanks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> And now, gentlemen and friends, it only remains that I take my leave of you. The parting hour is an honest hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came among you, I declared myself a National man. I am so still, I trust, and shall ever so remain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> Often, in retired moments, I shall think of you and the many scenes through which we have passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>My prayer to Heaven for you is, that you may have that blessing which cometh from above, and that the <name>Great Ruler</name> of Nations in whose hands are the destinies of us all, may restore peace to our country, bring order out of confusion, and union to its present distracted elements.
