<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> The reader may form some idea of the way men suspected of Southern proclivities are treated in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, by a perusal of the following record of horror which we find in the <orgName n="Saint Louis Republican" type="newspaper">St. Louis <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi></orgName>, Union paper: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> As it is hardly possible that the outrage which we are about to describe will fail to find its way to the public car, perhaps in a still more exaggerated form, we transcribe what seems to be a very fair account of the essential particulars from the letter of a correspondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>We had hoped that, after the unwarranted killing of <persName n="Field,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="mostcommon:Field,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Field</surname></persName>, in <placeName reg="Pettis, Missouri, United States" key="tgn,2001229">Pettis county</placeName>, and after the fight, from before the court martial, of the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> who committed that act of barbarity, thereby confessing his guilt, we should have been spared, by the good conduct of the <rs>Union</rs> troops, the recital of any similar act of atrocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>We notice this case now to call the attention of the military authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>They will see that it has none of the attributes which are specified in military orders, and justify the nilling of rebels when found with arms in their hands. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Suspecting no farm, though finding the grounds guarded they advanced towards than resilience, when <persName n="Lasley,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00372" reg="nearbymention:Lasley,James,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lasley</surname></persName> was ordered to get down and go to <unclear>Palmy </unclear> He replied, that they must permit him to enter the house and get a thicker coat, as he would be <unclear></unclear> all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>This they positively denied, telling him that the coat he had would do him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>Having separated these <num value="3">three</num> gentlemen from the indies whom they had escorted from the church, the officer in command addressed some very insulting words to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>The dreadful truth that they wore to be shot at once flashed across <persName n="Lasley,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="nearbymention:Lasley,James,M.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lasley</surname></persName>'s mind, and she darted to join her husband and share his fate, but was caught and held by <num value="1">one</num> of the young ladies present just as <persName n="Lasley,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="nearbymention:Lasley,James,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lasley</surname></persName> and young <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="nearbymention:Price,James,,,"><surname>Price</surname></persName> fell, having been shot dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>It is proper further to say that <persName n="Lasley,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="nearbymention:Lasley,James,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lasley</surname></persName> had taken the oath of allegiance and was under a heavy bond; that young <persName n="Ridgeway,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00381" reg="mostcommon:Ridgeway,nomatch:0"><surname>Ridgeway</surname></persName> was also under oath and bond, and that <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="nearbymention:Price,James,,,"><surname>Price</surname></persName> was only <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> old. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/> Before this crime was committed, it was alleged that the soldiery had taken possession of <persName n="Las,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="mostcommon:Las,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Las</surname></persName> ley's house &mdash; had helped themselves to everything they wanted &mdash; had partaken of a good dinner which the cook was ordered to prepare for them, and had destroyed many household articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>We feel sure that our military authorities will not permit our outrage to go without investigation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> Although this <unclear></unclear> has found its way to the public car, we know of no redress, and the murderers of those inoffensive Missourian are still suffered to go at large, and are considered good Union soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Alluding to this act of Vandalic cruelty, a Northern paper has the manliness to utter the following notes of warning: <q>&#x0022;As <persName n="Gamble,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00384" reg="mostcommon:Gamble,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Gamble</surname></persName> does not appear to have power to control these acts in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, we hope <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00385" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> will see to them at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Our cause musfail, sooner or later, if those who are loyal, or those who are ready and willing to submit to the jurisdiction of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, are thus to be waylaid and slain after submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>It is folly to spend breath in showing what must be the effect of such proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>All history is full of warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The attempt of the <rs>French Monarch</rs> to exterminate the <name>Huguenots</name> was not a success, for there are <num value="1000">thousands</num> of their descendants yet living to tell the horrid tale, and rise in judgment against the actors in that terrible scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>A good cause managed and controlled by good men, requires no such brutality, and never did.
