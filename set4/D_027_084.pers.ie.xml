<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The quiet of this place was considerably disturbed by an unfortunate occurrence which took place here yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><persName n="Henderson,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Henderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Henderson</surname></persName> and several others were advertised to address the citizens of this county on that day, and the <rs>Lincoln</rs> men had also appointed a county meeting for the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Afterwards, the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> appointed a meeting for the same time and place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>At about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time>, it was announced that <persName n="Henderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Henderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Henderson</surname></persName> was about to commence speaking at the court-house, and everybody was invited up to hear him. The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> were invited to go, and told that, notwithstanding other speakers were advertised, they would give way so soon as <persName n="Henderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Henderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Henderson</surname></persName> got through speaking, and they could have an opportunity of replying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They refused, however, to accept the invitation, and announced that the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> would hold a meeting at the church, and <persName n="Campbell,,R.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Campbell,R.,A.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName> would address them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> He relates that, after a considerable number of persons had gathered in the church, some <num value="3">three</num> soldiers came into the church and asked what kind of a meeting they were holding there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Some person in the crowd replied, &#x0022;It is our meeting, and you had better get out of here; &#x0022; upon which a fist and skull fight commenced between <num value="1">one</num> of the soldiers and <num value="1">one</num> of the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>A man by the name of <persName n="Sanford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><surname>Sanford</surname></persName> was fighting with a soldier, and had knocked him back, very nearly down, when a man by the name of <persName n="Reed,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Reed,nomatch:0"><surname>Reed</surname></persName> started up to where they were fighting, and at the same time commenced drawing his revolver, which hung in the scabbard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Another soldier, seeing this, drew his revolver and shot <persName n="Reed,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Reed,nomatch:0"><surname>Reed</surname></persName> through the heart, from which he died in a few minutes.--Several volleys were then exchanged between the citizens and soldiers, resulting in wounding <persName n="Sanford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><surname>Sanford</surname></persName> in the arm and thigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>None of the soldiers, were hurt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> These are the facts as near as I can learn them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>So soon as it was known that a disturbance had occurred, the military was at once called out and order again restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>None of the soldiers on duty were in the difficulty &mdash; but some soldiers that were at home on furlough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> P.

Citizens, who examined the church since the difficulty, say that most of the shots are from small revolvers, of much smaller calibre than those used by the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The soldier who was there without arms says that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pistol was fired at him by a citizen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The following order has just been issued at <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>: </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Recent events in this city have made it necessary that some rule of conduct be adopted for the government of troops at this post in their attendance upon political meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The soldier has the same political rights as a citizen, and when not on duty or restrained by post regulations, is not to be denied the privileges of an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> freeman in hearing discussions and deliberating upon the grave questions which involve the destiny of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But a Republic may justly be jealous of military interference with rights so sacred as those of free assemblages and free discussion for all legitimate purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Reflection will teach the intelligent soldier that he, the chosen custodian of law and defender of constitutional rights, should be the last man in the <rs>Republic</rs> to do violence to the very principles he is called to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A faithful soldier is the most exalted type of a patriot; he should permit no man to excel him in devotion to established rights, and should scorn to cast a stain upon the honor of his high vocation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> If there is a lawless abuse of liberty in our community, working evil to the <rs>Government</rs>; if disloyal sentiments are uttered at political meetings, your superior officers, when the military authority ought so to do, will interfere to arrest and punish the guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The soldier may rest assured that his rights, also, shall be duly respected, and that studied insults offered shall not go unrebuked and unpunished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But action in these matters must be left to his superior officers, who are responsible for the proper discharge of their official duties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> It is therefore ordered: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is of a character so grave, and comes from a source so worthy of credit, that we trust it may not be overlooked: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> &#x0022;There is a remark which we feel it to be a duty to make before concluding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The anxious hurry of <hi rend="italics">preparation,</hi> which was exhibited by officers having superintendence on the north side, after the time for preparation had passed, showed that there had been a previous neglect, by no means to be commended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The weak and undefended state of a position after wards pronounced important &mdash; we allude to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>--remains to be explained to the public satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The necessity of turning the departmental officers and employees of the <rs>Government</rs> into diggers and spaders, to remedy a grave deficiency in the defences at another point, disclosed, it would seem, by the exigency now past, is no compliment to the foresight or vigilance in which we have been confiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We must add another word: There was an exhibition of excitement, in some cases just where there had been this apparent want of previous vigilance, that was by no means inspiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>And as the result proved these anxious apprehensions to have been ill-founded, the judgment as well as the serenity of those who exhibited them is brought in question.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Sentinel"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> The <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> is well known to be friendly to the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>These remarks, therefore, cannot possibly be attributed to any desire on the part of the writer to excite anything like a feeling of bitterness against it on the part either of the citizens or of any other person whatsoever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>They are evidently extorted by a view of the whole situation from a man who was in a condition to know it, and who, knowing it, could do no less than call attention to it. That there was gross neglect <hi rend="italics">before</hi> the approach of the enemy, is but too apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>That there was disgraceful hurry and unnecessary trepidation after it was announced, is matter of notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>These facts have raised a painful inquiry among the citizens of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as to the competency of some persons entrusted with our defence, and we respectfully suggest that it ought to be listened to.--If <num value="0.5">one-half</num> we have heard be true, then certainly there ought to be a change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>No man ought to be entrusted with any military charge about <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> who is not confident that it can be held against all odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It ought to be recollected that there are croaking officers as well as croaking citizens; and it is reasonable to believe that an officer of this character would not make the best defender in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It is well known that there were persons who, <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> ago, recommended the abandonment of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and we may be sure that there are others who take a like gloomy view of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>If there be any such, most assuredly they ought not to be entrusted with any command about this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>If a man thinks a place cannot be defended, we may be sure he will give it up if he be requested by the enemy to do so. Witness, <persName n="Anderson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Fort Gaines, Clay, Georgia" key="tgn,2022920">Fort Gaines</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Its importance to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is well known to <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It is, in fact, the most important place in the whole Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> know that as well as we do. If it be taken, we lose the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, in all probability; and the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> is, unquestionably and unmistakably, the backbone of the <name>Confederation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>It is strange, then, that its defence should be entrusted to men who loiter away the time when they should be preparing everything for a crisis; and that too in sight of the enemy, and who, when that crisis comes, are too excited to do anything in the world, who lose all the little sense they ever had, and then begin to talk of preparation when it is already too late. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The country has since been infested with birds of the same color, but greater respectability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>They are turkey-buzzards this time, and they come in quest of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> carcasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>From this, we judge that the salt has lost its savor, otherwise there would not be such a &#x0022;melodious smell&#x0022; in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Now, we have no doubt the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> thinks it a sad thing to cheat the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It is a thing he never does himself, and never likes to see done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>He therefore, probably, feels obliged to <persName n="Echols,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Echols,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Echols</surname></persName> for the present he has made to the grave, in which he seems to have a personal interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>But probably his obligation will not be so strong on another score.

The more we reflect upon it the more does it assume the plain, unmistakable features of a cold-blooded, deliberate, demoniac murder, for which, if justice has not left the earth, the perpetrators will yet be visited with the retribution such a crime deserves.
