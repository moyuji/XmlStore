<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> --We have heard from refugees from <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName> most interesting accounts of a scene which occurred some time since in that city, in which a venerable man withstood the rage of a brutal mob and made it cower before the presence of courageous principle and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/><persName n="Whelan,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Whelan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Whelan</surname></persName>, the <rs>Bishop</rs> of the <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> Diocese of the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName>, resides in that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>He will be remembered by many of our readers as the former <rs>Bishop</rs> of the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName> in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and the <rs>Eastern Diocese</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>He was universally respected here by all denominations as a learned and pious prelate, whilst the rare benevolence and peculiar gentleness of his character, and his unaffected simplicity, yet dignity, made him as much be loved as respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>We have seldom looked upon a countenance which was so expressive of purity and gentleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The unobtrusiveness and propriety of his demeanor were the subject of frequent comment among all classes of our citizens, and he devoted himself to his pastoral duties with the most entire abstinence from all matters not pertaining to his sacred calling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Nevertheless, it was impossible for even such a man to be an unmoved spectator of the recent events which threatened to involve the rights, liberty, and life of all his fellow-citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>He had too just an idea of the theory of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Constitution and the <rs>Federal</rs> system to blind his eyes to the gross perversion and outrages upon the charter of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> liberty by the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>He was too pure and honest to profess what he did not believe, and to acknowledge fealty where he did not consider it due. Having undoubting faith in State Rights, and no faith whatever in Black Republicanism, he felt that his allegiance was due to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and not to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abram,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Yet, although he had silently and quietly pursued the even tenor of his way, he was suspected of unsoundness on the great issues of the day. The mob of <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>, than which a grosser, more servile and besotted mob cannot be found anywhere, required every man to show his hands, and gloated in the license given them by the despotism they served of violating the sanctify of dwellings they never presumed to enter before, of arraigning their superiors in these homes, while in monarchical <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> are castles which even the <rs>King</rs> cannot enter, and of insulting gentlemen in whose presence they always felt their inferiority and vulgarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Among the many estimable people who became the object of their malignity was <persName n="Whelan,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Whelan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Whelan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>They rushed wildly to the <rs type="place">Cathedral</rs> and to the <rs type="place">Bishop's house</rs> near it, and demanded that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag should be hoisted on the church.--In response to their clamor, the <rs>Bishop</rs> soon made his appearance &mdash; a tall, spare-built old gentleman, with silvery hair and serene countenance &mdash; he stood before them and listened to their demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Undaunted, deliberately, yet firmly, he replied in substance:--that he stood before them an old man, a citizen of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and a Bishop of the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Personally and privately he entertained opinions differing entirely from those of the persons before him. He was a friend of State-Rights and acknowledged his allegiance to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>He was a Bishop of the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName>, an institution universal in its character, intended for all time, and independent of parties and political organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The banner of that Church was the <name>Cross</name> of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, it knew no other; that it would be improper to place in its stead the banner which that multitude carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Therefore he refused to yield to their demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>He was an old man with a short time to live, and but <num value="1">one</num> against their hundreds; but before they placed their flag on that church, they must pass over his dead body. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The mob was quiet, it cowered before the earnest old <rs type="role2">Bishop</rs>, and --went away. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>As to the flag, we have already given reasons why anything that resembles it is likely to produce collisions in action between our own soldiers; apart from the odium that belongs to what is now an emblem of an in human despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>It is no longer the flag of the <rs>Free</rs>; it is the flag of the tyrant and the oppressor, and is stained with the blood of our sons and brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>At the same time, we would give up nothing to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that is worth keeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>They are by no means satisfied with any national anthems, for they have offered a prize for a new <num value="1">one</num>; but even their money cannot produce the music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> <num value="1">One</num> noticeable peculiarity of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> society is its decided penchant for the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>You see evidences of it on every side, and sights in the streets quite other than those observed in an inland town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The ladies seem to have a different manner and carriage; the men dress in navy blue and wear the navy cap; the yards and gardens are laid off and kept in navy-yard style; the marine views that hang in every drawing-room; the number of <placeName reg="South-Sea">South-Sea</placeName> shells that adorn the mantles; the models of ships in the store windows; the shops bordering the water filled with fancy articles to please Jack Tar; the signs upon the various offices and ware houses would all mark it as a seaport city, aside from the view of its broad and beautiful harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>To <num value="1">one</num> fond of the sea, who has been a long time separated from it, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> breath of the salty air brings with it new life and vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> Being, as I presume all are aware, the most important <orgName n="Naval Station" type="station">naval station</orgName> on this continent, the people have a right to be proud of its reputation, and cannot be blamed for having once considered the navy their own peculiar property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>When the <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States navy</orgName> was in its glory, life here consisted of very strongly marked ups and downs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> Time and the revolution have failed to drive this feeling of love for the navy alone, out of the hearts of the people &mdash; and why should they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>This olden love is hard to forget, and there is now many a young girl whose heart beats high at the sight of the eagle and the anchor, and many a dear old belle who still cherishes her fondness for the navy blue.
