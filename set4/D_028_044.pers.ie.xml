<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> does not treat the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with that respect which is due to youth from old age. The immense naval armaments of <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> do not excite that astonishment and consternation in the Old World which he had a right to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They have the effrontery in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to be amused with the bravado of the <rs>Federals</rs> because they have <num value="700">seven hundred</num> ships-of-war, mounting nearly <num value="5000">five thousand</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A private letter from <persName n="London,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:London,nomatch:0"><surname>London</surname></persName>, published in the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer,</hi> says that, &#x0022;setting aside the improvements already made in gunnery, machinery, or structure &mdash; and they are more considerable than is talked about; setting aside what is now being done in that way &mdash; and it is much more than is generally known; we (the <rs>English</rs>) have at this instant a navy consisting of <num value="16">sixteen</num> ships, of <num value="100">one hundred</num> guns and upwards, averaging, collectively, <num value="1820">one thousand eight hundred and twenty</num> guns, and engines of <measure n="11200horsepower">11,200 horse power</measure>; we have <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> ships, carrying <num value="90">ninety</num> or <num value="91">ninety-one</num> guns each, mounting more than <num value="5300">five thousand three hundred</num> guns altogether, with engines of over <measure n="16000horsepower">16,000-horse power</measure>; we have <num value="21">twenty-one</num> gun vessels, varying from <num value="40">40</num> to <measure n="160horsepower">160-horse power</measure> each, and <num value="200">two hundred</num> gunboats, varying from <num value="20">20</num> to <measure n="60horsepower">60-horse power</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Now, leaving out vessels of the ram species, we show an aggregate of <num value="840">eight hundred and forty</num> regular war ships, mounting more than <num value="7600">seven thousand six hundred</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Remember that, of this enormous aggregate, every vessel was especially constructed for naval purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><hi rend="italics">Per contra,</hi> remember that, out of the <num value="700">seven hundred</num> vessels now boasted as the <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States navy</orgName>, only <num value="236">two hundred and thirty-six</num> were expressly built for the navy or for naval use, and that number includes all their valueless iron-clads and old vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Need I point out the importance of this fact, as it goes to exhibit the innate weakness of the numerous, but comparatively powerless, navy of the <rs>Federals</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>And yet they cry to us, &#x0027;Marry, come on, &#x0027; like the clown in the circus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They admit that all the navy-yards in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> combined would not offer as many facilities for the construction of war vessels as the least of the regular navy-yards in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What chance, then, is there in their favor in case of the pressures arising from a war with us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is true, they could, for a time, annoy, and perhaps seriously injure, our commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>That difficulty, however, would be of a transient character, or soon mastered, if <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> put a hand in the business with us; if not as an active ally, at least as a sheltering <num value="1">one</num>, or <num value="1">one</num> that would engage to take no advantage of us. It is in the doubt we entertain of that identical point that any of our misgivings, as a people, are centred.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> These are facts which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will do well to digest before it bursts its breeches in the conceit of naval supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Neither <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> nor <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> have been indifferent spectators of naval operations in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, nor deaf to the boastful shouts which have been set up in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of what they intend to do. Whilst all this absurd uproar has been going on in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>English</rs> have been quietly working out <num value="2">two</num> navies, either of which would crush the fleets of the <rs>Union</rs> like a nutshell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>No light of science, or experience, has been wanting; no expense, no labor, no resource of industry or art, omitted to make their work perfect. &#x0022;At this moment,&#x0022; says the letter from which we quote, &#x0022;<placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> are pushing, to its most practical issue, every point in the proof-armor theory, <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> though they have not yet decided that the ram is of much general use. <num value="3">Three</num>-deckers are undergoing the iron improvement, with other alterations looking to speed and mobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Staunch old ships are being razed, with dense metal plates, and furnished with the best and most powerful engines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Several wrought iron vessels, of huge dimensions and wonderful strength, are on the ways, for what unusual service only the <name>Powers</name> that be know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><num value="4">Four</num> of this formidable class have already been finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If impenetrability can be attained to by human skill, these vessels will have it; but there is no unity of opinion as to their practical efficiency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> &#x0022;The friends of the <rs>Federals</rs>, here, say they have, or will have, secured this desideratum &mdash; invulnerability &mdash; in their new iron vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I much doubt it, and think it more than likely that the necessities of the war and the hurry-scurry of over-eager contractors has foiled, and will foil, their hopes and plans in that important particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Moreover, they have been in the habit of getting from our foundries whatever is essential to it, and they are not allowed to get any more &mdash; except the refuse of our own navy, and to that their foes would make them welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>All the new line-of-battle ships of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, as well as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, are built of timber, cased in iron; but they are adapted to great speed.--The main advantage we seek to secure in these is not so much impregnability as perfection in other qualities &mdash; great mobility and stability under pressure, an immense stowage, ample fighting room, an unyielding platform for the guns, and such construction as must secure the completest &#x0027;handiness&#x0027; in action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> &#x0022;Notwithstanding the surprising transformation in naval architecture, superinduced by your war, and suggested by the late <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> war, the <rs>Surveyor</rs> of the <rs>British Admiralty</rs> still declares that until it shall have been satisfactorily ascertained that the great length which is necessary to high speed under steam alone does not materially interfere with the ready performance of the evolutions which may be required of men-of-war under any circumstances, it would not be prudent to depart otherwise than gradually, and after sufficient experience, from the dimensions and forms of the ships which have been found to possess every good property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This has been tested in every recent instance of a new vessel, and has led to the adoption of a system which the <rs>Lords</rs> of the <rs>Admiralty</rs> do not choose to disclose, but of which our naval proficient speak with proud confidence.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The writer gives the following reasons for going into these naval particulars:-- &#x0022;Because the extraordinary naval energy of <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName>, just now at peace, is very significant; because the <hi rend="italics">Naval and <persName n="Gazette,,Military,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Gazette,Military,,,"><foreName>Military</foreName> <surname>Gazette</surname></persName>,</hi> a semi-official paper, has lately been taking great pains to hold the naval pretensions of the <rs>Federals</rs> up to ridicule; because the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> squadrons are being changed, and all the less-trusted vessels are being sent to do duty far from the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> coast; because the <rs>Federals</rs> show they expect &#x0027;something,&#x0027; and, on the principle that &#x0027;whom the gods would destroy they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> make mad,&#x0027; they are irritating us and thwarting <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> to precipitate that &#x0022;something&#x0022;; because, in a naval war against <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, or either, they could, at present, make only a short, and it would be a spirited, resistance; because where the <rs>Federals</rs> think themselves strongest they are weakest, and where they think they are acting most wisely they are acting most foolishly; because--&#x0027;coming events cast their shadows.&#x0027; If any <num value="1">one</num> of these &#x0027;because&#x0027; suggests nothing to you of itself, at least the facts I give you are not worthless in themselves.&#x0022; In addition to these facts, the fortifications proceeding in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> have their significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must not expect either <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to fall an easy prey to their designs. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> It often happens to navigators that, returning from a long voyage with a rich cargo, they are threatened with ship-wreck on their own shores, and are compelled, in order to save the ship and their lives, to lighten the vessel by throwing overboard a part, if not all, of the cargo that had been obtained at great cost and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We have never heard of <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> a mariner who hesitated to make that sacrifice when it became necessary, however disagreeable it might be to his feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Those who think to retain arms for their own defence should remember that if the army cannot protect them the arms will be of little use.--While no valid title can be acquired to public arms and equipments, except from the <rs>Government</rs>, it is reported that many persons have ignorantly purchased them from private parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.
