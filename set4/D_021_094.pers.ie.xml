<head>The news and the public.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> All our city contemporaries seem to be employed in discussing the extent to which war news ought to be communicated to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We do not see why we, too, should not take a hand in the discussion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> We think it very proper in a General to take steps for preventing the communication of army movements through the press, or through any other channel, to the public, unless it be such as relates to transactions already known to the public, or such as he himself expressly permits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The reason upon which such restriction is founded is too obvious to require notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>It would, indeed, be a good general rule to allow only such news to transpire as may have received the sanction of the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War office</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Yet it seems to us that when a great battle has been fought &mdash; no matter what may be the result &mdash; the public should be put in possession of the facts, let the result be what it may, as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> always kept <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> supplied with such intelligence as he chose to communicate relative to his movements, through his bulletins, which formed, in fact, a concise and satisfactory history of the war. In the same way, it seems to us, our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> might send reports of their, movements, which might be laid before the public, all things which it might be improper to make known having been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> carefully excluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The publication of such reports, as soon as received would answer a good purpose in more ways than <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It would put an end to the enormously exaggerated rumors by which the public are liable to be distressed every moment in the day. It would soothe the minds of the people, if there is nothing really alarming, and enable them to look their situation calmly in the face, if there is. We should not see them at <num value="1">one</num> moment exalted to the skies by hope, and at the next cast down to the earth by despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>They would be sure of having the truth, whatever it might be, whether good or bad. Nothing can be more detrimental to a cause, among those who adhere to it, than false statements with regard to successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The truth will be sure to come out at last, and, when a victory is claimed where a defeat has been sustained, the reaction in the public mind is always proportionate to its previous exaltation as soon as the truth leaks out. <num value="1">One</num> of our contemporaries alludes to a curious instance of this, related by <persName n="Polybius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Polybius,nomatch:0"><surname>Polybius</surname></persName>, in his narrative of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> Punic war. A <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> consul, whose army had been almost entirely destroyed in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of those tremendous defeats which <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> inflicted upon his countrymen, wrote home that he had gained a victory, although he had not the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> part of his army around his banners, and had retreated or rather fled some <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> from the scene of conflict.--The Senate proclaimed it to the people, and the people were intoxicated with joy. In the mean time, however, stragglers began to come in at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> singly, then in couples, finally in bands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>All of them told the same tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>They had been beaten on the bloodiest field <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> had ever seen until that day. The reaction was tremendous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/><placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> was mad with despair, overwhelmed with grief, incapable, from consternation, of taking council for the general safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It were better had the flattering tale never been told.--This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lying bulletin of which we have any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>There have been many since, and none of them have been productive of good, so far as we can learn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> Truth is always best, under all circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>In war it is especially so. We do not mean that a General should blab out his secrets, or that the <rs>Government</rs> should tell what it is improper to divulge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>But when it has ascertained the truth with regard to any operation in which the public is deeply interested, and when it is not important to keep it back, then out with it at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Let it be laid at once before the people. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The Virginia in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> As we anticipated, the success of the <rs>Virginia</rs> has excited much attention in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and the press earnestly recommend that no more wooden ships of war be constructed, but that vessels on the plan of the <rs>Virginia</rs> be adopted for harbor defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>As a bulwark against that never-ending source of apprehension, a French invasion, vessels of the class of the <rs>Virginia</rs>, stationed in every <name>English</name> harbor, would render the fast anchored isle impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>A friend, however, suggests that the advantage will not be altogether on the side of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, but that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> will derive benefits from it which will more than counter-balance those to be reaped by her ancient rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The introduction of steam has already, to a great degree, neutralized the naval supremacy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> over her rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The <rs>French</rs>, whilst the best soldiers in the world, have never been able to attain the maritime aptitude and seamanship of the <rs>English</rs>; but these qualities have been no longer essential since the introduction of steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Soldiers are almost as good as sailors in the management of steam vessels &mdash; quite as good, with a little training, in such vessels as the <rs>Virginia</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>What is to hinder the <rs>French</rs> from building such vessels also, and, when necessity requires, shutting up the gates of the <name>Mediterranean</name>, and even blocking up the avenues of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to her East <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> possessions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/><placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> can do the same thing, provided that vessels constructed like the <rs>Virginia</rs> can be made seaworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It may thus be that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, in leaving her own race in the <rs>South</rs> to work out their own salvation, has prepared the way for her own destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The wonderful experiment in the waters of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is destined to neutralize the naval warfare of the world, and perhaps to cause the downfall of some of its mightiest powers. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The <rs>Privates</rs> in the <rs>Southern</rs> army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> We do not believe that the world has ever seen such material as compose the rank and file of the <rs>Southern</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> never led a braver and better set of men. In many respects they are superior even to the veterans of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, for they are animated by higher motives and have made greater sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>They have left comfortable homes, where none of them ever knew the want of <num value="1">one</num> single thing necessary to human comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Unlike the troops of the <rs>North</rs>, they have not been forced into the army to obtain a subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>On the contrary, they have entered the army voluntarily, and given up the comfortable subsistence which they were sure of at home for the purpose of serving their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>They have lived upon such food and dressed in such clothes as they would not have given to their own negroes; they have slept upon the bare earth, and been exposed to the summer sun and the winter snows, for the pure and unselfish love of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>They have not been animated by any vulgar love of glory, by any ideas of conquest, and far less of spoils and rapine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Many of them are men of property, not a few of wealth, and all accustomed to ease and comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>They are willing to do anything, to endure anything, to dare anything in defence of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>All honor to their officers, but their officers honor themselves most in honoring their men. We feel no such reverence for any class of men, in camp or council, as for those noble men in the ranks, those noblemen of nature, who are fighting not for fame or gold, but for country, and indifferent whether their names are ever inscribed upon the records of glory, so that <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> they do their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>But they will have their reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Their names are written upon the imperishable scrolls of that tribunal which awards such prizes hereafter to virtue in its humbles estate as earth has no power to bestow. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> In claiming a great victory at <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, the New Yorkers exhibit their usual genius for lying on a grand scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>There never was but <num value="1">one</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> defeat in the war which they did not claim as a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>That was the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, and they would have claimed that if it had not occurred under the very eyes of the whole world near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, so that evasion and concealment were quite impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>In acknowledging that they lost, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>--some of them say <num value="23000">twenty-three thousand</num>--at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, they have unconsciously given us valuable information, and rendered their victory, even upon their own showing, <num value="5">five</num> times as disastrous as their defeat at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We had not supposed that more than <num value="5000">five thousand</num> of the invaders had been annihilated; but here is <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of their splendid army cut to pieces by a force of half their number, indifferently armed with double- barrel shot-guns, pikes, and <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>If such weapons can produce such results, it shows, after all, that it is the <hi rend="italics">men</hi> on whom we must depend for victories and not the fire-arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It matters not much what is the weapon, so long as it is wielded by a <hi rend="italics">man.</hi> They claim that they killed about <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, which is within <num value="5000">five thousand</num> of the whole number we had on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The truth is, we did not lose <num value="2000">two thousand</num>; but if <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> had been killed, it would only prove, as we heard a distinguished gentleman remark, that a people who fight to the death in that style can never be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> account is of course intended for foreign consumption, but they have long ago learned abroad not to believe a word that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> say. Whether they believe it or not, however, is a matter of the most supreme indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>We intend to fight this battle out without asking the favor of anybody, and to be under obligations to no earthly power for our deliverance from despotism. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/> Here began scenes which, let us hope, will have no parallel in our remaining annals of the war. Many, particularly among our officers, were not yet out of bed. Others were dressing, others washing, others cooking, a few eating their breakfasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Many guns were unleaded, accoutrements lying pell mell, ammunition was ill supplied &mdash; in short, the camps were completely surprised &mdash; disgracefully, might be added, unless some <num value="1">one</num> can hereafter give some yet undiscovered reason to the contrary &mdash; and were taken at almost every possible disadvantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wild cries from the pickets rushing in, and the few scattering shots that preceded their arrival, aroused the regiments to a sense of their peril; an instant afterwards rattling volleys of musketry poured through the tents, while, before there was time for thought or preparation, there came rushing through the woods, with lines of battle sweeping the whole fronts of the division camps and bending down on either flank, the fine, dashing, compact columns of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/> Into the just aroused camps thronged the rebel regiments, firing sharp volleys as they came, and springing forward upon our laggards with the bayonet; for awhile their artillery, already in position, was loosing shells to the further side of the encampments, scores were shot down as they were running, without weapons, hatless, coatless, toward the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The searching bullets found other poor unfortunates in their tents, and there, all unheeding now, they still slumbered, while the unseen foe rushed on. Others fell as they were disentangling themselves from the flaps that form the doors to their tents; others as they were buckling on their accoutrements; others as they were vainly trying to impress on the cruelly exultant enemy their readiness to surrender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/> Officers were bayoneted in their beds and left for dead, who, through the whole <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> fearful struggle, lay there gasping in their agony, and on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> were found in their gore inside their tents, and still able to tell the tale. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Meantime the other <num value="2">two</num> brigades of the division (to the right) sprang hastily to their arms, and had barely done so when the enemy's lines came sweeping up against their fronts, too, and the battle thus opened fiercely along <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s whole line on the right. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>It is certain that parts of regiments, both here and in other divisions, ran disgracefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Yet they were not wholly without excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>They were raw troops, just from the usual idleness of our <q>&#x0022;camps of instruction;&#x0022;</q> hundreds of them had never heard a gun fired in anger; their officers, for the most part, were equally inexperienced; they had been reposing in fancied security, and were awaked, perhaps, from sweet dreams of home, and wives, and children, by the stunning roar of cannon in their very midst, and the bursting of a bombshell among their tents &mdash; to see only the serried columns of the magnificent rebel advance, and through the blinding, stiffing smoke, the hasty retreat of comrades and supports, right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Certainly, it is sad enough, but hardly surprising, that under such circumstances, some should run. Half as much caused the wild panic at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, for which the nation, as <num value="1">one</num> man, became a loud-mouthed apologist. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>We also brought away a number of wagons and horses, and some ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>But no account has yet been taken of our captures, and I forbear entering into further details until reliable data can be obtained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/> For the same reason, I shall offer no opinion as to the number of killed and wounded on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>I hope the <rs>Confederate</rs> loss is not so large as many believe it to be. I am satisfied that the number killed is not in the usual proportion to the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>This is owing, doubtless, to the protection afforded by the trees. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> <time value="6pm">6 P. M.</time>--The enemy ventured so far this afternoon as to send out a cavalry regiment a short distance in the direction of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>In the confusion that ensued among the <rs>Federals</rs>, they fired upon their own cavalry, and killed and wounded a large number of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>It is not thought to be mortal, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The entire Federal force engaged immediately fell back in evident disorder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/> It would be premature at this time to indulge in speculations upon the results of the <num value="2">two</num>- days' battle out of which we have just emerged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>I may be permitted to say, however, that the effect upon the <rs>Confederates</rs> has been to inspire them with fresh confidence and renewed determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>They have felt of the enemy, and have themselves passed through the fire, and will be the better prepared for a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> great battle which is to come off at or near <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/> I am not informed as to the extent of the reinforcements which the enemy has received, or of his ability to undertake an early forward movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>He has been badly crippled and cut up, and has lost much valuable property and many of his best field pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Moreover, the roads are in a shocking condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>It rained very hard last night, and again to-day, and there is a prospect for more rain to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>All these things will tend to delay further active operations by either party. </p> </q><bibl n="Mobile Register"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The fight was renewed this morning at <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> by the enemy, who had been reinforced during the night, and with the exception of short breathing spells, it raged with tremendous violence and fury until night separated the combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>This is necessary to a proper understanding of the battle; and until this general sketch or outline is drawn, it will be impossible to enter into those minor details which constitute an interesting feature in the picture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> Night alone prevented us from reaping the fruits of our brilliant victory of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>It was quite dark when we chased the foe back to <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg Landing</placeName>, where he sought protection from his gunboats and river works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>As it was, we expected to be able to capture so much of the <rs>Federal</rs> army this morning as could not be transferred to the other bank of the river last night, unless large reinforcements should come to their relief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> The enemy received the most important aid from his gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Indeed he is indebted to these gunboats for his escape from certain destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>They, together with his river works, answered the valuable purpose of fortifications to which he could retire when beaten on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>With only our light field pieces, it was impossible to operate at night with any hope of success against these works and boats, or to prosecute during the heavy storm that followed the work of completing the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Our forces had reached the river in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places as night came on, and in this way had gained some knowledge of the ground, and the nature and position of the enemy's defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>With this knowledge, and the enemy driven into close quarters, and caught between our lines and the river, there was every reason to believe we would be able to capture the larger part of his forces this morning, provided they were not reinforced during the night or transferred to the other bank of the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/> The boats kept up a constant fire during the night from their heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>It appears that the enemy did not seek to recross the river.
