<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But after learning the movements of the enemy, he thought best to fall back so as to prevent the enemy from cutting off his supplies and getting in his rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Hence we slowly began our retrograde movement, noticing the enemy, until on the night of the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> we rested at the foot of the mountain, some <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> west of Prestonsburg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>During the night of the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> we learned that the enemy, in large numbers; was moving towards us from the direction of Prestonsburg. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> On arriving at the <rs type="place">Cross Roads</rs>, we learned that the enemy, <num value="5000">5,000</num> or <num value="6000">6,000</num> strong, had taken his position about <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile below the <rs type="place">Cross Roads</rs>. <num value="2">Two</num> regiments and some cavalry, as a reserve, had taken their position at the foot of the hill to our front and left, while the main body of the enemy was formed into line of battle at the foot of the hill, to our front and right, awaiting our approach. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Thus posted, the <num value="2">two</num> armies for a moment, in silence gazed on each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What a contrast they presented!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The enemy looked grand and imposing, completely equipped and neatly dressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our line was small, and seemingly of little firmness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>when compared with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Badly equipped and uniformed, and well nigh exhausted by long and heavy marches through the mud and rain, living on less than half rations for the last few weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But we feared them not, and were anxious to try them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> But the time to view the enemy was of short duration, for soon the boom of our artillery announced to us that the battle had began, and then the hissing of the ball and cracking of the brush over our heads told us that the hottest of the conflict would fall on <orgName type="regiment" key="29VARegiment"><persName n="Moore,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Moore,A.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>'s 29th Virginia Regiment</orgName>; but our boys were calm and ready. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> For <num value="2">two</num> long hours the enemy poured upon <persName n="Moore,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Moore,A.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Cols.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName> and <persName n="Williams,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel"></roleName><surname>Williams</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="regiments">regiments</orgName> a perfect storm of hall, which our boys received with coldness, and responded to with such terrible fires that the enemy began to stagger from the effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Just at this point, <persName n="Moore,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Moore,A.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName> ordered his regiment to charge, leading it in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>With such firmness was the charge made that the enemy broke at our approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But just as the foe was dislodged from his position, we were cross-fired from the right and left with deadly effect, supposed partly to have been done by our own men through mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At the same time some <num value="1">one</num>, no <num value="1">one</num> knows who, gave the command to fall back to our old position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Thus, in an instant, we lost all we had gained in <num value="2">two</num> long hours of hard fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In the charge we lost <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> of our brave boys. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> On reaching the blow of the hill, we gave a shout for <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, resolving to have the field or die. Again we opened fires with double energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Now the battle raged along the whole brow of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><persName n="Williams,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> fought like a tiger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Twice the enemy tried to flank him; twice they were repulsed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The cavalry having dismounted, poured a dreadful and destructive fire into the right flank of the insolent foe. The artillery was likewise placed to a better position, throwing shot and shell with fatal effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Trigg,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Trigg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Trigg</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> was called forward to reinforce <persName n="Moore,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Moore,A.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>; but, before they could reach their position, a victory was proclaimed in favor of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The enemy's guns were silenced, and, as soon as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> could get off the field, we were left its possessors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Had not night been on us the rout would have been made complete; but the day was gone, we tired and hungry, <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> from our camp</placeName>, thought best to gather up our dead and wounded and seek rest for our bodies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Much might be said of individual acts of bravery; but time will not permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>All did their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Most of our troops had never before seen a battle field; yet they fought with the courage and boldness which characterizes the people which they represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>With a united effort they completely whipped a foe numerically <num value="5">five</num> times stronger than themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> <persName n="Moore,Colonel,A.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Moore,A.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>'s <orgName type="regiment" key="29VARegiment">29th Va. regiment</orgName> bore the heat of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Our <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>, <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Moore,A.,C.,,"><surname>Moore</surname></persName> and <persName n="Leigh,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Leigh,nomatch:0"><surname>Leigh</surname></persName>, were constantly at the head of their column, cheering their men and directing their fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The gloomiest part of the day was after the enemy had left the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The shrieks of the wounded and dying were truly heart-rending. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> On the subject of winter campaigning, we find the following remarks in a late letter of <q>&#x0022;D.,&#x0022;</q> the correspondent of the <orgName n="New Orleans Delta" type="newspaper">N. O. <hi rend="italics">Delta</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>They are intended to illustrate the movements of <orgName n="column"><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s column</orgName>: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> These operations show that there is still room to anticipate active campaigning on the <rs>Virginia</rs> frontier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is true that the campaign along the lower Potomac may be considered virtually closed for the season, both armies having retired into winter quarters; but it is likewise true that an active, energetic commander, not restrained by the dictates of a fixed policy, may yet find means and opportunities of carrying on the war in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>If troops can be moved in the mountains of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Central</rs> Virginia</placeName>; if forced marches can be made, battles fought, and victories won, in that inhospitable region, remote from magazines and depots, we may well inquire why it is taken for granted that operations are impracticable in the accessible country along the lower Potomac, and that the milder climate of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> is yet severe enough to paralyze all movement on the part of the <num value="2">two</num> armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>And in a case where the honor of an old nation is engaged on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and the pride of a growing and ambitious people on the other, the member for <persName n="Bradford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Bradford,nomatch:0"><surname>Bradford</surname></persName> is cautious and deliberate in seeking to elucidate the facts of an international question, to determine the principles which should govern its adjustment without sacrifice of honor on either side, and, without insisting off hand and dogmatically on the resort to arbitration before he has ascertained whether the opportunity for arbitration has arrived, he urges that the possibility and propriety of appealing to some better decision than that of the sword should be kept in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>This, in truth, is all that can be advanced with any show of reason or prudence at the present moment in favor of a principle which may not, after all, whether fortunately or unfortunately, be susceptible of application to the present case. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> It is not in these columns that our readers will-look for a word against a principle to which we cleave as a pledge of a happier future for the Old World and the <rs>New</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> It is in this spirit that we earnestly condemn the policy of dividing <name>English</name> opinion on the previous question of national honor, or representing it as divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Our Government has addressed a demand to the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as moderate and conciliatory in form as it is decided in substance; and having done this, it has a right to count for something on the strength and imposing appearance of strength which comes of national union even more than of vast material resources, in supreme emergencies, when the hand is on the sword hilt, but the heart is still for peace. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> A review of the past history of this war brings out <num value="1">one</num> feature in bold relief; which is, that the people have at no moment been wanting in the duty demanded of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>There are those who feel some apprehension of trouble on the subject of enlisting a sufficient army to take the place of the men of <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> who will go out of service next <rs type="season">spring</rs>, <rs type="season">summer</rs>, and <rs type="season">fall</rs>; but our own fears on this account are removed by a recollection of the alacrity which has characterized the people in meeting every emergency that has arisen in the course of the war. Even at this moment there are many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of troops, enlisted for the war, seeking admission into the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, who cannot yet be accepted on account of the deficiency of arms; and we believe that with proper effort, the fact will continue to be as it heretofore has been at every moment of the war, that more troops offer than there are arms to place in their hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> The capacity of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> in arms we believe to be from <num value="200">two hundred</num> to <num value="250000">two hundred and fifty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>This is a full large enough force to keep in the field, and we do not fear but that enough, troops will always be seeking admission into the service to give employment to this number of arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> The enemy have committed a great mistake in bringing so large an army into the field as anything like their boasted <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It is too large a force to be employed to the best advantage; and while producing an enormous drain upon their Treasury, supplies wholesale food for death and camp disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>They will break down their Treasury and frighten their people by heavy taxation out of all taste for the war, long before they can bring their vast and cumbrous machinery for invasion into play, and long before they can succeed in subjugating the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> The blunder they are committing is apparent, and they have gone too far in it to retrieve it, although they have now plainly discovered the error they have committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We must not copy their fatal mistake by bringing a too large and an utterly unwieldily force into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Our policy is to employ a smaller force, and to husband our men, supplies, and finances, in proportion as they lavish and waste theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Those of our Southern people take a very mistaken view of the war who think our cause is ruined if we fail to meet the vast hordes of the enemy with proportionate forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>A mighty army of our own, disproportion to the resources of our country, would do us infinitely more damage than a like army of the enemy invading our soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The invader may lay waste particular districts of our territory; but the support of his army would at last fail wholly on his own treasury; while the loss we would sustain would not be a <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> part of the cost of a vast opposing force placed by ourselves in the field to confront his own. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>I believe that the <num value="2">two</num> contiguous estates, embracing these salines, and the lease under which they are now operated, can be procured for <num value="1000000">one million</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>I have some acquaintance with this property, and am persuaded that the purchase ought to be made at that price, if it can be done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> The property is worth more than is demanded for it. It is in danger of passing into the hands of a joint stock company at a higher price than the <rs>State</rs> would be required to give, viz: at <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure>; to the capital of which company upwards of <measure n="300000dollars" type="currency">three hundred thousand dollars</measure> is already subscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Corporations have no souls, and if the works pass into a corporate ownership, they pass into the hands of a monopoly, having the single object alone of making the largest profits out of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> The property is proved to be worth more than is demanded of the <rs>State</rs>; not only by the fact that it will bring more, but by the fact that the <rs>State</rs> officers have been assessing it for <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> past; (I mean the property itself, irrespectively of the lease,) at about half a <num value="1000000">million</num> for the <rs>Preston</rs> and over half a <num value="1000000">million</num> for the <rs>King</rs> estate; more than a <num value="1000000">million</num> for the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The State could sell it anywhere within her limits; except in seaport cities, at <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> a bushel with transportation added; or at a profit of <num value="30">thirty</num> to <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure> per bushel.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> The State ought to own this property, for the reason that salt and plaster are articles that should be in the hands of public agents rather than of private monopolies, and for the further reason that the transportation of these articles can always be secured on the most economical terms by the <rs>State</rs>; whereas this transportation is so tardy and costly when on private account as to give opportunity for the enormous speculations in these essential articles, such as we have just witnessed, in times of scarcity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> The propriety and necessity of the purchase of this salt and plaster property, on the cheap and liberal terms on which they are now offered the <rs>State</rs>, seems so obvious as to need no argument; and I trust that there is enough sagacity in the <name>Legislature</name> to give effect to the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The suggestion that I would make is that, now that arrangements are being made to suit the times, as regards the laws of the militia, that some definite provision should be made for certain classes of men to be found in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Such men are now forced to perform militia duties at home, and, therefore, should a call on the militia be made, would be taken from their families, depriving them of all protection, and having to occupy the same position as men who have furnished no substitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>And, again, there are men in my section of the country, some professing delicate constitutions, and others having families living on farms with a large number of slaves, who have substituted in volunteer companies from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="7">seven</num> acting in the place of <num value="1">one</num> man &mdash; some from <num value="16">16</num> to <num value="18">18</num>, and others over <measure n="45years" type="date">45 years</measure> of age. These men have been acknowledged as substitutes by the company and its commandant, each <num value="1">one</num> of them being better able to discharge the duties of a soldier than he who has furnished them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The end desired has never and can never be attained by any such method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>In a State where the consumption of the great staples now so much in demand is much larger than the production, and where the deficit has to be made up by importation, it seems a foolish and vain act of legislation to impose restriction upon exports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>It apparently was a surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>I cannot comprehend how a boat's crew could land and fire upon a <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket-guard</orgName> before being detected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>It is said that some of the pickets were asleep; certainly the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had sufficient time to aim with deliberation, as <num value="7">seven</num> balls were found in a small sapling contiguous to the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>The practice of allowing a fire to the picket on exposed positions is reprehensible, as it discloses to the enemy the very fact of our guard, and in many instances enables him to evade the vigilance of the sentry, if he has not yielded to the influence of the fire. </p>
