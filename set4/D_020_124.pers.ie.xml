<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Great Public Trouble</hi> has the effect of developing in their most gigantic force and activity, the noblest instinets and the most evil passions of the human heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is well known that in seasons of plagues and pestilence, when there seems less than a plank between every man and the great ocean of eternity, whilst humanity, generosity, heroism, and piety are stimulated to new energy in the good, selfishness, avarice, cowardice, crime, and infidelity also display themselves in their most frightful and audacious forms.--Whilst the good <rs>Samaritans</rs> are seeking to relieve the sick or assuage the agonies of the dying in <num value="1">one</num> house, the thief and robber are ransacking the deserted tenement next door; whilst the voice of profound penitence and prayer arises from <num value="1">one</num> hearthstone, curses so fierce arise from another that the might think that the impatient fiends had come from hell to claim their prey; whilst the funeral procession is going along the street, it passes by dwellings where revelry is roaring out its wildest strains, or debauchery holding its foulest orgies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><q>&#x0022;The same eat which hardens the clay, softens the wax; the same light which gladdens a sound eye torments a diseased; the same pillar of a cloud which was a cloud and darkness to the <name>Egyptains</name>, gave light to the <name>Israelites</name>.&#x0022;</q> The different qualities of men, whether good or evil, when called into action by the alilicting dispensations of the <rs>Almighty</rs>'s hand, prove that the <name>Scriptures</name> declare the same thing when they say that <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> is love,&#x0022;</q> and that <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> is a consuming fire.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> It is with war as with pestilence and other great calamities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>All that is great and good in human nature has been developed in the hearts of the <rs>Southern</rs> people by the murderous assault of the despotism at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> upon their hearths and homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Their very enemies had conceded to them the qualities of generosity, hospitality, and courage, but their best friends never knew before the boundlessness of their devotion to principle, the immeasurable and inexhaustible depths of their spirit of self-sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We need not speak of the splendid heroism exhibited on every battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Nobler, purer, and even more heroic is the patriotism of the <rs>Southern</rs> women who have given to their country the idols of their hearts, offering them up with the deep devotion and unquestioning trust of the patriarch when, at the command of Heaven, he surrendered his son to the sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>In every Southern home there has been the faith of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>, and not content with this, they have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and ministered to the sick, binding around the sacrifice of patriarchal faith the garlands of the brightest <name>Christian</name> virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Did ever the world see such nobility of nature as the <rs>Southern</rs> people have manifested in this war, and do not such a people deserve to be free? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> But, amidst this vast and wonderful exhibition of abnegation, unselfishness, and heroism, there have been developments, in exceptional cases, of some of the meanest, most self-seeking, most sordid and callous features of the human heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Amidst the storm which has roused the faithful mariner to mount the shrouds and expose his life for the safety of the laboring vessel, greedy vermin have been scampering undisturbed between decks, and availing themselves of the general confusion to satiate their hungry naws without interruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The lust of office and of gain has run not amid the agitation of the political elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The very soldiers of the army who, without hope of pay or of official distinction, have fought the battles of the country and endured the most terrible privations and hardships, have been victimized by heartless speculators, who pursue them with extortions to their very graves, and, but for the laws of the land, would unearth them rom their last resting place and manufacture their bones into articles of merchandize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But these vulgar and ferocious beasts of prey are in no degree more inhuman and ravenous than the more polished and hypocritical aspirants for posts of distinction and emolument who think only, amid the general distress how they may best advance their individual fortunes and fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The man who, at such a time as this, thinks of himself beyond what absolute duty to himself and those dependent upon him requires, is not fit to be trusted, and, instead of being gratified in his aspirations for leadership, ought to bring up the rear in the great army of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The proper place for such men is among the camp-followers, and, even in that position, they ought to be closely watched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In the piping times of peace self-seeking politicians may be tolerated, but when the ship is on the breakers, to find them still incapable amid the general peril of any thought but of their own aggrandizement, is a display of selfishness so revolting, that every honest hand must instinctively grasp for a lash to scourge through the world the sordid crew who would convert this last temple of freedom into a den of thieves. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>As he professes to be a gentleman as well as soldier, we do not envy his feelings on visiting with fire and sword a community which has thus contributed to his happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We are astonished that he could accept the command of an expedition destined to lay waste the homes where he has been a welcome guest, and to make widows and orphans of the women and children who, through the <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> of his residence among them, made him forget that he was a stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>If he be the high-minded and chivalric man he is represented, he would have indignantly thrown his commission in the face of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> before he would have gone forth on such an errand. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> In another proclamation, he invites the people to return to their homes and resume their usual occupations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The people of the invaded districts will probably reply to him that they have no homes, that when a tyrant takesaway the country, he takes away the hearthstone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We only regret that the people of <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> were not permitted to burn down their town, as they desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>If the enemy is to understand that we are in earnest, we must make the land a desert before him. The only result of any other policy is to give him aid and comfort in his villainies.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Lying in a small valley which stretches to the <rs>Potomac</rs> and nearly surounded by a range of hills, is what remains of the old colonial town of <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, the point from which your correspondent is now writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Entering on the <placeName reg="Brentsville, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,2110773">Brentsville</placeName> road, <num value="1">one</num> passes over a sandy and rolling tract of country, and comes to a terrace, if <num value="1">one</num> may so call the ridge that rises abruptly from the valley, which completely overlooks the town, and gives a good panoramic view of the stream upon which it is situated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Stretching out in a southerly direction, widening gradually in its course is Quantico <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, and beyond it the <rs>Potomac</rs>, a silver-like thread of water, just visible between the headlands at the mouth of the bay. Still farther on, the shore of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is visible, dotted here and there with farm-houses and patches of woodland, its line of hills forming the distant horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The land around <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> is generally poor, and covered with a dense growth of young pines, or with forests of stinted oak, showing it has at sometime in its history been cleared land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Coming in from the <rs>North</rs>, winding between the hills and dashing over the rocks in hundreds of ministure cascades, the <name>Quantico</name> enters the town, and passes out of it through a marsh, or meadow, half a mile in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>From this point it grows wider and deeper, until it runs into the <rs>Potomac</rs> at <placeName reg="Evansport, Defiance, Ohio" key="tgn,2079480">Evansport</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> The town itself is built upon a side hill, which slopes gradually to the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Coming into it, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> house visible is upon an eminence called <q>&#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,2629050" n="1.000 3" reg="rose hill, johnson, missouri">Rose Hill</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> from which a splendid view is obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It is an old house that has been for some time deserted, a legend hanging about it of a poor suicide, who blew his brains out within its wills, and whose ghost still lingers around the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Every old town has its haunted spot &mdash; the point of interest to strangers and its bugbear for children &mdash; and <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> is no exception to the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Unfortunately, the army was in need of boards, and this house has been stripped completely, and now little but the framework remains to hold the dead man's spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It was near sunset when I rode up the hill, and standing beside the haunted building got an idea of the scenery which I am trying to express in words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The evening wind sighed through the bare ratters like the moaning of some restless spirit, and a night own flew out of a broken window and flitted into the dark shadow of some neighboring pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Built by a man of wealth and influence, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> &#x0022;The house remained awhile, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> Silent and tenantless &mdash; then went to strangers&#x0022; --Since then it has passed through years of neglect, and has now gone to ruin and decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>To those who are fond of relies of the past the spot was of interest, and <num value="1">one</num> could imagine more old wives' tales hanging about it than pine cones in the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Standing beside it, many a delicious memory floats through the mind like the dream of some long-forgotten melody, and the brain is filled with weird and mystical recollections of long ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> About a <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">thousand yards</measure> below <q>&#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,2629050" n="1.000 3" reg="rose hill, johnson, missouri">Rose Hill</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> the village commences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>A single street bordered on either side by houses in every stage of dilapitation &mdash; half ruined stores and toppling barns, that only maintain their equilibrium by the aid of sundry rails propped against them; solitary chimneys standing up like <q>&#x0022;sacred to the memory;&#x0022;</q> broken stone fences; half a dozen substantial brick buildings that have been elegant in their day; <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> wooden ones almost in ruins, a number of sheds whose roofs have fallen in are about all the village can boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>There is scarcely a house entirely covered with weatherboarding or shingles; the <unclear>s sh</unclear> is broken, and in the place of glass a bundle of rags or old clothes stores <num value="1">one</num> in the face at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But few of the former residents remain in their houses, nearly all of them being occupied by sutlers or some kind of tradesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Love's hotel, a <num value="2">two</num> story brick building with a basement, is the largest house in the place, and decidedly the most modern of all &mdash; in it are <placeName><persName n="Wigfall,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Wigfall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wigfall</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, the officers of his staff, and the departments of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>In an upstairs, corner room, is the <orgName n="Telegraph Office" type="office">telegraph office</orgName>, where the click, click, click of the busy instruments can be heard from morning until night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>At the opposite end of the town is the court-house, or what was the court-house before the county site was removed to <placeName key="tgn,2110773" n="1.000 8" reg="brentsville, prince william, virginia">Brentsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It is a structure of peculiar architecture, built of imported brick, with granite corner-stones and cornices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The floor is formed of quadrangular flag stones nicely fitted together, most of them worn away by the shuffling of many feet, and the benches and the bar, constructed of heavy oak, have grown rotten and worthless with age. Near by this is the old <placeName reg="Colonial Court, Montgomery, Tennessee" key="tgn,2250427">Colonial court</placeName>-house, a small <num value="1">one</num> story cottage, now occupied as a residence by the only person born in town now living in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> The date of this house I cannot ascertain; no <num value="1">one</num> here remembers to have heard but I presume the town records will tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>That it is old enough, there are sufficient indications &mdash; the weather-boards have grown thin under the storms of many winters, and its sides and roof are covered with moss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <measure n="3yards" type="distance">three yards</measure> from the house is the old jail, a small building made of heavy oak timber, still well preserved, with <num value="1">one</num> window and a strong double-door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The original bolts and hinges and grating across the single window still remain as evidences of its an iquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Near by this is a brick mansion now used as a hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>It is owned by a man from <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> who has been some <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, an ignorant and not very brilliant individual, who spends his time in general loafing and in swearing at <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Hearing me making inquiries about the town he came forward and offered his service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Taking us around the house he pointed to a base-stone supporting <num value="1">one</num> of the pillars of the porch-- </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> We laughed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> Smiling at the absurdity, we copied the inscription and bid our guide adieu. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> Several of the buildings in the village have been taken for hospitals, and all that are suitable, I believe, have been put to that use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Whether either of them believed what they said is altogether immaterial; but from the proceeding of certain <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> traffickers who are already sting vessels with <orgName n="Yankee Notions" type="newspaper">Yankee notions</orgName> to be sent it <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> and exclanged for cotton, it is probable they were in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>We arrive at the same conclusion from another point of departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have hever been dispossessed of the belief that the old Union has innumerable friends, even in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and that they only want the presence of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army to avow themselves openly &mdash; From these, probably, <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="nearbymention:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><surname>Adams</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> expect to derive cotton enough to supply the demand in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Had they not some such expectation, we see not how they could expect to realise their promise by merely capturing the cotton ports, even if they should take every <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>They know as well as we that the cotton is dispersed over several <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> plantations, that it is not even <unclear>g ned</unclear> that the greater part of it is, the fact, still in the boil, How, then, could they get it by merely capturing the ports, to which it is usually brought for sale and exportation, unless they hoped that avarice would promp the planters to betray their country, and bring it to them for money?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>In the opinion of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, money can induce men to do anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>So it can, if they happen to be <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But though the late monopolies and extortions convince us that there are Southern born <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> among us, still the proportion is comtemptibly small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>At least among the cotton planters there are none who dare play the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, so far as to furnish them with cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/> I need hardly, perhaps, tell you of the position in which we are how with regard to cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>What is to become of us unless we can get that <num value="0.85">eighty-five per cent</num>, very greatly made up somewhere else?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Unless something occurs to settle this silly, foolish mischievous, and, I think, very wicked quarrel, I can see no prospect of the working classes in the cotton trade being kept <num value="0.5">one-half</num> or <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>It is a fearful thing to contemplate. * * * You see the temper in which the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war is carried on, and the state of feeling, and you can judge as well as I can of the probabilities of the cessation of this miserable quarrelling amongst themselves.
