<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> When the <rs>North</rs> commenced its insane crusade for the <rs>Union</rs>, it scarcely expected that <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of the crusade would simply end in the subversion of its own liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>But it has been justly observed that there is nothing new in the moral world under the sun, because the changing theatre of human events exhibits, in different ages, under every different combination of human affairs, the certain operation of the same passions, desires and vices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The <rs>North</rs> is indifferently acquainted with the history of its own <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> forefathers in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, or it has studied that history to little purpose, if it does not discover that it has only been treading over again the old and beaten path by which Liberty ends in Despotism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> When the <rs>English</rs> nation, in <dateStruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></dateStruct>, raised the standard of revolt against <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="1">I</genName></persName>., their brains ran made with visions of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They as little anticipated the actual result as did the <rs>North</rs> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They did not expect that taxation was to be quadrupled, personal freedom destroyed, government carried on solely by the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major generals</rs> of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, and themselves made the victims of the most crushing military oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>When they took up arms in order to wrest the command of the militia from <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>, they did not dream that within <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> they would have to pay a greater sum, in war-contributions and taxes, than had been raised in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in all the centuries put together since the <name>Norman</name> conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>If the <rs>North</rs> wishes to know all that is in store for it, as the fruits of its own politico-religious enthusiasm of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, it has only to consult <persName n="Hume,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Hume,nomatch:0"><surname>Hume</surname></persName> <num value="7">7</num>, <num value="241">241</num>: &#x0022;To raise the new imposition called the decimation, the <rs>Protector</rs> instituted <num value="12">twelve</num> <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major generals</rs>, and divided the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> into so many military jurisdictions.--These men, assisted by commissioners, had power to subject whom they pleased to decimation, to levy all the taxes imposed by the <rs>Protector</rs> and his council, and to imprison any person who should be exposed to their jealousy or suspicion; nor was there any appeal from them but to the <rs>Protector</rs> himself and his council.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Under color of these powers, which were sufficiently exorbitant, the major-generals exercised a power still more exorbitant, and acted as if absolute masters of the property and persons of every subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>All reasonable men now concluded that the very mask of liberty was at length thrown aside, and that the nation was forever subject to military and despotic government &mdash; exercised, not in the legal <unclear></unclear> <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations, but according to the maxims of Eastern <unclear></unclear> Before <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> term has expired, the <rs>North</rs> will ascertain that in this, as in other chapters of its experiences, there is nothing new under the sun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> When <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, flung forth the banner of democratic freedom, how little did it anticipate that the only results of their passionate political enthusiasm was to be the extinguishment of every vestige of freedom under the colossal throne of a military despot ! They expected the enfranchisement of the human race, and they only proved that the depravity of the human heart is made more manifest, deplorable and ruinous of government by increasing the number and destroying the responsibility of those who govern a country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> And this is the universal testimony of all ancient and modern history. &#x0022;Democracy,&#x0022; said <persName><foreName>Pius</foreName> <genName n="6">VI</genName></persName>., &#x0022;is not contrary to the <name>Gospel</name> of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>; only it requires those sublime virtues which are alone to be found in the <name>Gospel</name>.&#x0022;--The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is running the career, and approaching the end, of all similar governments, and for the same reason. &#x0022;The necessity,&#x0022; says <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>, &#x0022;for external government to man is in the inverse ratio of the vigor of his self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>What virtue in map anywhere, except that which proceeds from the regenerating influence of Christianity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Hence the universal failure of such governments as that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <persName n="Tocqueville,,M.,,,de" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="expanded:Tocqueville,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName>, in his impartial and philosophical survey of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> equality, long ago portrayed seeds in the undisguised &#x0022;tyranny of the majority&#x0022; of the eventual destruction of civil liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> There is nothing new under the sun. The forms of free government alone remain in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; but it is substantially a military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It has gone the way of all like experiments of the &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">vox populi vox dei.&#x0022;</hi> But it might have finished with dignity, instead of selecting as its first master a man whom <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> or <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName> would only have employed as a sutler. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>There is no room for debate &mdash; there is no time for discussing collateral issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>There is time for nothing but resistance &mdash; bloody and determined resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Every man in Congress has pledged himself to this; every State in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has pledged its means, and all its force, in like manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>There is a clear plighting of the national faith of every State, and the lives, fortunes and sacred honor of every Southern man, to the common cause of the independence of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> &mdash; each for the other, and each for all. That these sacred pledges will be most faithfully, loyally and manfully maintained, none should, for a moment, doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>That is all that is necessary to ensure us the triumph &mdash; to secure us peace and independence &mdash; to liberate us, finally, from political affiliation and association with the most unprincipled people on earth. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
