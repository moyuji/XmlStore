<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Immediately, from every direction, were seen soldiers hurrying to and fro. In a few minutes more the different regiments might be seen marching in different directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The news was, that the enemy had beaten the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> at <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName>, and were crossing the bridge there in large numbers.
