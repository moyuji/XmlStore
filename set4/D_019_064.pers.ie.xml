<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The question before the country, he proceeded to say, presented itself in a social and in a commercial view, and as he represented in part the chief commercial city of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, he proposed to address himself mainly to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>With regard to the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions he differed entirely with the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>,(<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Summers,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Summers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Summers</surname></persName>.</hi>) A basis of adjustment ought to settle forever the agitation of the slavery question, which this failed to do. All agreed that the <rs>State</rs> was no longer safe under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of our fathers, and only differed on the amendments proposed to be incorporated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It was sufficient to render a change necessary, to know that the forms of the <rs>Constitution</rs> were observed in the election on the <date value="6">6th</date> of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, which has resulted in the inauguration of a party avowedly hostile to our interests, and permitted that party to seize all the power of Government, and to wield it to our oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The Constitution that we require must be a shield to protect us, not only in the territories, forts, dock-yards, &#x0026;c., but must give us equality in all the purposes of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="1Section">first section</orgName> of the <rs>Peace Propositions</rs> conceded to the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party all that they had ever asked for. The very language used, which the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName> relied upon to protect our property, was that used by <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Judges and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to show that there was no property in slaves; because the word <q>&#x0022;persons&#x0022;</q> is used, and there cannot, as they contend, be property in persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>He quoted from the language of <persName n="Fessenden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Fessenden,nomatch:0"><surname>Fessenden</surname></persName> and <persName n="Collamer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Collamer,nomatch:0"><surname>Collamer</surname></persName> in the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The latter clearly meant <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery, while in the former, the apprentice system might be regarded as equally plain.-- He contended that such <q>&#x0022;protection&#x0022;</q> amounted to nothing, and made an able argument in connection therewith. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> He asked by what standard the <q>&#x0022;status&#x0022;</q> would be tried; whether by the law as it now exists, or by laws hereafter to be enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, he maintained, recognized no status of slavery in any Territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This was apparent from all their platforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The anti-slavery dogma was the creed of the party, and they had manifested a determination to abrogate the slave code of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>, which the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName> had so much relied upon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> The <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">second section</orgName>, he said, had been most elaborately defended, and proceeded to reply to the arguments advanced by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Summers,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Summers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Summers</surname></persName></hi> on the partition of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The question was proposed to be transferred to the floor of the <name>Senate</name>, and whichever party holding the majority should so manage as to seduce a few votes to their side, would seize upon the whole of the territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He contended that it furnished no guarantee to the <rs>South</rs>, while it would eventually bring in all the provinces of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> against us. The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> had all the power of patronage on their side, while we had nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The provision gives rise to corruption and compromise, and consequently a constant agitation of the slavery question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> In the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName>, on the question of taxation and representation, he found fresh grounds for agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="4Section">fourth section</orgName> he passed by. The <orgName type="regiment" key="5Section">fifth section</orgName>, instead of prohibiting the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade, prohibited the <hi rend="italics">foreign</hi> slave trade, thus ffectually cutting off the trade between <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>We were thus hermetically sealed; and by their homestead legislation, the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> hold out inducements to our citizens to emigrate, and it would tend eventually to <persName n="Virginia,,Africanise,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="default:Virginia,Africanise,,,"><foreName>Africanise</foreName> <surname>Virginia</surname></persName>, for they could not take their slave property with them to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>With regard to the <orgName type="regiment" key="7Section">seventh section</orgName>, he asked why it was, when professing to make the <rs>General Government</rs> pay for fugitive slaves, they dropped the language used by <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He drew a comparison between the parallel sections of the <num value="2">two</num> propositions, showing that the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> only proposed compensation for slaves when they were rescued from their owners by a mob or riotous assemblage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He conceived that it this provision were excised, as proposed by the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>, it would cut <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> off the leading motive of the <rs>North</rs> for adopting it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> The speaker then proceeded to consider the question in its commercial aspect; whether the interest of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be best promoted by continuing with the <rs>North</rs>, or by uniting her industry with the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The question had found a solution in the adoption of a tariff by the <rs>Provisional Government</rs> of the <rs>Confederated States</rs>, and the indicated purpose to adopt a tariff for revenue in the permanent Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Alluding to the position of the gentleman from <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086267">Bedford</placeName>, (<persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName>,) he proposed to show that the agricultural interests of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be better protected under a free trade with the <rs>South</rs> than under a free trade with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>In this connection he produced tables of statistics on the productions of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, to show that the market for them was not at the <rs>North</rs>, where there was a surplus, but at the <rs>South</rs> or in foreign ports, where the deficiency was. If we went North they would say, we don't want your productions-- we have more than you have; but if we went South, they would take what we sent them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>He further argued that productions commanded higher prices under a tariff merely for revenue, than under a high tariff for protection. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It only required a little time, a little patience, and a little forbearance, and a consultation with our sister slave States not out of the <rs>Union</rs>, to bring about a satisfactory adjustment of the existing difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>But aside from national questions, he thought it would be wise in the <rs>Convention</rs> also, to remove the causes of difficulty and strife at home; to remove the odious distinctions and unequal burthens now imposed upon citizens of the <rs>State</rs>; to compose domestic strife, and produce harmony throughout the length and breadth of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/><num value="1">One</num> cause of complaint was the anomaly in our organic law, by which a large portion of the property of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> was wholly exempt from taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>I am not surprised that strangers should be thus unfavorably impressed; for it is a peculiarity of this people that they are not social on <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acquaintance without a strong endorsement, but as a better acquaintance opens, you will see that a generous and kindly feeling begins to manifest itself, which ultimately grows into firm friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>There is running through the whole family of the native <rs>Charlestonians</rs> a very decided resemblance in form, feature, manner, carriage, and speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>They have some provincialisms, which, to <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, sound badly, such as &#x0022;steers,&#x0022; for stairs, &#x0022;repeer,&#x0022; for repair, &#x0026;c.; but as a general thing, their pronunciation is very correct, and I think elegant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>The leading <hi rend="italics">physical</hi> trait of a genuine Charlestonian is a slender and delicate frame, generally dark eyes and expression, (this you will be struck with in extreme old age of both sexes,) hair disposed to be reddish or extreme black, always quick in their motion, and unusually active, with great capacity for enduring fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>No people on the globe, that I have ever seen, can boast of as pretty feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>I can tell a thoroughbred Charlestonian the moment I see him by his foot, and I can readily detect it if a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> or Dutchman have crossed the stock; for it takes all of live generations of intermarriage to get the foot right again. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/> Politeness, real genuine politeness, grows here spontaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>A gentleman comes into my counting-room to ask a question or to collect a bill, he takes off his hat and makes known his business with the polite air that <num value="1">one</num> might expect from him in the parlor.-- This excellent trait leads every <num value="1">one</num> to respect the feelings of others; nor is the servant permitted to be more polite and condescending to the gentleman than the gentleman to the servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>But the crowning glory of the <rs>Charleston</rs> character, is benevolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>There is more ample provision made here for the poor and the orphan, the sick and the wayward even, than any city of its population that I know of. There is an asylum for the poor, another for the respectable poor, an asylum for the vicious, another for sailors, another for the sick generally, another for diseases contagious, and several others that I cannot remember, all large, airy, costly, and, I may say, magnificent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>The free schools, conducted mostly by Southern teachers, large, fine, airy and convenient houses, provided with every comfort at an immense expense, where the rich and the poor mix, and where, it may be expected, foundations will be laid for future greatness. </p>
