<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> Answer &mdash; The <hi rend="italics">Outlaying <persName n="Picquet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Picquet,nomatch:0"><surname>Picquet</surname></persName>, his Patrols</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Detached Parties,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Reserve for the <name>Picquets</name></hi>--in all, <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num>.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Q.--What is an outlaying picquet, and its object? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> A.--An outlaying picquet is a certain number of men, under the command of a captain or subaltern, detached to the front of the main body of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Its principal duties are to secure the safety and repose of the camp or cantonments by occupying such ground, and commanding such roads, that no part of the enemy's force can approach without being seen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> Q.--What is the reserve? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> A.--It is a body of troops of such force, and so places, as to support and assist the picquets on their being attacked, or that the picquets can retire on if found necessary; and to impede the advance of the enemy, so as to enable the main body to get under arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Q.--What is a patrol? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> A.--As relating to an outlaying picquet it is composed of a small body of men, under command of a subaltern or non-commissioned officer, to be sent to the front and flanks of the picquet, for the purpose of gaining information in regard to the movements and position of the enemy that may be in their vicinity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Q.--On being ordered to take charge of an outlaying picquet with a view of covering any part of the camp or cantonment, what would be your <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> A.--To make a nominal list of the non-commissioned officers and men of the picquet, and inspect their arms, ammunition, and rations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> Q.--How would you move the picquet to the ground you are ordered to occupy? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> A.--I should move as an advance guard to avoid being surprised, with advance, flank, and connecting files. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> Q.--On moving to the ground you are to occupy, what observation would you make? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> A.--I should take particular notice of all roads on my flanks, and such positions that, should I be driven in, I could defend. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> Q.--What is your <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Duty</hi>&#x0022;</q> on arriving on the ground you are to occupy? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> A.--The ground having been pointed out to me by a superior officer, where my right and left flanks are to rest, I immediately guard against surprise by placing sentries in such situations that no enemy can approach my picquet without being seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Besides which the advance files of my picquet will feel their way, and ascertain if any immediate attack is probable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> Q.--What is the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> duty after taking the foregoing precaution? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> A.--To communicate with the officers of the picquets on my right and left flanks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> Q.--How do you communicate? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> A.--I take as many men as I think will be requisite to keep up a chain of sentries from my picquet to the picquet that I am going to communicate with, posting double sentries as I pass along and keeping them on view; and having communicated with the officer on my flank, or non-commissioned officer in charge of the flank parties, I return to my picquet, reducing or increasing the sentries as I find requisite, and placing them in the most advantageous positions to overlook the approaches to my picquet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>My <rs type="role" reg="junior-Officer">junior officer</rs> or sergeant having done the same on the other flank, I then, by visiting myself, personally, ascertain that they have posted the sentries according to orders, and communicate with the officer on my other flank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> Q.--When do you conceive that your sentries are posted as they ought to be? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> A.--When they completely command every approach to the picquet, and can see the sentries on their right and left, and are as much concealed as possible from the enemy's view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> Q.--Should the picquet be a flank picquet, what precautions would you take for its security? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> A.--I should, after taking care of my <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi> security, send out patrols, under an officer or non-commissioned officer, to the <hi rend="italics">unprotected flank,</hi> which I should do every half hour, day and night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> Q.--Into how many reliefs do you divide your picquets?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>And how often do you relieve your sentries? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> A.--Into <num value="3">three</num> reliefs of double sentries, and relieve them every hour, taking care to have sufficient men to patrol. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> Q.--After your communications are established with the picquets on your flanks, and your own security from surprise ensured, what do you do? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> A.--With a patrol I make myself thoroughly acquainted with the approaches and environs of my post; and <hi rend="italics">if ordered to defend it,</hi> do my best to strengthen it, by throwing no obstacles, making loop holes should my picquet occupy a house, and in the neighboring walls; throwing up breastworks, if I have tools, and making my defence so as to have as many cross fires as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> Q.--Are the sentries on an out laying picquet posted double? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> A.--Yes, and a communicating (single) sentry from them to the body of the picquet, to convey any signal or order that might come from the front. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> Q.--How do you place your sentries at night? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> A.--I generally move them from the place they occupied during the day, particularly should they have been seen by the enemy, and if they have been on a height, I move them to lower ground, in order that they may discern any object on the sky-line with greater case than looking down they would be able to do, and place them in the most advantageous positions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> Q.--Would you increase the number of sentries at night? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> A.--As a rule, yes, with the view of preventing the possibility of the enemy stealing in between them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> Q.--Would you increase your sentries at any other time? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> A.--Yes, during foggy weather. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> Q.--Ought you to post your sentries thickly or not? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> A.--If possible, not, but it must depend on the nature of the ground and the state of the atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The great object should be to save my men as much as possible, always bearing in mind that every unnecessary sentry entails additional <hi rend="italics">duty on all his comrades.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> Q.--When the advance sentry is very near the enemy, what precautions would you take to secure his preservation? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> A.--I should place obstacles in the approaches to his post, about <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> in his front, as well as flanks, when it is practicable to do so, such as a battle, &#x0026;c., which the sentry could see over, <hi rend="italics">and so that they may not afford shelter to the enemy, </hi> in order to stop any sudden rush that might be made upon him. I should particularly take this precaution at night, or should, the sentry be placed at the end of a bridge where he must actually stand on the end of the defile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> Q.--Were you not to take this precaution, what might happen? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> A.--The sentry might be suddenly overcome, and not able to fire or give the alarm, and, consequently, the picquet might be surprised from being unable to get under arms in time to meet the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> Q.--Is it generally recommended that the <hi rend="italics">advanced</hi> sentries should be so protected? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> A.--Yes, where practicable, for the above reasons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> Q.--When a wood is in your front, how would you place your sentry? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> A.--As far from the wood as would be advisable, with a view of keeping as good a look out as possible, but being most particular not to endanger the sentry from a sudden rush from the wood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> Q.--How do you insure the body of the picquet being instantly made acquainted with any immediate threatened approach of the enemy? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> A.--By the communicating sentry firing, or making the preconcerted signal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> Q.--What regulates the actual position where you place the body of your picquet? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> A.--After having ascertained the most advantageous point for posting my advanced sentries, I place my picquet so as to be within hearing of the connecting sentries fire, and out of sight of the enemy, and as near the centre of my line of sentries as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> Q.--Do you examine the sentries as they are relieved? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> A.--Yes; in order to ascertain <sic>whather</sic> they have observed anything in their front, and, if of importance, immediately to report the circumstance to the field officer of the picquets, always taking care to state in my report whether the movements, or whatever demonstration was observed, was on <hi rend="italics">our</hi> right or the <hi rend="italics">enemy's</hi> left, or <hi rend="italics">vice versa.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> Q.--On receiving verbal orders from your superior, do you write them down immediately? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> A.--Yes, in order to give them over correctly to the officer of the new picquet that relieves me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Q.--Do you place the same men on the same posts during the time they are on picquet? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> A.--Yes; and I take care to place the most intelligent men on the most important stations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> Q.--Should a sentry or man from the picquet desert, what would you do? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> A.--Immediately inform the field officer of the day of the circumstance and the officers on my right and left, and be most careful of my immediate security. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> Q.--When you are permitted to have a fire for your picquet, where would you place it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> A.--As much out of observation as possible; and, in case the picquet should be attacked at night, I should previously point out the place for the alarm post, on the strangest and most defensible ground; and, if possible, in fear of the fire, in order that the enemy should be exposed themselves on coming up to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Q.--When do you <hi rend="italics">always</hi> get your picquet under arms? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> A.--<num value="1">One</num> hour before daybreak. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> Q.--How do you ensure your sentries looking in the right direction during dark? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> A.--By placing a place of stick horizontally on <num value="2">two</num> forked pegs in the direction of the enemy's post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>This precaution is to be taken side by the body of the picquet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> Q.--Under what circumstances should you retire your picquets? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> A.--When my flanks are thoroughly threatened, unless I have orders to defend my post to the last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> Q.--If forced to retire, in what direction would you fall back? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> A.--The field-officer of the day having shown me where the reserve a posted, I should retire upon it, firing and disputing the ground; and on approaching the reserve, I should order my picquet, which would be in extended order, to place itself on its flank, and not cloud its front by our retrograde movement, so as to impede its fire on the advancing enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> Q.--When you hear firing on your flank or flanks, which indicates a retrograde movement of the picquets posted there, what should you do? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> A.--I should retire throwing myself on the flank of the advancing enemy, of course keeping my retreat open to the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> Q.--If, after you have been relieved from your post, you hear firing in the front, what should you do? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> A.--I should immediately return and give my support to the advance picquets, and sideward of what I had done, to the field officer of the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> Q.--You have stated that a patrol is a body of troops varying in strength according to circumstances, sent out under commend of an officer, or N. C. officer, to gain information regarding the enemy; how many different sorts of patrols are laid down in the <rs>Regulations</rs> of our service? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> A.--<num value="2">Two</num>. <num value="1">One</num> for patrolling when the enemy is near; the other when the enemy is distant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> Q.--What should you do previously to going out with your patrol when the enemy is near?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>And how do you move? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> A.--I should inform the officer, or N. C. officer, on my flank from whence I start; that I am going to patrol. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> Q.--Do you always commence patrolling from a flank of your picquet? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> A.--As a general rule, yet; and return by the other, passing along the front of the lines of sentries, never out of their sight, if possible, during the day, nor out of hearing the report of a <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> at night, and move as silently as possible, often halting to listen, and recurring within the line of sentries to the place from whence I started. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> Q.--If you meet an enemy within the line of sentries, what do you do? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> A.--Immediately fire, and continue doing so, to give the alarm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> Q.--Should a patrol avoid firing as much as possible? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> A.--Yes, and give as little alarm as can be avoided to the picquet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> Q.--How should you act when ordered to patrol the enemy being <hi rend="italics">distant</hi>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> A.--I should move in the direction ordered as a small advance guard, with feelers in front, flankers, and connecting files, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> being men chosen for their quickness of <num value="8">eight</num> and her ring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> Q.--What should the advanced files and the feelers do if they hear any footsteps approaching? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> A.--They should instantly fall back to the patrol; and if a larger body than the party to which they belong was advancing, <num value="2">two</num> men should be sent back to the picquet to give information to the officer, who would take immediate measures accordingly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> Q.--What do the patrol do? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> A.--It realizes steadily, and, if possible, an observed, on the picquet but if observed and overtaken, it will keep up an incessant fire to give the alarm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Q.--Should a patrol fire on meeting an enemy's patrol? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> A.--If possible not, as it tends to alarm unnecessarily? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> Q.--Who should inform the conductors of the different patrols the route they should take? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> A.--The field officer of the day, who would also inform them the distance they should patrol to the front or flanks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> Q.--Do you send out a strong patrol just before daybreak? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> A.--Yes, towards the enemy, and this patrol must be very cautions, as this is generally the time the enemy makes his attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> Q.--What precaution should be taken on the return of the patrol? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> A.--They must often look to the rear on returning to ascertain that they are not followed, which is very frequently the case, and frequently halt to listen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> Q.--In what manner would you move a large patrol to the front? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> A.--In the same way as an advance guard, with advanced, connecting and flank files. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> When the magnificent operations of Succeed had laid the whole Eastern provinces of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> at the feel of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in the year <dateStruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></dateStruct>--earning for himself a dukedom and the <hi rend="italics">baton</hi> of marshal, and fully entitling him to the high eulogism afterwards pronounced by his master on the rock of St. Helena, that he was superior to <persName n="Soult,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Soult,nomatch:0"><surname>Soult</surname></persName> or any other of the <name>Marshals</name> &mdash; to all human appearance the cause of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> was lost forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>But the ways of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> are not to be understood by man. Out of the extremity of evil it often brings forth good, and out of the excess of good fortune it is wont to avoids destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>These great successes induced the <rs>French Emperor</rs> to believe that he should no longer experience any trouble in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and that he might now prosecute with safety the war with <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, which he had meditated for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and from which he had only been deterred by the complication of his affairs in the peninsula The result is but too well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The Grand Army plunged into the deserts of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, and was lost <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, like the <name>Ph</name>&#x0153;nix, arose from her sales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The very reveries that seemed to have extinguished her political existence had become the means of her salvation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> Such we solemnly believe is destined to be the result of the captures of New Orleans to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>We deplore that capture as greatly as though we had been <num value="1">one</num> of the citizens of that ill fated metropolis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>There is something inexpressibly humiliating to our pride, and to the pride of every Southern man, in the manner in which it was takes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It has been the cause of great temporary damage to the cause in the loss not only of arms and men, but of character, which is dearer than both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>We have just cause to dear that it will sink as low in the estimation of foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>But it will be productive of benefits which will more than counterbalance all these heavy disadvantages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> In the first place, as our neighbor of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs></hi> observes, it will convince foreign powers that the promise of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Seward,J.,L.,,:1"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> to supply them with cotton cannot be redeemed, even though he should conquer and open for trade all the cotton ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>They will find that, upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> alarm, all that material was destroyed; and they will soon perceive that no more will be brought in as long as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> continue in possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It will thus demonstrate that so far from having conquered us, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have scarcely taken a step in the direction of conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/><persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> will be saved part of the crime, and part of the scandal, whish result from his compact with <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Seward,J.,L.,,:1"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He will remain an instigator of the plunder, but he will have no opportunity to buy the stolen goods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> In the second place, the occupation of so large a city cannot but have a tendency to weaken the enemy, by extending his operations and diminishing his numbers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It will require a powerful detachment to keep possession of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/><q>&#x0022;A great city,&#x0022;</q> says <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;cannot be taken by the solar.&#x0022;</q>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The capture of New Orleans by <num value="2">two</num> old mortar boats, not even sheathed with iron, would seem to give a contradiction to this <hi rend="italics">diclum.</hi>--But, at least, if it can be taken by the collar, it is especially difficult to <hi rend="italics">hold</hi> it by the collar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>It is like holding a wolf by the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>If you hold on, the chances are that he will scratch out your entrails with his clown; if you let go, it is certain that he will tear you to pieces with his teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>In every aspect of the dilemma, it is but a bad <num value="1">one</num>, and it is of little importance which born may be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will find it difficult to keep New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>They will find it even <hi rend="italics">wore</hi> difficult to leave it. If the former, so much force as they have there (and it must be a large <num value="1">one</num>) will be as though it were buried; if the latter, the place will be re-occupied as soon as they tern their banks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> Lastly, and meet important of all, this occupation by the enemy releases <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> brave troops, and places them at the dispose of the <rs>Government</rs>, to be sent wherever their services may be required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Had <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> been in possession of these troops at <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, it would have enabled him to complete his victory before <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and thus probably to have destroyed the enemy before they could have reached their gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>On the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> he would have repulsed and utterly routed them with all their reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Their presence under his banner now would tell powerfully upon the issue of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It might be in fact decisive of it. Thus, it will be seen, that this reverse, if properly need, may turn out to be what affliction often are, a blessing in disguise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> So far are we from thinking it possible to decide this war by the capture of all our seaports, that, painful as it may be to surrender them, we should think our chances improved by the abandonment of all the towns we still hold within reach of the enemy gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/><placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> are each defended by powerful garrisons, brave men and tried soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Those men joined to our forces already in the field, in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, would enable our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to best the enemy, and probably destroy him on both these points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Do this, and we shall soon get back the towns which we only temporarily resign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>It is in the field, by the great armies, not in forts or fortified towns, that the contest must be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The enemy is aware of this, and he is very cautions in following us into the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>He is always striving to draw us within reach of his gunboats, and never likes to go beyond the range of their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>This ought to regulate our tactics, it seems to us, which certainly should aim to get him as far from deep water as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> As for the fall of New Orleans having the slightest influence upon the event of the war, we held that to be folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The fall of every seaport town would only strengthen us upon the critical points, while it would weaken the enemy by requiring large bodies for garrisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It is the spirit of the people alone that can determine the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>As long as that remains firm there is no danger of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>When that falls, then it is time to submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>As yet we see not the slightest abatement of hope &mdash; not the faintest intimation of despondency. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> manifest their jealousy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> on every trivial occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It seems that there is a British ship-of-war at <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName>, and her officers and men occasionally regale themselves with hurrahing for the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>An <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> correspondent of that excessively decent, veracious and honest journal, the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName>, is vastly indignant at the <name>Britons</name>, whilst enjoying the hospitalities of the harbor, to repay them after this wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>We were never aware before that the right of the vessel of a nation to cast anchor unmolested in the harbor of another was contrived an act of hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>But, this is <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle's idea of hospitality, viz: letting you lie out of doors, in sight of his front gate, whilst he snores comfortably within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>What an ungrateful rascal <persName n="Boll,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Boll,nomatch:0"><surname>Boll</surname></persName> must be not to appreciate such a gorgeous entertainment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> consoles himself over <persName n="Bull,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="nearbymention:Bull,John,,,"><surname>Bull</surname></persName>'s predilections for the <rs>South</rs> by declaring that the <name>Secession</name> ladies in <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> over whelmed them with attentions, and even transcended the verge of female propriety in their de <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> portment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The difficulty in giving currency to the slander which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle desires to insinuate is, that he has long ago lost his credit among all civilized people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>He has lied so persistently from the beginning of this war, he has invented so many and such extraordinary lies, that no <num value="1">one</num> be levels a word he says on any subject, and, knowing this, those who are the objects of his slanders are quite indifferent to anything he may utter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>We are glad to learn that there are Secession ladies in <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName>, and pleased to hear that they were polite to the <rs>British</rs> officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Anything more we know could not have happened--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, from our knowledge of the character of Southern ladies; and next, from the fact that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> says they behaved improperly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>If he had asserted that they conducted themselves with the most perfect propriety, then, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, we should begin to suspect something wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>This is the great disadvantage of lying all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>No <num value="1">one</num> pays any attention to anything habitual liars say. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> We are not surprised that our enemies should manifest such sensitiveness to the preferences of secessionists for <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName>, over the elegant and fascinating Doodle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>After the affectionate attentions he has lavished upon us of late, after endearments in word and deed which might have melted the heart of a tiger, can we have the base ingratitude to prefer such a wretch as <persName n="Buil,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="default:Buil,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Buil</surname></persName> to our loving and beneficent neighbor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The perversity of human nature is unaccountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>We are afraid that it will continue so to the end. Even if the valiant Doodle can subjugate our soil, he cannot conquer our hearts; he cannot make us love or respect, or do aught else but bate him, and wish him all manner of curses, and pray day and night that Heaven will visit upon him at last the just retribution of his sine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>He cannot prevent us from wishing well to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and from preferring each and all of them, and the <name>Turks</name> and Algerians, to the barbarians who declare we shall be their slaves or be exterminated, and who bombard towns and cities full of women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It is true, we owe no favors to any foreign nation, but, nevertheless, we owe them justice; and, we know of none whose history and character do not entitle them to stand higher in the esteem of the world than the unfragrant abomination known as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Moreover, as it seems to give disquiet to that people, we should on that account alone, and for the simple purpose of annoying them as much as possible, give all manner of preference in every way whatever to <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs> and Spaniards, those highly civilized and truly valiant people, over the pilfering and peddling crew who are attempting to thrust their wooden nutmegs down our throats at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>If we could not, the system was a failure, which he was not prepared to acknowledges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>He dwelt upon the supposed rights derived from the fact of existing war. Plausible as this might seem, he thought it unwarrantable to derive such rights from our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Though other nations might recognize them as belligerents, he did not see how we could, or any attempt be made to legislate against them as belligerents and enemies with any property and consistency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/> He did not believe we could legislate our selves out of the war any more than we could legislate ourselves into a millennium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>It is true, legislation might be necessary for a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>The machinery of State governments was again to be put into operation, or their condition would not be restored as before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C. held that they had <num value="2">two</num> branches of duty in connection with the war--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to put down armed resistance by force of arms, and then to bring back the rebellious States to loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Such a bill as this was not calculated to effect the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>The people in the rebellious States were subject to the influences of the circumstances by which they were surrounded, as were other people &mdash; a <hi rend="italics">de facts</hi> Government had been set up by a certain class among them, and now they had to be protected and rescued from its power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>That was the duty of the <rs>Government</rs>, and not the attempting of wholesale confiscations, involving whole communities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/> He cited the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> declaring that no <num value="1">one</num> shall be deprived of his property except by process of law, &#x0026;c. That was a prohibition against every <num value="1">one</num>--against Congress itself &mdash; and was put in the <rs>Constitution</rs> especially to prevent our doing such a thing when we might want to do it. A good deal of hocus pocus was displayed in talking about proceedings <hi rend="italics">in rem.</hi> in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The Constitution, if a man is guilty of treason, says it is a crime, and you may punish him in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>That's all. It provides nothing about his property, which is the proceeding <hi rend="italics">in rem. </hi> But this bill proposes <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to punish him in <num value="1">one</num> way and then in the other, which the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> are intended to guard against. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> He denied that it was a proper rules to do whatever you have the physical means to do, and declared that it made very little difference what department of the <rs>Government</rs> all these usurpations go to. If Congress assumes to control the army; conduct the war, and sent its committees out into the field to inspect the acts of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, etc, he did not see that it was any better than the act of the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName> in the days of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It was a tyranny and a usurpation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> He discussed the idea so freely expressed of conquering the rebellious States, repudiating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It as unsound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>We had conquered <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, It was said; but did we pretend to own anything there &mdash; the <rs>Capitol</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>, the <rs>State</rs> institutions, &#x0026;c No. Therefore we had only done the duty of affording protection &mdash; He discussed also the military power, and as confiscation was claimed as a <q>&#x0022;military necessity&#x0022;</q> it of course belonged to that department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>It was for the <rs>President</rs> and his officers to determine in special instances as they carried on the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C. next treated of the punishment of rebellious persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>As to hanging <num value="100000">100,000</num> men or <num value="10000">10,000</num> or anything like it, nothing was more absurd than to talk of it. He hoped no <num value="1">one</num> even desired or hoped for such a thing.--Exemplary punishment, however, could be visited upon certain individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>But this could only be done when we had the power to do it. What we want is some law to put power in the hands of the <rs>President</rs> to induce those people to come back to their allegiance after we have taken possession sufficiently of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>He could not, by any possibility, see a path to peace through such a bill as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Some citizens in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> had send to the <rs>Federal General</rs> in command asking for protection to their property, but under this bill they would have no property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Let it be passed, and the officer would reply, <q> &#x0022;You have no property &mdash; Congress has confiscated it all.&#x0022;</q> Thus these entire people would be without homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>But it was urged that money was wanted for the treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Well, who would buy a farm in that country under these circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>It would require <num value="2">two</num> regiments to protect every such plantation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> branch of the bill, which evidently was intended to free a large body of slaves, and without that feature he believed there were some of his friends here who would not care a cent about the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>There was no proceeding provided in the case: it simply declared the slaves free &mdash; without any actual capture in war, or getting possession of the property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>If this was not taking men's property, without process of law, he did not know what was. It was not even by proceeding <hi rend="italics">in rem.</hi> He referred to the pledges of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> in regard to not interfering in the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the <name>States</name>, and asked, in view of such an for as this, can you expect to make the world believe you have not interfered with slavery in the <name>States</name> ! It was a direct violation of the securities which the <rs>Constitution</rs> enacts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>He did not believe that his people wished him to do anything in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and if they did, they know that he would not gratify their desire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C. next spoke of the character of the substitute which he proposed for the bill, by which imprisonments were provided not less than <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, and fines imposed of not less than <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">$10,000</measure>, which could be collected in the usual way, when not duly paid, out of the property of the culprit, as in other cases of crime &mdash; thus avoiding the question of forfeitures, and the legal &mdash; difficulties in the way of such being effective beyond life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>In the mean time the <rs>President</rs> to be armed with power to issue proclamations at his discretion, and fixing a day by which people could return to loyalty and receive pardon. </p>
