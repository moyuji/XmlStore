<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> --Even in time of peace, we have found that the most popular subject with newspaper readers is always battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Men will read about battles when they will not read about anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Much more, then, will they read about the events of war, now that we are in the midst of war. We hope, therefore, we shall be excused for running briefly over a few of the campaigns which are celebrated in history as remarkable <hi rend="italics">defensive</hi> campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It will be seen that there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as a campaign <hi rend="italics">purely</hi> defensive, but that in every campaign the party defending sometimes takes the initiative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We begin with <persName n="Maximus,,Fabius,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Maximus,Fabius,,,"><foreName>Fabius</foreName> <surname>Maximus</surname></persName>, who gave name to what is called the <name>Fabian</name> system &mdash; a system, by the by, greatly misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Fabius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Fabius,nomatch:0"><surname>Fabius</surname></persName> was appointed <hi rend="italics">Pro-Dictator</hi> immediately after the bloody defeat of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> army at Thrasymene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The system which he adopted was probably the only <num value="1">one</num> that could have saved the republic; but it was not a purely defensive system &mdash; that is, he did not always wait to be attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>On the contrary, although he harassed his enemy &mdash; and that enemy, be it recollected, was <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> &mdash; by a series of skillful movements, marching, counter-marching, choosing unassailable positions, and never allowing himself to be drawn into a general engagement, yet no man was more prompt in seizing every opportunity to attack, when it could be done to advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Nowhere upon the page of history is recorded such burning patriotism, such universal devotion to the cause of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Never can we sufficiently praise their heroism and courage, and thank them for the gallant manner in which they checked the <q> &#x0022;onward march to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022;</q>--march of the thievish <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs> on the memorable <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> But in our enthusiasm, let us not forget that <sic>that</sic> army enlisted for only <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, and, judging from present appearances, their term will have expired long before this flendish attempt at oppression ceases; and it is but right and just that they be allowed to return to their homes, and afford the in &#x0022;incible militia the opportunity and the privilege of striking for <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> and their country.&#x0022;</q> But, in order that they may become effective soldiers before they are required on the field, and thus prevent any discrimination in the efficacy of our arms, it seems to be an established fact that, unless they volunteer <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> previous to that time, a draft will be issued by the <rs>Executive</rs> about the last of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, giving them <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> to become thoroughly drilled, and accustomed to handling the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>And certainly there need be no fears about the result, when our destiny is confided to the trust of such men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> But it appears to me, after carefully watching with painful solicitude the progress of the various diseases prevalent during the summer months throughout our camps, that every effort should be made to prevent a re-appearance of all these fevers the ensuing summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Of course, where there are so many men congregated together, there must necessarily be some sickness; but it cannot be denied that there has been an unusual amount of it among our troops, and also in a very malignant form, owing in a very great degree to the fact that our soldiers were called upon to leave their homes in the spring of the year &mdash; a season more unfavorable than any other for making such an entire change in our mode of living, and in all our habits; because then the naturally relaxed state of the system makes it more susceptible of disease than at any other time, even when surrounded by all the comforts and conveniences of home; and of course the danger of contracting disease becomes greater in proportion to the exposures and hardships which the recruit, entirely unaccustomed to, is subjected to in camp life.--At least such is the opinion of the most skillful and intelligent surgeons with whom I have conversed on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>And certainly the opinion seems to be amply sustained, if we compare the sickness among our volunteers with that of the regulars during the past summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The latter being accustomed to that mode of living, escaped with comparatively little sickness, whilst a distressing number of the former was swept away by the destroyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Then the conclusion forces itself upon my mind that the most certain way of escaping pneumonia, typhoid, and numberless other fevers, is for the men to volunteer this fall.--They would serve just the same length of time if they would volunteer now, and become hardened to camp life during the healthy months of winter, as they would if they defer it till spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Then, let each and all, remembering that the preservation of their health is a duty they owe their country, as well as themselves, bravely come forward now, and take their positions on the side of right and justice, and in defence of political and religious freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/> Before the commencement of the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion the <rs>London</rs> journals had a habit of decrying the democratic freedom of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>It was told us by the <rs>English</rs> press that we had too much liberty; that the reins of Government were not held tight enough; that there was too little restraint upon individual caprise &mdash; in fact, that we were not much better than a huge transatlantic mob. But since the commencement of the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion the <rs>English</rs> press has changed its tone, and, from having no Government at all, we are accused of supporting too strong a Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>If we are to believe what is told to the <rs>British</rs> public by their own newspapers there is more anarchy in New York than in <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, less individual liberty than under the iron grasp of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>, and a more complete despotism than the present Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> never existed; liberty of the press and speech are at an end, and, with the revocation of all our former liberties, a reign of terror has been inaugurated far and wide; the habeas corpus is repealed and personal liberty forfeited with a stroke of the pen and without pretence of trial; spies are everywhere peeping into letters and overhearing political conversations, and, by the introduction of the odious passport system, <hi rend="italics">finis republica</hi> has been written in plain letters on the document which authorized it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>But they are as erroneous as those erring in the opposite extreme which preceded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>It is true that there is now less liberty of the press and speech than there was when we were in a state of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>In what country, however, where a great rebellion was in process of being put down by the sword, would there not be a curtailment of the freedom of unpatriotic speech and writing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>And is not the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> a nearly parallel case? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/> The reports of the vagabond correspondents of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> and other journals doubtless lead to the belief that things are pretty much as their editors describe them to be; but they, finding themselves roughly handled in criticism here, write home startling and doleful accounts of the state of public affairs, which far exceed the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>Yet there is liberty enough left to allow of the re-publication of these in every <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>We admit that things are in a bad state, but, after all, not as bad as we anticipated; and as for the conclusions drawn from existing facts by the <rs>English</rs> press, we are at a loss to understand how sober <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> can so easily arrive at what to us is the height of absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>The measures &mdash; undoubtedly oppressive to a few &mdash; which have been adopted by the <rs>Government</rs>, in order to prevent aid and comfort being given to the enemy, will be withdrawn as soon as the war is over, and we shall then resume our normal condition.
