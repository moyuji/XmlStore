<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> There are many claims to novelty and originality in this invention, and apparent advantages not combined in any of the numerous fire-arms of the kind now before the public &mdash; chief among them are its extreme simplicity and cheapness of construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>While it can be loaded and discharged as rapidly as the best of our breech-loading arms &mdash; and under protracted use, perhaps faster &mdash; and while its force of fire and accuracy of range cannot be excelled, it can also be constructed as cheap as the common rifle or musket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> Another important advantage, not presented by any other arms using common paper cartridges, is its reliability in any emergency, since it cannot be affected by water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The charge cannot be damaged by rain or any inclemency of weather; while the rifle can be loaded in any position &mdash; advancing or retreating, lying flat on the ground, or during the swiftest movements on horseback, or in daylight or dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The cartridge itself contains the igniting principle, and all the elements of the explosive material &mdash; powder and percussion &mdash; all exerted effectively on the projectile, and from the mode in which the powder is packed and ignited, no recoil is produced, and the bursting of the rifle is impossible; in this fact a scientific principle is developed long sought after in fire-arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Several of these rifles have been subjected to severe trials at long ranges, and under severe tests, and have invariably proved equal to any emergency. </p>
