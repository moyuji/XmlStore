<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The altered tone of both the <rs>English</rs> and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers, when they speak of each others respective country, is the most remarkable incident connected with journalism in these latter days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Before this war had revealed the strength of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--while they were still entire &mdash; the language held by the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> with regard to them was always slight, often sneering, and, on some occasions, absolutely insulting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, it spoke of the ease with which Britain had throttled &#x0022;the <rs>Northern</rs> gains, &#x0022; <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, and intimated that it could, at the same time, with all the ease imaginable, administer castigation to <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Even after the war had actually commenced on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, while the parties were marshaling their forces and preparing for the mighty conflict that was so shortly to ensue, the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> indulged its satirical vein, without stint, at the expense of the combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>After the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> it told the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that they had mistaken their calling; that they never could be a great military nation, how great soever might be their aspirations after military fame; that &#x0022;war was not in their line of business,&#x0022; and that, to excel, they must take to something else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>When <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> were piratically seized on a British vessel upon the high seas, by a ship belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the tone of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> was, beyond measure, bold, insolent and defiant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> At the same time, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press was as obsequious and cringing as the <rs>British</rs> press was arrogant and domineering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Both are wonderfully altered since that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is now as loud and insulting as he was formerly meek and submissive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The change has not taken by surprise any person who has been accustomed to study the policy of the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>That Government has always been famous for dealing out what it calls exemplary justice upon culprits whom it believes unable to help themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Let not such hope to escape the lash of <name>British</name> vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><placeName reg="Ellas" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Brasil" key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, or any of the little States on the <name>Continent</name> &mdash; such as <placeName reg="Danmark, Europe, " key="tgn,1000066">Denmark</placeName>, for instance,--cannot hope to escape upon any conceivable pretext whenever it may be so unfortunate as to incur the wrath of the <rs>British</rs> lion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is only strength that secures impunity from that magnanimous animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Even now the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> is calling upon the <rs>British Queen</rs> to revoke her proclamation of neutrality &mdash; that is, we suppose, to take part with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their war upon this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We do not see why this should not be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It would be perfectly consistent with the whole conduct of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> throughout the war. Should <persName n="Adams,Ambassador,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Ambassador">Ambassador</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> choose to demand it, a good-natured, easy soul like <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> could hardly refuse so small a favor to his amiable ally, after having already granted him so many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He has already placed <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> at his disposal; he has but to stretch out his hand to grasp it. Why refuse anything, when so much has already been given, we ask again? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> We sometimes feel disposed to be a little astonished at the facility with which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has been brought to play <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> fiddle in this concert of the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Who that lived a century, or even <num value="0.5">a half</num> century ago, would have believed it possible that such a thing could ever happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But we suppose it is with governments as with individuals: the greatest bullies are always the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to succumb when real danger presents itself. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Thus it becomes our mournful duty to record the death of <num value="2">two</num> most honored representatives of a past generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>After a matrimonial union of <measure n="52years" type="date">fifty-two years</measure>, they both lie together, side by side, into bosom of the family cemetery, at their old home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The writer of these lines has known those deceased friends for many years, and considers that he writes but the simple truth in saying that they faithfully filled up the measure of every duty growing out of all the relations which they sustained in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They were the kindest of friends; their hospitality was unbounded in time of war as well as peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They were most genial, cheerful and pleasant companions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> They were most devoted parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The happiness of their children was <num value="1">one</num> of the chief earthly objects of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>For them, they loved to live and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They were most useful citizens &mdash; industriously engaged in the discharge of their duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>They augmented their own resources and the prosperity of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Their servants, too, will remember them as their greatest benefactors; and, at their burial, these servants were among the saddest mourners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><persName n="Christian,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Christian,William,N.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName><surname n="Christian"></surname></persName> and <persName n="Christian,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:Christian,William,N.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Christian</surname></persName> long since gave their hearts to the <rs>Lord</rs> and their hands to the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>From the earliest acquaintance of the writer with them &mdash; which was many years ago &mdash; until the time of their death, they were consistent, pious and honored members of the <orgName n="Methodist Episcopal Church" type="church">Methodist Episcopal Church</orgName>; and in every way they adorned the doctrine of their high profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Living, they confessed <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> before men; and dying, their Saviours made their dying beds &#x0022;feel soft as downy pillows are.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> <persName n="Christian,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="nearbymention:Christian,William,N.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Christian</surname></persName> died at her home, which had been desolated by the enemy before her death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>She breathed her last in the midst of her family, which she so ardently loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>She was patient, calm and perfectly resigned during the pains of protracted illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>When it was apparent that she must soon die, she had no regret to express.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Her lamp was trimmed and burning, and filled with the oil of divine grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>She was perfectly willing to die; for she was fully assured that she had made her peace with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and that heaven was her home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Thus has passed away <num value="1">one</num> of the most estimable <name>Christian</name> ladies that it has ever been the privilege of the writer to know. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> Not many days after the death of <persName n="Christian,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Christian,William,N.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Christian</surname></persName>, her husband, <persName n="Christian,Mister,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="default:Christian,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Christian</surname></persName>, was arrested by the public enemy; and, without making known the ground of their action, they marched him off to <placeName><persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The domestic affliction of the family did not elicit the sympathy of the foe. They mocked at the grief of his <num value="2">two</num> daughters, who were left alone with the servants at their country home when their father was thus from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The only response which the enemy condescended to their grief was that &#x0022;old age and sickness had played out.&#x0022; On arriving at <placeName><persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s quarters</placeName>, he was not granted an interview with the <rs>General</rs>, but was confined with the prisoners in a literal slaughter pen, without shelter, exposed to all the inclemencies of a rigorous winter, with show on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He remained for <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> in the enemy's hands, until, at last, overcome by exposure and harsh treatment, this true specimen of a Virginia gentleman sank down into the arms of death and the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He was the victim of murderers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> He was urged, whilst a prisoner, to take the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; by doing so he might probably have secured his release.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But he spurned the proffer, preferring infinitely death to dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>He died as he had lived, a spotless <name>Christian</name> gentlemen &mdash; bequeathing to his children the richest legacy in his example, and eliciting the admiration of his brutal foes by his unfaltering consistency and devotion to his principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>His body has been secured by friends and placed in the family burying-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It awaits the sound of the trumpet at the <name>Morning</name> of the <name>Resurrection</name>, when it will stand honored as a martyr to truth and consistency. </p> <closer> <signed>W.
