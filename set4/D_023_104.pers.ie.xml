<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>A close and severe student, devoted to the holy profession which he had adopted, he had appeared but for a moment at his sister's ball, and then in the retirement of his own apartment had spent his evening as calmly among his books as if the sound of pipe and tabor had fallen on a deafened ear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> A vague feeling of curiosity led him to enter the saloon, and he smiled in derision, as the faint light, struggling through the half open windows, revealed the melancholy, dilapidated look, which is always worn by a <q>&#x0022;banquet hall deserted.&#x0022;</q> But what was his surprise, when, extended on a couch, he observed the figure of the young and lovely <persName n="Isabel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Isabel,nomatch:0"><surname>Isabel</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>But of woman in unadorned loveliness &mdash; woman armed only with her own gentle helplessness &mdash; woman, the object of tender care and cherishing, he had never before dreamed, and he gazed as if spell-bound on the unconscious girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>She was ill, seriously ill, her exposure to the weather on the previous night, and the short slumber which she had snatched in the cold, comfortless drawing-room, had struck a chill through her fragile frame, that she could with difficulty move her aching limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>But day after day that delicate figure, lying in all the graceful abandonment of sleep, appeared before his mental vision; night after night did that sweet face look out upon him from the huge folios where he ought only to have seen the severe features of philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> I, for <num value="1">one</num>, said the right honorable gentleman, exercising my own poor faculties as best I could, have never felt that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had any reason connected with her own civil interests for desiring the disruption of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>I can understand those who say it is for the general interest of nations that no State should swell to the dimensions of a continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>I can understand those who say &mdash; and I confess it to be my own opinion &mdash; that it is greatly for the interest of the negro race that they should have to do with their own masters alone, and not &mdash; as has hitherto been the case &mdash; with their own masters backed by the whole power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>[Cheers.] Because, pray observe, that has been the state of things that has subsisted heretofore, and to which some, I think mistakenly, in the interest of the negro, have thought it desirable to return. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The laws by which the slaves have been governed have been laws made not by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, but by the owners of those slaves; but the enforcement of the laws made by the owners of the slaves has not rested in the hands of the owners of the slaves alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>They have a right &mdash; a constitutional right by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>--to be supported against their own slaves in the execution of the laws that the slave-owners have made by the whole power of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>I can, therefore, very well understand the argument of those who think that it is particularly to be desired in the interest of the negro race that the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> should be reconstructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>But I must confess, for reasons that I need not now explain, that I do not think that <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> has had any interest in the disruption of that Union; my own private opinion is that it was rather the interest of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> that the <rs>Union</rs> should continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>I know that it is not an opinion generally shared; but at any rate, gentlemen, whatever view we may take of that, I think we all feel that the course which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> ministers have endeavored to pursue &mdash; namely, that of maintaining a strict neutrality under all circumstances that have heretofore passed &mdash; has been a right course, and has been the expression of the general sense of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>[Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> There is, and there can be, no doubt that where <num value="2">two</num> parties are in great exasperation, it is not at all unlikely that he who observes a strict neutrality will offend both; because, in point of fact, the state of mind in which his conduct is likely to be judged of for the moment by either disputant is not a state of mind in which it is fair that we should expect from them perfectly impartial conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>But what we may naturally expect is this: that an honest course of neutrality will be recognized &mdash; that course, I mean, which we have pursued up to this day &mdash; will be recognized after this unhappy struggle has passed away, and when the circumstances shall be calmly viewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>But, I must confess it appears to me that if either party have a right to find fault with us, it is the <rs>Confederate</rs> rather than the <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>[Hear, hear.] I mean this: If we have deviated at all from neutrality, our deviation has been against the <rs>Confederate</rs> rather than the <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The course we have taken has been this: We have preserved a perfect neutrality; but we have permitted the export of arms and warlike stores &mdash; we have permitted it to <num value="2">two</num> parties &mdash; to the <rs>Confederates</rs>, all of whose ports were blockaded by the <orgName n="Northern fleet" type="fleet">Northern fleet</orgName>, and to the <rs>Federal</rs>, who have had perfect power to import whatever arms and stores they pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>I think that course has been the right and just course; but I think the very statement of the fact proves that at any rate we have not displayed a bias unfavorable to the claims of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>[Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> But no, gentlemen, I would for a moment make an appeal to you on behalf of the people of the <rs>Northern States</rs>--I mean so far as regards our appreciation of their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Greater allowances are to be made for heat and exasperation in the state of public opinion in that country under present circumstances than perhaps could ever fairly be claimed by any other nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Only consider what their private history has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They have never drank the bitter cup of misfortune, disappointment and mortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>They have had but to will that a thing should be done, and it was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Their course has been a course of prosperity and advancement without example and without a single break.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Well, gentlemen, it is not in human nature that a people who have been subjected to an experience so flattering, so soothing to human self love, should at once learn, with a perfectly good grace, to accommodate and submit itself to the necessities of our human condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>[Hear, hear.] It is easy for us to suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We have suffered before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>We have gone through the very agonies of those dismemberments against which the <rs>Northern</rs> people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are now struggling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>We have gone through it, and now that we have gone through it we know that it was not a bad thing after all. [Hear.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> But they have not gone through it, and all I say is, let us bear with them all we can. Let us keep towards them a kindly temper; let us not allow ourselves to be adversely criticised on that side of the water; let us be very cautious of adverse criticisms upon them from this side of the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Depend upon it, that course steadily pursued will bring its reward, and it is the course which they have a right, upon every ground of good will, courtesy, and <name>Christian</name> feeling, to expect that we should pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>[Cheers.] Why, gentlemen, they are our kin; they were, at any rate, if they are not now, our customers, and we hope they will be our customers again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>But they have shown also that, under all circumstances, when their good feeling could have fair play, they have warm affections towards <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Never let us forget, whatever momentary irritation may cross the minds of that people &mdash; never let us forget the reception of the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>[Cheers.] Let every <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> engrave upon the tablets of his heart the recollection of that memorable day; and if occasionally he may be tempted to anger at seeing his country misapprehended, or even misrepresented, let him calm his tendency to excited sentiment by that recollection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>[Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> And, gentlemen, it is the more necessary that we should do this, because I think we are pretty much of <num value="1">one</num> mind as to what is to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We know quite well that people &mdash; I mean the people of the <rs>Northern States</rs>--have not yet drank of the cup; they are still endeavoring to hold it far from their lips; they have not yet drank of the cup which, notwithstanding, all the rest of the world sees they must do. [Hear, hear.] We have our own opinions about slavery; we may be for the <rs>South</rs> or against the <rs>South</rs>; but there is no doubt, I think, about this &mdash; <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and the other leaders of the <rs>South</rs> have made an army; they are making, it appears, a navy; and they have made what is more than either &mdash; they have made a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>[Enthusiastic cheering, which was prolonged for some time] I cannot say that I, for <num value="1">one</num>, have viewed with any regret their failure to establish themselves in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>It appears, to me too probable that, if they had been able to establish themselves in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, the consequence of their mili- <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> tary success in any aggressive movement would have been that a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, favorable to them, would have been formed in that State--that they would have contracted actual or virtual engagements with that <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, and that the existence of these engagements hampering them in their negotiations with the <rs>Northern States</rs>, might have formed a new obstacle to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Gentlemen, from the bottom of our hearts we should desire that no new obstacles to peace may be formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>[Hear, hear, and cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> We may anticipate with certainty the success of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, so far as regards effecting their separation from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>I, for my own part, cannot but believe that event is as certain as any event yet future and contingent can be, [Cheers.] But it is from feeling that great event is likely to arise, and that the <rs>North</rs> will have to suffer that mortification, that I earnestly hope that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will do nothing to inflict additional shame, sorrow or pain upon those who have already suffered much, and who will probably have to suffer more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>[Cheers.] It may be that a time might arrive when it would be the duty of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to offer a word of expostulation, or of friendly aid, toward composing the quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It is even possible that such a time as that may arrive, how important it is that when that word comes it should address itself to minds that are embittered by the recollection that unkind things have been said and done towards them in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and above all in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the country which, however they may find fault with it from time to time, we know holds the highest place in their admiration and respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Recognition by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will not itself add a feather's weight to the material and moral aid and comfort which the rebels are to-day receiving from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It will only be a rechristening of the rebels as belligerents, a character from which they already draw numerous great advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>If the rebels, after being recognized, should ask the good offices of the recognizing powers as mediators, we should spurn their interference, and if they attempted to enforce it by arms they would learn that <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> is a great nation, and does not resemble the sick man of the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> The recent movements of our forces have led to the impression in some quarters that the entire evacuation of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName> was designed, or that these movements were made with reference to the reported advance of the enemy under <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, through <placeName reg="Loudoun, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7015770">Loudoun county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Our own information on the subject, derived from quarters deemed reliable, leads us to believe that the change of position recently made by our army was effected without regard to either of the contingencies above referred to. From all we can gather, we are satisfied that a general advance of the enemy's forces is not anticipated, and that our Government, which rather desires such a move mention the part of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, will be disappointed for the present campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>The recent reports of an advance amount to but little, and the operations of the enemy, so far as they have transpired, do not indicate that they will risk an engagement with the well appointed and highly disciplined troops under <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="nearbymention:Lee,C.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> A close investigation into the management of the <rs>Commissary</rs> and <rs>Quartermaster</rs>'s departments of the army would we think, disclose a degree of recklessness entirely inexcusable, and which is well calculated to depreciate the currency of the <rs>Government</rs>, if it has no other evil effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>When the army retired from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and took position in the lower Valley, there was a considerable amount of bacon and other supplies in the country, which had been readily sold to the families of soldiers and others at moderate prices &mdash; bacon ranging from <num value="16">16</num> to <measure n="20cents" type="currency">20 cents</measure> per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing done by our commissaries was to put up the prices, and those who had bacon for sale were at once offered <measure n="35cents" type="currency">35 cents</measure> per pound, and at this price the country was gleaned of its meat supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The same meat might have been purchased for <measure n="20cents" type="currency">20 cents</measure>, and the farmers who sold it would have been perfectly satisfied, and would have had infinitely more confidence in Confederate funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Besides depreciating the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>, such recklessness is well calculated to produce suffering among the families of soldiers who have to purchase their provisions.--Because provisions are bringing any price that extortioners choose to demand in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, it is no reason why the agents of the <rs>Government</rs> should put the prices up upon people of other sections of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/> In conversations with a number of farmers of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, recently, we were frequently asked the question whether the <rs>Government</rs> intended to redeem its circulation, the inference being drawn from its unnecessary expenditure that Confederate money was only being used for the present exigency and that final repudiation would ensue from the extravagance of the <rs>Government</rs>'s commissioned agents. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
