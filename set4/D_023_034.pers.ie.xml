<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The orator could not imagine what the man in the crowd was at. He had never beard of the <q> &#x0022;small-tail&#x0022;</q> movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>No description of it was to be found in any book of tactics he had ever read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>At the same time it would never do to confess ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He therefore did the best he could <q>&#x0022;under the circumstances.&#x0022;</q> He denied, vehemently and peremptorily, that <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,William,Henry,,:1"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName> had ever made the <q>&#x0022;small-tail&#x0022;</q> movement, and called upon his vilifier to prove the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Thus challenged, that individual ran his hand into his pocket, and produced a book, which proved to be a Life of <persName n="Harrison,General,William,Henry,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="default:Harrison,William,Henry,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Harrison</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>He turned to the very page on which an account of the battle was printed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> There was no such thing as resisting this rally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The laugh was turned against the speaker, and he retired, confounded and discomfited. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> Now, like the speaker on this occasion, we have no conception of the true meaning of the <q> &#x0022;small-tail movement.&#x0022;</q> From the sound, however, we presume it must indicate some very ignominious description of tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We hold it. therefore, to be certain that it was made by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> in his late <q>&#x0022;change of base.&#x0022;</q> For a victory, that certainly was <q>&#x0022;a novel,&#x0022;</q> and therefore, according to the <name>Hoister</name> philologist, <q>&#x0022;a small-tail&#x0022;</q> movement.--What else could it be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>A General, after <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> of preparation, arrives within shelling distance of a city, throws up enormous fortifications, loads them with <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>, and is suddenly attacked by his enemy, forced to leave his entrenchments, loses a vast quantity of his artillery, leaves nearly half his army dead or prisoners, and only stope when he finds himself under the protection of his gunboats, <measure n="35miles" type="distance">thirty five miles distant</measure> from the point at which he was to make his attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Surely, if the <q> &#x0022;small-tail movement&#x0022;</q> have any meaning, this must be it.
