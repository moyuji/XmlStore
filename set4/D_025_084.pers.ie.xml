<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>How the poor are to live during the winter is a question that has been frequently asked in times past, but it may be pertinent to ask now, under the present aspect of affairs, how the great bulk of the population of our cities are to keep from actual starvation without a change in the present system of warfare carried on by these greedy dupes of mammon and enemies to our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These counterfeits, are especially dangerous; from the fact that spurious issues of <num value="1">one</num> of them were made a year ago or more, and the discrepancies between the genuine and the counterfeit then pointed out by the papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This new spurious issue has corrected all the errors and variations of the former counterfeits of the same date and denomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi> says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> counterfeit is of the denomination of <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>, interest bearing note, dated <date value="1862-09-01">Sept. 1st, 1862,</date> printed by Keatinge &#x0026; Ball, <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia, S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The imprint immediately under is in larger letters than in the genuine, and the b in <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> is defective, whereas it is perfect in the genuine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In the genuine the line &#x0022;with interest at <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure> per day&#x0022; is printed on the red shade of the large red word &#x0022;<num value="100">hundred</num>.&#x0022; This shade does not show in the counterfeit, or, if at all, too faintly to be noticed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The whole execution of the counterfeit is inferior the that of the genuine, and the note a little smaller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The date of the genuine note is filled in <date value="09-01">Sept. 1st,</date> that of the counterfeit <dateStruct value="-09-1"><month reg="09">Sept'r</month> <day reg="1">1</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> is more difficult to describe and detect than the <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>, and is the most dangerous counterfeit we have ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We have a counterfeit and a genuine bill before us, and save that the counterfeit has been printed with too much ink, and therefore looks much blurred, it would be very difficult to distinguish the <num value="1">one</num> from the other; and we are not sure that this would he a reliable test, as even the genuine bills are not always uniform in color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The only obvious difference is, that in the genuine there is a clear space between the tops of the letters in the word &#x0022;<placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>&#x0022; and the waves under the large ship in the centre, whereas in the counterfeit the heads of these letters run quite up to the waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In the counterfeit we have there is a plain unshaded capital F to the left of the large ornamented letter A, which indicates the issue of the note; in the genuine before us there is none, nor do we recollect to have seen any genuine notes with such letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In the genuine, just above the letter A, and a little to the right, is the <num value="23">number 23</num>, which is not in the counterfeit. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> --In the year <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> our townsman, <persName n="Mitchell,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="default:Mitchell,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, being at the time in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, wrote a letter to a Charleston paper, the object of which was to prove that &#x0022;Cotton was not <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>,&#x0022; and that the reliance placed upon it to force a recognition from the <rs>Western Powers</rs>, especially <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, was slender and precarious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>He stated that, in his opinion, <num value="1">one</num> great object of the war with <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>, then just concluded, was undertaken mainly with a view to open the cotton trade with the <rs type="place">valley of the Yang</rs>-tse Kiang and its dependencies &mdash; a district several times larger than the whole cotton region of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, swarming with an industrious population, willing and anxious to work at wages incredibly low, and adapted by soil and climate to the production of the very articles which formed the staples of Southern exportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>He suggested that as soon as this trade could be developed that region would be a most formidable rival of the <rs>South</rs> in the cotton trade, and that as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had long felt the inconvenience of depending on a single country for her supply, she would spare no pains to promote the cultivation of the plant in this new quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>This view of the case was, at the time, quite new to us; and was the occasion of several articles in this paper, in which we endeavored to give it all the weight which we thought it certainly deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/><persName n="Mitchell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, however, and we after him, left entirely out of view <num value="1">one</num> consideration, which has since proved to be of the utmost importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The <rs>English</rs> and <rs>French</rs> were able to take <placeName reg="Pekin, Tazewell, Illinois" key="tgn,2029611">Pekin</placeName>, but they were not able to make the <name>Chinese</name> exchange commodities, or take anything for their goods but silver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>If the <rs>English Government</rs> really designed to develop the cotton trade of the Yang-tse-Kiang to the extent of erecting the region which it waters into a rival of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs>, it failed from this circumstance, and must continue to fail until it shall have conquered the country and introduced a system of exchanges very different from any that exists there now. Cotton <hi rend="italics">might have been</hi> king, in spite of <persName n="China,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:China,nomatch:0"><surname>China</surname></persName>, although in reality it never was. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Our Congress and our <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, possessed with the idea that the imperial plant already possessed the prerogative and the splendor that is its birthright, neglected to adopt the only measures by means of which it could assert its right to the diadem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>They stood up to their very knees in gold, and they turned from it in disdain, to substitute for it an irredeemable paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>We see the result in the deluge of assignats which overwhelms the country &mdash; in the enormous inflation of prices &mdash; in the scarcity and dearness of the necessaries of life &mdash; in the rabid thirst for gain which has maddened the inhabitants of the whole land &mdash; in the progressive depreciation of the currency &mdash; in the discontent of all classes &mdash; in the reluctance with which producers part with their commodities, and, above all, in the bills which are maturing in our Legislature against the various mal-practices which the state of the currency has fostered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The mischief has been don; it is now the part of wisdom not to waste time in grieving over that which is already beyond the reach of remedy, but to apply the best and speediest means of cure which may yet be within our power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> The inflation of the currency and its consequent reduction in value lies at the bottom of all the evils of which we complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Extortion, traffic in gold, the scarcity and high price of provisions, are mere symptoms of the disease which is consuming the vitals of the <rs>Republic</rs>. --They will never disappear, nor can they be more than temporarily alleviated, until the body financial be &#x0022;purged to its sound and pristine health.&#x0022; Until the volume of the currency be restored to something like a due proportion to the enduring capacity of the country, whose wants it is intended to supply, these evils can no more be eradicated than shoots from the <name>Upas</name> can be prevented from springing up while the main trunk is permitted to retain its position in the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Many propositions for effecting this desirable object have been presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>They are most of them good, and as they are none of them antagonistic, we see no reason why they should not all be tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>But, of all others, the scheme which this paper had the pleasure of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> announcing, but which no person connected with it had the honor of originating, appears to us to be the best, the simplest, and the easiest of execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>We allude, of course, to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan, based upon the same principles with the <rs>National</rs> loan, which saved <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> from bankruptcy at a time when her submersion appeared inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>We have before the country and the world the cotton loan, based upon good security, and commanding the approbation of the most astute financiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Its bonds are offered at <num value="150">150</num>, a great mistake, we think, since they are almost sure to fall below that point in the end, and since it by no means consists with the dignity of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to have their bonds disposed of as a horse jockey disposes of a spavined gelding &mdash; putting a high price upon it, and leaving a wide margin for a fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Since the object is to withdraw as many outstanding Treasury notes as possible from circulation, it would be far better to go into market with them, as we go with other stock, and sell them for what they will bring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>But a Confederate loan, such as that we propose, would dispose of them all at par, for there would be no sales at <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> hand to bring down the price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>In order that this scheme should work effectually, it would be absolutely necessary that the <rs>President</rs> should embrace it heart and soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>As we have said on a former occasion, he has never yet appealed to the people in vain, and there is no reason to believe that the appeal in question would not be as effective as any he has hither to made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Were he to issue his proclamation calling upon all his fellow-citizens to come forward to the assistance of their country, and were that appeal followed up by influential and eloquent citizens in all quarters, there cannot be the shadow of a doubt that the bonds would all be taken up within a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>We trust that he may be induced to try the experiment. </p> </div3>
