<head>The Situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We publish in another column quite an extensive abstract of the news from the <rs>West</rs> and the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>All signed indicate an approaching struggle at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, compared to which all the battles that have yet been fought on this continent are but as so many skirmishes between kites and crows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> Government appears determined to carry that point, imagining, no doubt, that success will open the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and sever <num value="0.5">one half</num> of our empire from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>How widely they are deceived in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> calculation, we took occasion to suggest a day or <num value="2">two</num> ago. <placeName reg="The Mississippi">The Mississippi</placeName> can never be navigated by merchant boats as long as the population on its banks are hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The trade can easily be rendered so dangerous that it will not be attempted; for safe voyages are of the very essence of successful commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>With regard to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proposition, it may be observed that even though <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> be separated from their sisters on this side of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, they constitute an empire, of themselves, full of resources, and inhabited by brave men, who prefer death to the rule of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They have lead, powder, and the means of making it, arms and manufactories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They can of themselves, give the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> a vast deal of trouble, and would at least render the subjugation of the country east of the river a problem as difficult of solution as it now is. All this the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> do not believe, however, but think that if they can take <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> their triumph will be complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Accordingly, the eagles are gathering to the slaughter from all quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> demands a reinforcement of <num value="50000">50,000</num> men. He has already, in a great measure, stripped <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, and that General has been compelled to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The great battle can be delayed but a few days, and if it result in our favor, it will have been the most important event of the war. We repeat what we said yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We have no fears for <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We do not believe that she was ever built to be taken by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If there be food enough to sustain the garrison and population we do not believe that she can be carried by storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We put our trust, under Heaven, in <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> and his brave garrison &mdash; in <persName n="Johnston,,Joe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Johnston,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and his glorious army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is true that <placeName key="tgn,7017544" n="1.000 2309" reg="port hudson, east baton rouge, louisiana">Port Hudson</placeName> may be evacuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But this is a trifle, since the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> hold the mouth of the <placeName reg="Natchitoches, Natchitoches, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014191">Red river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It may be evacuated, we say, but it will never be taken by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> Let our friends keep up their spirits and never despair of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> until they hear of its fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is impossible that <persName n="Johnston,,Joe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Johnston,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> should not have a part, and a very important part, in the approaching grand struggle, and <persName n="Johnston,,Joe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Johnston,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> is not the man to let such a place as <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> fall, without a vigorous effort for its relief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The news from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, although everybody was on the lookout for it, had a most cheering effect upon the spirits of our community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The telegram of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is short, almost to the point of unintelligibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Passengers by the cars say that <num value="6000">6,000</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were taken prisoners; but as this is not confirmed officially, we place no confidence in it. It is a glorious affair, however, and will be considered still more glorious if <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName> can be captured and hung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>That scoundrel has been earning his portion of the gallows for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, and it were most desirable that he should be paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>What may be the future movements of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, we cannot imagine, nor even if we know <hi rend="italics">positively</hi> would we give a hint that might betray the cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> There can be no longer any doubt that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have entirely evacuated <placeName reg="Stafford, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2114347">Stafford</placeName>, part of them having gone to Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, and part up the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>What the movements of our own troops may be in consequence, we neither know nor should tell if we did know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is sufficient for us to know that they are watched by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and that they are not very apt to escape his vigilance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> In the horrible tragedy enacted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, and consisting in the deliberate drowning of <num value="43">43</num> unhappy negroes, to prevent the necessity of going into quarantine, we have a striking comment upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> character, upon their conduct of the war, and upon their sympathy for the slave <rs>Chase</rs>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, spoke the truth for once, when he said they loved not the negro, but they hated his master. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> If all negrodom had <num value="1">one</num> head to morrow, they would rejoice in cutting it off. To characterize this dead as infernal, were to use too mild a term for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It was more horrible than that perpetrated by <persName n="Pelissier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Pelissier,nomatch:0"><surname>Pelissier</surname></persName>, when he smoked <num value="500">500</num> Arabs &mdash; men, women, and children &mdash; to death in a cave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It cannot be that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will smile on a cause upheld by such horrible atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It makes our blood curdle to think of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, it seems, is determined to run again, and the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> is determined to support him. There is a baseness about old <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> that exceeds the aggregate badness of the whole universe.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> news is unimportant.

<head>Defence against <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raids.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> In addition to military organizations for the protection of the fruits of the soil from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raids, it has been suggested that pits might be constructed &mdash; as in some parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> during war, and in this country during the war of the <name>Revolution</name> &mdash; in which to deposigrain, and thereby increase its security against the depredations of the barbarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> familiar with the manner of constructing these pits, or who can devise any other means of protecting the staff of life, would do well to lay the facts before the public. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> An additional measure of defence would be <num value="1">one</num> of aggression, for these cavalry raids are a game at which <num value="2">two</num> can play, and the <rs>South</rs> with much better prospect of success than the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In the first place, the <rs>Confederates</rs> are better horsemen, and we can place a large body of infantry on horseback, without the previous training which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> requires before he can manage a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In the next place, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> territory affords a much more productive field for cavalry raids than the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Here, from the sparseness of the population, cavalry must travel a long distance, and exhaust their supplies, before doing any heavy amount of damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>There, the swarming towns and farm houses would yield a rush return in a short time and small distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If the <rs>Government</rs> will increase our cavalry force, and adopt extensively the policy of cavalry raids, we shall annoy the enemy unit more by this protest engine of mischief than he can do.
