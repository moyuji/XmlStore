<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The earlier the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>To know as soon as possible what is to be the result of the latest attempt to get possession of this city, is the desire of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Indeed it is the only way to save the city, to meet the enemy and frustrate his schemes, which all understand to be to invest <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and take it by gradual approaches. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> There could be no more agreeable news to every person in this city, and, we are sure, to the citizens of the <rs>South</rs> everywhere, than that of a great battle raging near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>All have confidence in the <rs>Southern</rs> troops &mdash; all believe that when they meet the invaders of our soil they will repel them as the firm rock does the wave that beats in vain against it. Let them but meet the foe who has marched into our country to desolate our homes and rob us of our property &mdash; nay, to commit the most horrid of outrages &mdash; and they will rush upon him with a bravery and determination that he will be utterly unable to withstand &mdash; They fight for their country's rights and honor, and in defence of the women and children of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>They will defend them or die.--There is nothing so disheartening to those gallant sons of the <rs>South</rs> as to be ordered to <q>&#x0022;fall back,&#x0022;</q> as it is called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>They advance with avidity and joy &mdash; they retreat with heavy hearts and deep mortification. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> We trust that they are not to be compelled to pursue the retrograde any more, but that, brave patriots as they are, they will be ordered to do what is to them most agreeable of all things. --to meet and drive back the enemy.--If the soldier is gratified, the fields near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> will be our <placeName key="tgn,2070420" n="1.000 3" reg="marathon, cortland, new york">Marathon</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> To surrender <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would entail consequences that we fear to look at. They may be too disastrous to contemplate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>We have an abiding faith in our people, and believe they would continue faithful to the end, but nevertheless it is too plain that the handing over the metropolis to the enemy would bring upon us embarrassments so great that rather than place the <rs>State</rs> in such an exigency as that, we should fight before <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> as though all were lost if we were defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>We have the most confident belief that there will be such fighting, that we shall triumph, and that <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> will be finally saved from the enemy; for if he cannot take her now, with all his means, he never can. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/> Under the heading of <q>&#x0022;The truth about <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> a late number of the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="spa">Courier des Etate Unis</foreign></hi> says that nothing is more common than to talk about the situation of <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>, but nothing is more rare than to discuss the subject with reasonable knowledge of the facts.--People are accustomed to consider not so much the <rs>Government</rs> of <persName n="Juarez,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><surname>Juarez</surname></persName> as the word that serves him for a battle cry; and because the <rs>President</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> and his satellites call themselves Liberals, people willingly believe that liberalism is at stake in the dispute that is a son to be decided in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Thinking it time that such an error should cease, and that the factiousness who have too long desolated the <rs>Spanish Republic</rs> should be restored to their true colors, without regard to the name which they have seen fit to appropriate, the editor of the <hi rend="italics">Courier</hi> copies an ably written letter from <placeName reg="Vera Cruz, Douglas, Missouri" key="tgn,2744101">Vera Cruz</placeName> to the <rs>Paris</rs> <hi rend="italics">Journal des Debate,</hi> setting forth <q>&#x0022;the real situation of <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>, exposing the contemptible adventurers who fatten off of her, and stating the legitimate aspirations of the mass of the population.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/> The writer of this letter says that there is neither Liberal, nor clerical or reactionary party in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>There are simply audacious robbers, without scrapples of any kind on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and victims well-used to the yoke and pretty nearly resigned to their wretched fate on the other hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The population of <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> is not <num value="8000000">8,000,000</num> as is generally believed, but only <num value="6000000">six millions</num>, composed of <num value="5400000">5,400,000</num> pure or half-breed <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> and <num value="600000">600,000</num> white men whose blood is more or less mixed with <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> and negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> are so sunk in ignorance that in some parts they believe themselves to be still subject to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>A few <num value="1000">thousand</num> of them drawn away from their labors by the civil wars take an active part in the disastrous struggles which are waged for the benefit of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> knaves, half of whom call themselves Liberals, and the other half Reactionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>All the rest of the population, the real people, desire only to work and live in peace in this country, which would be great in a few years under a true Government; for poverty is rare, and it would be altogether unknown if there was only a better security for person and property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/> The <num value="2">two</num> parties divide the <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexicans</rs>, properly so called, pretty equally, the greater part of them affecting political passions far enough from their real sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>This is easily enough understood when it is taken into consideration that to belong to the defeated party is to furnish a warrant of spoliation, which the poor victim rarely escapes, often even suffering death; and <num value="1">one</num> runs the same risks in his own party, if he should be suspected of any moderation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>These people steal from Governments as well as from individuals, as witness the <measure n="40000dollars" type="currency">$40,000</measure> belonging to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> stolen by the <rs>Juarez Government</rs> from the bank of <persName n="Penand,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00275" reg="default:Penand,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Penand</surname></persName>, where the money was deposited, and the <measure n="630000dollars" type="currency">$630,000</measure> stolen by <persName n="Miramon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00276" reg="mostcommon:Miramon,nomatch:0"><surname>Miramon</surname></persName> from the <rs>English Legation</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>There is some difference in the amounts stolen, it is true, but the only difference between the thieves is the regret on the part of <persName n="Juarez,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><surname>Juarez</surname></persName> that he could not steal as much as his antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/> The only thing organized in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> is highway robbery.
