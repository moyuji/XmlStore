<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> It has been objected to this bill that it does not provide for the future support and maintenance of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>This is, we think, a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">second section</orgName> seems devoted entirely to that object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="4Section">fourth sections</orgName> certainly <hi rend="italics">read</hi> as though they would effect the object of retiring the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Yet we have seen, in former times, the heaviest penalties fall to drive notes for sums under <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> out of circulation at times when specie payment was suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The very exception in their favor, when a Government debt is to be extinguished, will, we fear, keep up their currency in spite of penalties and prohibitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Their convenience as change will tend still further to prolong their life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Nevertheless, this bill is evidently the work of a man who has thoroughly studied the subject and is master of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> All the schemes which we have yet seen propose to fund the debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>This is, with us, a radical objection to them all, as we have often taken occasion to observe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>But as it does not seem probable that any plan on which this feature shall not be engrafted is likely to be adopted at present, we shall content ourselves with choosing from the crowd of plans embracing it. Perhaps something better than anything yet proposed might be obtained by selecting the best suggestions of the various plans and compounding an entirely new <num value="1">one</num> out of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>In the meantime this bill of <persName n="Lyons,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00306" reg="mostcommon:Lyons,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyons</surname></persName> is well worthy of a careful study. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The proceedings of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> These proceedings must be of more interest than we were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> disposed to ascribe to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>We judge so from the circumstance of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> seizing the occasion to bully the <rs>Congress</rs> in advance, fearful, no doubt, that the infection may spread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> attempts at once to put rings in the noses of <persName n="Wood,,Fernando,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00307" reg="default:Wood,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> and his <num value="59">fifty-nine</num>, and bits in their mouths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>It evidently sees symptoms of a much more widely spread disaffection than it is willing to allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>It will not believe that there are <num value="59">fifty-nine</num> persons in Congress willing to enter into conference with &#x0022;<persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00308" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>&#x0022; on terms of equality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> These proceedings, whatever impression they may make upon persons outside of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, are perfectly well understood there, at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>They form a part of the armory from which weapons are to be drawn in the approaching Presidential campaign.--They are the thunderbolts of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>That party no more desire peace on the condition of eternal separation than the <name>Abolitionists</name> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Their object is, by proposing terms which they know will not be accepted, to get, with the people, the credit of having done all in the power of man to put an end to the war, which the large majority would gladly see stopped, provided peace should bring re-union with it. At the same time they know this proposition will be rejected by the majority of Congress, who are determined to push the war to subjugation or extermination.--Should it even be accepted, they know that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would reject any proposition so much as intimating re-union with scorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>They are, therefore, perfectly safe in making these movements, which are merely designed to restore them to power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Once in power, they would prosecute the war as fiercely as the <name>Abolitionists</name> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>They would be compelled to do so by public opinion in Yankeedom, which, however unsettled in other respects, is unanimous in favor of fighting until all the territory claimed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> shall have been once more brought under the &#x0022;gridiron.&#x0022; With these squabbles of parties in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress we have not, nor can we possibly have, any interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>They affect us neither <num value="1">one</num> way nor another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>They all imply a continuance of the war upon the largest scale, unless we prefer re-union, which we do not, and never will. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>In calling in a foreign enemy to assist them in their struggles with their fellow-citizens, the <rs>Union</rs> men of that unhappy country find that they have brought in a master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Theirs is the history of every people who have made a similar experiment, from the day when the <name>Druids</name> of ancient <persName n="Gaul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="mostcommon:Gaul,nomatch:0"><surname>Gaul</surname></persName> called in Julins C&#x00E6;sar and his legions to settle a political dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The arbiter always ends by becoming the master of both parties and of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is now groaning beneath a most intolerable tyranny, and when <num value="1">one</num> of her representatives endeavors to obtain from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress a declaration that she is still a State, her masters will not hear of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>So far as the <rs>Union</rs> people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> are concerned, we glory in this retribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>They loved their mule contracts and their fat cattle better than the honor of their State, and they have their reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>But we feel, and feel most acutely, for the nobler and better portion of that State, who have been betrayed, persecuted, impoverished, and in <num value="1000">thousands</num> of cases driven into exile, by the assistance of those who sacrificed the honor of the <rs>State</rs> to gratuity <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> malice, and now complain that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have given them exactly the treatment they might have expected had their souls been alive to a single generous emotion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/> Upon the whole, we are not sorry to see the vote upon <persName n="Harding,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="mostcommon:Harding,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harding</surname></persName>'s motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It dissolves every shadow of illusion which may have previously existed with regard to the intentions of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government.--They mean to subjugate or exterminate us; that is plain, and we must make up our minds to be neither exterminated nor subjugated. </p> </div3>
