<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Their mode of escape was by removing some bricks from under the sill of the door to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story of the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Running in a line with the floor of this story is a wide platform, on which a sentinel is constantly posted; and when we consider that their means of egress was so near the guardsman as to almost scrape his feet, it does not speak well for his vigilance that the enterprise was so successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>A prisoner in the same room with those who escaped, also a deserter from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army, and for a long time in the old U.

With a pencil he wrote on an envelope the arrangements which were being made, and threw it out of the window on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, so that the sentinel might pick it up; but he failed to discover it till the number specified above had already gotten out. As soon as the envelope was found and its contents made known, which was about <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>. <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the alarm was given, and soldiers were sent in every direction in search of the refugees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Had not the plot been discovered at the time it was, there is very little doubt that before morning all the prisoners confined in the building would have escaped.--After the discovery was made known to the officers of the prison, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who failed to make their escape became so incensed against the informant that it was found necessary to remove him to another apartment in order to protect him from their indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Up to a late hour last night <num value="2">two</num> of the runaways had been captured and brought back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The bars to the prison window had been bent open, and by this means room enough was made for a man's body to pass through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Constant vigilance is essentially necessary in taking care of such a large number of prisoners as are now confined in this city. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>He was still of the opinion that Berile's intention was to make good the <measure n="15boxes" type="mass">fifteen boxes</measure> of tin which he had offered to exchange. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> We feel perfectly confident in the belief that the despondency which to a certain extent has lately spread over the country is due, in a great degree, to the murmuring of those who have been subjected to the operation of the conscription by the repeal of the substitute laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Those gentlemen who, in the prime of life, with all their limbs sound and intact, with their bodily condition in a state of perfect health, strong, and active, who thought themselves secured from accident by shot and shell under cover of their substitutes, have found themselves mistaken, and there is no end to their lamentations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Of course, the country must be gone to the dogs since <hi rend="italics">they</hi> are called upon to fight for it. What more terrible calamity can befall it than that they should be disturbed in their patriotic occupations of fleecing the public and hoarding up money, to bear arms, like common people, in defence of their lives, their homes, their families, and their firesides?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>As long as the question was left to be decided by others, everything was going on well enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>These patriots see ruin in everything &mdash; even in our very successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The idea of having to shoulder their muskets and face the enemy in person tinges all their contemplations, and causes them to see everything through a veil as murky as the very pit of perdition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>They live in an atmosphere rendered gloomy by their own personal apprehensions, and they fancy that it is the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> atmosphere in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Because everything looks black and gloomy to them, they believe that everything is black and gloomy in very truth. &#x0022;<persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName>,&#x0022; said a gentleman sleeping at an inn to his <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> servant, &#x0022;<persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName>, open the door and see what sort of night it is.&#x0022; &#x0022;Please your honor,&#x0022; answered <persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName>, opening the door of a press and popping his nose upon a huge cheese, &#x0022;Please your honor, it's dark and smells like cheese.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> The discontent, the murmurs, the gloomy views of this class of malcontents have, we verily believe, done more to dispirit this people than all the disasters we have sustained from the beginning of the war to this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Instead of meeting their fortune like men &mdash; instead of being thankful that for nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of unexampled trials, dangers, and hardships, they have enjoyed, by the mere payment of a sum of money, a total exemption from them all &mdash; instead of taking up their muskets like men and doing their duty as every man is called on to do in this day of trial &mdash; a large portion of these people are engaged in no other occupation than that of spreading gloom and discontent around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>And all for what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Because they are called on to serve their country as well as the poor, ragged, hard-fighting veterans of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, to whom they owe it that they have not long ago been stripped of every dollar that they have in the world, and made the servants of their own negroes and the mockery of the white scoundrels with whom they are associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Let us not be understood as embracing in these remarks <hi rend="italics">all</hi> or even the larger portion of the substitute hirers.--Some of them, a large portion, accept their fate with cheerfulness; others, quite a large body, were compelled to procure substitutes by a necessity inferior only in its exactions to absolute duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>We speak of that class, and it is a very large <num value="1">one</num>, which procured substitutes for the purpose of making money out of this war, and of that other class, a larger <num value="1">one</num> still, which procured them merely to keep their own carcasses out of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>These classes it is whose complaints and clamors have had so large a share in depressing the spirits of the people at large. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>We hear enormous boasting of their preparations from the enemy, and we give way to panic just as if they never boasted before, or as if we had not heretofore withstood them in spite of all their braggadocio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Why, when the war was about to open, they were confident of subduing us with <num value="75000">75,000</num> men. <num value="25000">25,000</num> were to march from <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> down the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, <num value="25000">25,000</num> were to land and march on <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and <num value="25000">25,000</num> were to move upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Have we forgotten the pompous descriptions of the iron-clad vessels, and the continued glorifications of Yankeedom's invincible legions, which crowded the columns of all their papers at that remarkable period?
