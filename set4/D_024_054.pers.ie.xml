<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>And this will be done, too, through the duly elected representatives of the <name>States</name> and the people in Congress assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>This most remarkable political revolution is now within a few days of its consummation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> This organic instrument and the laws passed in pursuance thereof constitute the supreme law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Nor do we think it can be successfully denied or contested that in straining its warlike authority to the establishment at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> of a temporary dictatorship, Congress has in the acts indicated passed the barriers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The legislative power of Congress in regard to the militia, in case of rebellion or invasion, and over the financial affairs of the country, and the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> is broad and comprehensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It is possible that with a Napoleon or a Cromwell, clothed with this provisional dictatorship, there would be an end of our <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> institutions and the beginning of an imperial establishment; but there is not the slightest danger of the abuse of his authority by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for ambitious purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We all know that his ambition is limited to the suppression of the rebellion, but if he were not, we all know that he would be powerless to employ the intelligent, liberty loving soldiers of the <rs>Union</rs> in any movement involving the suppression of our regular Presidential election. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> We therefore entertain no apprehensions of evil to the reserved rights of the <name>States</name> or the liberties of the people from these extraordinary powers with which Congress is clothing the <rs>President</rs>.--On the other hand, as these laws will be passed over to the next Administration they may even then be turned to good account in the application of their pains and penalties to the <name>Abolition</name> disorganizes at the <rs>North</rs>, after the rebels of the <rs>South</rs> shall have been reduced to their proper allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Meantime, accepting the plea of imperious necessity, we cheerfully consent to this transformation of our <rs type="role2">President</rs> into a temporary Dictator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>We cheerfully consent, in view of the great object of concentrating the forces and resources of the loyal States against those of the rebellion, and in the belief that this is the shortest way to the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, we cheerfully consent to surrender, for the present some of the privileges, immunities exemptions, and blessings of peace to push on this war, upon which depends the very life of this nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> Upon this point the patriotism of the loyal States is surely equal to that self sacrificing fanaticism which governs the people of the rebellions States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>These people are under the most terrible despotism ever known to modern times; they bear it, they sustain it, and they submit to conscriptions, crucifies, extortions, privations, sufferings, and losses, painful to contemplate, under the belief that all these things are demanded of them in order to secure the independence of their <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and under the belief, too, that with the object secured they will have a better Government, and a new career of happiness, security, and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Are not, then, the people of the loyal States capable of sustaining, it a comparatively light degree the burdens of a struggle upon which not only the life of the <rs>Government</rs>, but the safety of the property, the home, and the household goods of every man in the country depends?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The intelligent will need no prompting to answer this question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> But we concur in these war measures of Congress from still another view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They will admonish the great Powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that foreign intervention against the <rs>Union</rs> is not to be thought of and that they can only intervene in support of the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Thus <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> may, perhaps, be convinced that the time has arrived when, acting upon <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s Congressional peace proposition he may say to <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his Confederates: Further resistance to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is worse than useless &mdash; Accept the friendly offices of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in behalf of your submission to the <rs>Union</rs> or prepare for the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>But in every view of the subject, foreign and domestic, we are prepared to sustain these war measures of Congress and to support the <rs>President</rs> even as a temporary Dictator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> We have often referred to the fact that <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> abolitionism has always derived its most malignant inspirations from <name>English</name> abolitionism; but we were not aware until lately that even the infamous emancipation programme of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had been on <num value="1">one</num> occasion recommended by high literary authority in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, as the most, and indeed the only, effectual way of carrying on war with <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>A friend has put in our hands an article of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Frazer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Frazer,nomatch:0"><surname>Frazer</surname></persName>'s Magazine,</hi> published at the time of the <rs>Canadian</rs> troubles in <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>, when a war between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> seemed imminent, under the title of &#x0022;War with <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> a Blessing to Mankind.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> The writer discusses, in the first place, the ordinary notion of levying war in the old fashioned style, by sending a military and naval expedition against the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>He contends that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> cannot do this with any chance of success, and that she cannot afford a protracted contest with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, because <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> might embrace the opportunity of striking a blow at her ancient enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>After asserting that her bondmen are held in the most cruel thraldom known to mankind, and proving it by the confessions of the &#x0022;<orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName> of the <orgName n="American Anti Slavery Society" type="society">American Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>, &#x0022; the writer proceeds: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> &#x0022;It may be a doubtful point, how far another nation would be justified, in a time of peace, in embarking in a crusade of philanthropy, and endeavoring to coerce an independent people into the relinquishment of a national sin. But what possible doubt can exist as to the propriety, the expediency &mdash; nay, the absolute duty, of making a way subservient to the great and pre eminent object of freeing these <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of cruelly oppressed human beings? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> &#x0022;Policy, too, not less than philanthropy, prescribes such a course of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>By this mode, and this only, a war with <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> might be brought to a speedy and inevitably triumphant close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>As we have already observed, a struggle between the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and their descendants in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> must be a fearless, a protracted, and a lamentable <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>But if assailed in this quarter, a vital part is instantly and surely reached &mdash; the <rs>Union</rs> dissolved, and the war is at an end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> &#x0022;Among the <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of slaves, we may fairly calculate the adult males at nearly <hi rend="italics"><num value="1000000">one million</num>.</hi> Every man of all this multitude would eagerly rush to embrace an emancipating invader, and within a few days' sail of their coast repose the free and happy black of <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>In <num value="1">one</num> morning a force of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men might be raised in this quarter, for the enfranchisement of their brethren in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Such a force, supported by <num value="2">two</num> battalions of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> and supplied with <num value="20000">20,000</num> muskets would establish themselves in <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>, never to be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>In <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> from their appearance the entire <rs>South</rs> would be in <num value="1">one</num> conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The chains of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men would be broken, and by what power could they ever be again riveted? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> &#x0022;We say that this course is dictated alike by policy, by self-preservation, and by philanthropy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>By policy, for nothing would render our possessions in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> so secure as the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.--an inevitable result of this line of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>By self- preservation for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> must not venture amidst her other difficulties, to involve herself in a protracted contest <unclear></unclear> a distant quarter of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>By philanthropy which tells us that if, contrary to our own inclinations, we are dragged into this unnatural war, it is our duty at least to endeavor to bring good out of evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>In whatever way, then, we contemplate the subject, we come to this conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/><hi rend="italics">If we must have a war with <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, let us make it a war for the emancipation of the slaves; so shall our success be certain, and our triumph the triumph of humanity.</hi>&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>They border on the marvellous; yet they are strictly authentic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>He began with a small body of horse, which he raises himself, and during his career has brought from within the lines of the enemy, and turned over to the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, nearly <num value="5000">5,000</num> men. He has generally been at the head of less than <num value="1000">1,000</num> men &mdash; in his famous raid on <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> he started with <num value="875">875</num> and returned with <num value="1200">1,200</num>.

His expeditions have always been of the most daring description; yet, he has never, but on <num value="2">two</num> occasions, been forced to fight when he did not wish it. Many of his battles have been of the most desperate character, and he has been uniformly victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>He has frequently operated hundreds of miles from support, in the midst of overwhelming bodies of the enemy, whose strength was greatly enhanced by the possession of railroads and telegraphs, stretching around him like a web, and almost indefinitely facilitating their power of concentration, while, in the same degree, it complicated the dangers of his situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The sagacity with which he has always been enabled to pluck triumph from the very fews of these multiplied dangers, indicates the great leader, not only of partizan corps, but of regular armies. </p>
