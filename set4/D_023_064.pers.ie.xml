<head>From our army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Our latest news from the army, through private sources, is to <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last, which is derived from parties who left <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName> on that day. Up to that time our army was bivouacked around that city, but marching orders had been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The direction contemplated was not understood by our informants, though it was conjectured that our forces would move on the <rs>Relay</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Others state that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the army, or a large portion of it, moved in the direction of <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> These parties state that our soldiers were receiving every attention from the people of <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName> and the neighborhood, and articles were sold them at rates that seemed admonishingly low, compared with the high prices they have had to pay in Virginia At <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName>, hundreds of soldiers purchased shoes at <measure n="2.50dollars" type="currency">$2.50</measure> to <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure>. and other articles of clothing at proportionate rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Coffee was bought by them in great abundance at <measure n="25cents" type="currency">25 cents</measure> per pound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> A recruiting office was opened in <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName> immediately after our army took possession of the city, and the <name>Stars</name> and Bars were flung to the <unclear></unclear>. Up to the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> inst, about <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> gallant Marylanders, from <placeName reg="Frederick, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,7016101">Frederick</placeName> and <placeName reg="Montgomery, Maryland, Maryland" key="tgn,7016104">Montgomery counties</placeName>, had enrolled themselves in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The condition of the army is said to be excellent and the spirits of the men buoyant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The universal desire of the soldiers was to move on <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, with a view to have an opportunity to visit some of the effects of war upon those who have been clamorous for the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The conduct of our man at <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName> had greatly strengthened feeling in our favor in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and it was believed that the <name>Unionism</name> which has heretofore existed in the <rs>State</rs> would materially subside in that part of it occupied by our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This Unionism has not manifested itself in any offensive form since our forces crossed the <rs>Potomac</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Passengers by the <rs>Central</rs> train state that a rumor prevailed at <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> that a body of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry were advancing from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, in the direction of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>; but this rumor was of so indefinite a character that little attention was given to it. It is by no means unlikely that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raids will be attempted, but we presume the wisdom and prudence of our military authorities have made ample preparation for such contingencies. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>At that place they out port holes in nearly every house, declaring their intention to make a stand against the rebel forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>So suddenly did they leave on bearing of the approach of our troops that a number of Union men who were preparing to leave with them were left behind to fall into the hands of our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The whole of the <rs type="place">Greenbrier Valley</rs> has been evacuated, the enemy moving in the direction of the <rs type="place">Kanawha Valley</rs>. </p>

<head>Meeting of the <name>Legislature</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> The <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName>, in response to the call of the <rs>Governor</rs>, meets again to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>We welcome it to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> with pleasure, for it is a body whose more than <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs>, whose <hi rend="smallcaps"><rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs></hi> firmness has saved the capital, and headed by a patriotic Governor, who so nobly and energetically co-operated with them in nailing the flag of the old line-of-battle ship to the mast, rescued the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> from the ruin and ignominy which at <num value="1">one</num> time threatened to overwhelm her. The Legislature is now called upon to consider a subject of vital importance, the supply of salt, and to adopt measures, by contracts and charters, and such other means as the emergency may require, to procure an adequate supply of an article as essential as munitions of war to the welfare of the <rs>State</rs>.--Whatever is to be done on this subject, must be done quickly, for the season is close at hand when salt must be obtained, or great loss and injury will be inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>We hope that the <name>Legislature</name> will maintain the reputation it has already achieved for prompt and energetic action, and that no time will be lost in clap-trap harangues or Buncombe speeches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>On other occasions, the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> could afford to lose time in talk, but what we want now is action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Let salt, not gas, be the watchword. </p> </div3>

<head>A law for Keeping up stock.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> Among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> measures demanded of the <name>Legislature</name>, for the relief of a community suffering the bitter results of invasion, is a law requiring every farmer to keep up his own stock, so as to prevent them from trespassing on the farms of others.--Wherever the contending armies have marched, the fencing of the country, and, in many cases, even the timber, has been completely swept away, so that the farmers are left without any means of securing their crops, unless some such measure as that we have indicated be made the law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Even where the timber itself has been spared by the devastating legions there is neither time nor plans now to prepare fencing, so that there is no other remedy but to require all who have stock to pen it up. Those who are not able to do this, would better sell their stock, than that the land should become a desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The Legislature cannot take too early action on this subject. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
