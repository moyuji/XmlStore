<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> &#x0022;Fools alone,&#x0022; says <persName><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <genName n="1">I</genName></persName>., &#x0022;judge of the wisdom of measures by the result.&#x0022; It needs but little reflection, and a slight acquaintance with mankind to convince us of the truth of this maxim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The wisest measures, the most carefully digested plane, are often thwarted when on the point of success, by some unforeseen incident of the most trivial importance, some accident which never could have entered into human calculation some mistake of some agent, which it was impossible to foresees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Is the conception to be condemned as ridiculous because of the failure in the execution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>so say the class of persons to whom <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> alludes, and so say the majority of the world, who take their opinions ready made, and never give themselves the trouble of thinking. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Of all other plans which are subject to this description of criticism, military plans are those which are most apt to be judged by the result, because, of all others, they are the most exposed to the caprice of fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>A campaign projected with the most profound wisdom, and having for its and the most important objects, may fail, while another conceived in folly and executed against all the rules of military science may succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In such cases the public never fail to set down the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as an enterprise of such a nature that it could have succeeded in no possible combination of circumstances, while they always applaud the last as the perfection of wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The little fortress of Bard &mdash; so insignificant that it was entirely overlooked in the plan of campaign &mdash; was near baffling <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in his advance upon <placeName key="tgn,2059733" n="1.000 4" reg="milan, sullivan, missouri">Milan</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, and shutting up his army in the narrow <placeName reg="Valley of Aosta">Valley of Aosta</placeName>, to be destroyed at leisure by the <name>Austrians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The sagacity of a peasant, by conducting the corps of the <name>Prussian</name> <persName n="Bulow,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Bulow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bulow</surname></persName> along the road that led immediately to the flank and rear of the <rs>French</rs> army when several others presented themselves, saved the <rs>English</rs> army from utter destruction at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Clark, Missouri" key="tgn,2753452">Waterloo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>If, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, the unforeseen obstacle had caused the failure of the enterprise, the class of persons who judge of merit only by success would have pronounced <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> a rash and indiscreet General, who has undertaken an enterprise above his strength and failed, as he ought to have known that he <hi rend="italics">must</hi> fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In the last mentioned case he actually is condemned in almost these very terms, because <persName n="Bulow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bulow,nomatch:0"><surname>Bulow</surname></persName> chanced to meet with a guide possessing above the average intelligence of Flemish peasants, although his plan of campaign was fraught with the most consummate wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Some spring or wheel of the very complicated machinery with which the campaign against <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>, terminating in his surrender at <placeName reg="York, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014650">York</placeName>, was worked, might have jarred &mdash; and in order to ensure success it was necessary that every part of it should do its work faithfully &mdash; and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> might have failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Then, most assuredly, he and his plan would have been denounced by this class of persons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> We have been led into these reflections by the comments which we hear made every day upon the campaign of <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>To our mind it was <num value="1">one</num> of the wisest, grandest, and most imposing schemes ever conceived by the mind of man. It proposed to force the <rs>Federal</rs> army into a battle, the stake of which was <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> the whole of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>; and the recognition of our existence as a separate nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>To succeed, the most ample means, as it was believed, were prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He was at the head of an army that had never been beaten, and he was opposed to an army that had never been victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>According to all rational calculation success was certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Yet, from <num value="1">one</num> of those accidents which are so common in war &mdash; from the failure of a division that had never failed before &mdash; he did not succeed to the full extent of public expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>instantly all the foots, who judge by results, cried out that the scheme was impracticable; and that the attempt to carry it out indicated a hardihood and desperation that ill became the commander of the chief <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.-- Had he succeeded, as he would have done but for an accident past the power of human sagacity to foresee, these very men would have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to extol his wise foresight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Persons of this description are unable to see any advantage that has been derived from the invasion of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The immense stores, of every kind, which we captured; the relief to our own overburdened land by the transfer of the war to the country of the enemy; the terror with which the whole <rs>North</rs> was struck, as by a thunderbolt the moral advantage obtained by proving to the enemy that his dominions were open to invasion; all these pass for nothing with these people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But they fortunately do not pass for nothing with the enemy, who sees and appreciates them all at their full value. </p> </div3>

<head>Adversity the test of fortitude.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The reverses brought upon us should be accepted as the test of our fortitude and our strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Heretofore our greatest achievements have followed close upon our most embarrassing situations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Difficulties and perils have never yet failed to bring out the true spirit and energy of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Nor will they fail us now. Before the summer's campaign is concluded we shall have encouraging news to slate the confident and cheer the desponding. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> It is not in the nature of most men and nations to be proof against the bad effects of prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They are too apt to be deluded into a sense of security and self sufficiency that, if persevered in, must prove fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The Southern arms had been crowned with a series of triumphs of the most brilliant character.-- The army and the people had adopted the idea of invincibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Whether this led to ill-advised movements or not on the part of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> we are not able to say; but it had certainly imparted to the public mind a feeling of safety that has been rather rudely disturbed by recent events. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> In quick succession we have had the drawn <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> and the retreat of <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to the <rs>Potomac</rs>-- the surrender of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and the capture of <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,John,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s expedition in <placeName key="tgn,7007706" n="1.000 4" reg="ohio">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Our armies in the <rs>Southwest</rs> have been, with small exception, inactive, while the enemy has reduced the <num value="2">two</num> garrisons on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, by which some <num value="35000">35,000</num> or <num value="40000">40,000</num> men have been lost to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Why there was not some concentration of our forces under <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But there was not, and the enemy having achieved <num value="1">one</num> great labor finds himself free to move where he thinks best, forcing upon our troops activity at last to elude him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> These events create anxiety in the public mind; but if the <rs>South</rs> is only true to the character it has thus far exhibited, they will arouse it to a more determined resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is well, if these reverses were to come, that they have followed so soon our own triumphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The nation had not time to relapse so deeply late apathy as to put it beyond recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If it slept at all, it was on the <unclear></unclear> and <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> will meet the enemy and repulse him just when he fancies that he has again crushed the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We do not believe that he has been or will be captured.
