<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> This question of consuls and other foreign public functionaries, being recognized as such in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, in very justly invoking criticism and censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>These foreign representatives were not accredited as such to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>We have sent representatives to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, proffering to treat with them, and asking the rights and immunities of nations; our proffers have been refused, and that in a manner which should justly challenge the displeasure of our Government and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>They are allowing the plainest terms of the <rs>Paris</rs> treaty to be violated by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--a party to said treaty &mdash; in allowing the blockade of our ports, which said blockade in no wise meets the demands of said treaty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/> They are thus stultifying themselves before the civilized world, and doing us the grossest injustice as a nation and as a people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> Our magnanimity has been quite beyond that spirit of national honor and independence, which every nation must exhibit to be respected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> At all our seaport cities are to be found consuls and other public functionaries, representing different <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Governments.--The people will demand that we exhibit some self respect, and that these cease their functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> have not chosen to know such a Government as the <rs>Confederates States</rs>, in which they have many public functionaries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> We demand as a right that these functionaries be informed that we know no such powers as they purport to represent, and that none of their acts as such will be recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>The plainest rules of common sense will at once endorse this position as the only <num value="1">one</num> that we, as a nation, can adopt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> We hear of the <rs>English Consul</rs>, the <rs>French Consul</rs>, the <rs>Spanish Consul</rs>, and many others, doing this and that at different points of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; issuing passports, protecting property etc., etc. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/> How came they to be appointed to the discharge of these functions within these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>We answer that they were never so appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>They were accredited as such to those posts and localities whilst we were a part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> We have absolved ourselves from the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, but still we allow a portion of her machinery to perform her functions within our borders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/> It may be answered that these are not functionaries of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> This does not change the obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>We have sent to the powers thus represented among us, or the most of them, and proposed to treat with them as a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>They have rejected our proffer; therefore, the instincts of honor, year, even of the commonest principles of right, demand of us enough self-respect to say to these functionaries that you cannot longs be recognized as such &mdash; This will induce those Governments at once to discover what is at least their interest, if not duty, and that will be to recognize our Government by sending ministers and consuls to represent them and their subjects upon our soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/> Complications are already arising which is an argument in support of the views advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Questions have arisen between our military authorities and some of these foreign representatives, and in <num value="1">one</num> case, if not more, <num value="1">one</num> of these representatives has said he must appeal to the <rs>Minister</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for a decision in the premises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> We call upon our Congress to take hold of this question, and place our country and people upon terms just and honorable to them, by knowing no Government or representative of a Government which does not reciprocate this knowledge and representation. </p> <closer> <signed>Confederacy</signed> </closer> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
