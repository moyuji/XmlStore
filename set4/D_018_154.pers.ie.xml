<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>That portion of the fort above the water line is of brick and concrete of the most solid character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> It is mounted with the heaviest guns of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> service, arranged in <num value="3">three</num> tiers, the <num value="2">two</num> lower being Casemates and the upper Barbette guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The armament consists of <num value="140">140</num> pieces, placed in the following order: The heaviest guns, such as the <num value="32">32</num> and <num value="64">64</num>-pounders, on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tier; <num value="24">24</num> and <num value="32">32</num>-pounders on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> tier; Columbiads (<num value="8">8</num> and <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10 inch</measure>) and heavy sea-coast mortars on the top of the ramparts. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>They deem it unnecessary and out of place to avow sentiments of loyalty to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and devotion to the <rs>Union</rs> of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>A reference to the part the <rs>State</rs> has acted in the past will furnish the best evidence of the feeling of her sons in regard to the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> and the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which is the sole bond which binds them together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that a Union long established should not be dissolved for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience, but more especially the course pursued by the <rs>Southern States</rs>, bath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing that to which they are accustomed, and which they have regarded as the &#x0022;palladium of their political safety and prosperity.&#x0022; But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, on the part of the <rs>North</rs> towards the <rs>South</rs>, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design on the part of the <rs>North</rs> to reduce the <rs>South</rs> to absolute submission, it is the right it is the duty of the <rs>South</rs> to dissolve such a Union, and to provide new guards for their future security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Such has been the patient sufferance of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and such is now the necessity which, in our judgment, constrains them to cover that Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The history of the present Union, for years past, is a history of unremitting injuries and usurpations to the <rs>Southern States</rs>, among which appears no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest, but all have in direct object the extermination of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and thereby the establishment of an absolute tyranny of a national <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> majority of <num value="1">one</num> portion of this Union over the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Whilst <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName></hi> was building that fort, and it was in a condition so unfinished and weak that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> General declared that it was no better than &#x0022;a slaughter pen,&#x0022; a powerful <orgName n="British fleet" type="fleet">British fleet</orgName> attacked it, and was most triumphantly driven off, with <num value="1">one</num> ship entirely lost, <num value="2">two</num> others so riddled as to become almost wrecks, and <num value="222">two hundred and twenty-two</num> men killed and wounded, while the fortress was hardly injured by the fire of the <orgName n="British squadron" type="squadron">British squadron</orgName>, and when the battle was over, every gun but <num value="1">one</num> was still in position Only <num value="11">eleven</num> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinian</rs> were killed and <measure n="26" type="wounded">twenty-six wounded</measure>. This is the uniform history, almost without exception, of contests between ships and forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In a late article in <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Blackwood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="mostcommon:Blackwood,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackwood</surname></persName>'s Magazine</hi> on the subject of &#x0022;<term type="ship">Iron-clad</term> <rs type="ship">Ships</rs>,&#x0022; it is stated that every assault of <name>British</name> squadrons upon <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> forts in the <name>Crimean</name> wars was successfully repulsed, and this notwithstanding the weight of metal was in favor of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>In <num value="1">one</num> case, a British steam-frigate, carrying more than <num value="30">thirty</num> heavy guns, was knocked to pieces and forced to surrender by a trumpery <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00264" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> battery of only <num value="4">four</num> guns, with a furnace for heating shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The <rs>French</rs> did not even attempt to employ their ships against the <rs>Russian</rs> forts, but actually built earthworks on the shore to protect the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>In our own wars with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, repeated instances of a similar kind have occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>At <placeName reg="Stonington, New London, Connecticut" key="tgn,2017438">Stonington, Connecticut</placeName>, in the late war, a single cannon drove off a <orgName n="British squadron" type="squadron">British squadron</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Such facts as these have led the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> to introduce &#x0022;iron sheathing&#x0022; for vessels, which was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tried upon gunboats, and, in the assault upon Kinburn, proved completely successful, protecting the ships from the shot of the forts, and compelling the latter, after a short and furious cannonade, to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Since that time, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00265" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> has applied this defensive armor to large frigates, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experiment being the <name>Gloire</name>, which was so entirely successful that he has built a number of those upon the same plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The <rs>English</rs> have been compelled, at heavy cost, to imitate his example; for, if all accounts of the <hi rend="italics">Gloire</hi> be true, a dozen such vessels could become masters of the channel at any time it pleased their Imperial master to give the command, and then, with a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num> <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs> thrown upon the <rs>British</rs> coast, the memory of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName> and the existence of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would be wiped out together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>With such means of aggression in <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s</hi> hand, the <rs>English Government</rs> &mdash; which is already piling up the taxes to an intolerable amount &mdash; will be forced to construct almost an entirely new navy, or trust to the forbearance of their powerful ally, who, thus far, it must be conceded, seems to be just and merciful to his apprehensive comrade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> The relative merits of forts and ships, when brought into collision, are not without interest at the present time in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>There are no iron-clad ships in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Navy, and none others can be depended upon to silence the guns of any respectable fortification. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> have committed no violence &mdash; only declared themselves independent of the <rs>Union</rs>, and in their mode of proceeding they have behaved better and more sensibly than the <name>Pittsburgers</name> are disposed to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Nevertheless, we do not hear any clamors from the <rs>South</rs> for coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/> As the organs of the <rs n="Sardinian" type="ethnic">Sardinian</rs> Government in the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> press have very recently called the attention of their readers to the proposed plan of investing &#x0022;The <rs type="place">Leonine City</rs>&#x0022; with a neutral character, and of rendering it the future seat of the <rs>Pope</rs>'s restricted sovereignty &mdash; as the renewal of these discussions and recommendations somewhat significantly coincides with reports of the attempted renewal of negotiations between the <rs>Courts</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe">Turin</placeName> and of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> &mdash; it may perhaps prove neither inexpedient nor uninteresting to examine more closely this proposed solution, and to state what is strictly meant under the term &#x0022;the <rs type="place">Leonine City</rs>.&#x0022; &#x0022;The <rs type="place">Leonine City</rs>&#x0022; is that part of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> which <persName n="Leo,Pope,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00553" reg="mostcommon:Leo,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Pope">Pope</roleName> <surname>Leo</surname></persName> <num value="4">IV</num>., carrying out the design of <persName><foreName>Leo</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>., surrounded with walls, in the period from <num value="848">848</num> to <num value="852">852</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>On the <date value="06-28">28th of June</date> (in the last of these years) <persName><foreName>Leo</foreName> <genName n="4">IV</genName></persName>., attended by all his clergy, made a solemn progress along the whole extent of the newly erected walls, and blessed the completed work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The boundary line of the &#x0022;<placeName reg="Leonine City">Leonine City</placeName>,&#x0022; as thus traced out, began at the ditch of the <rs type="place">Castle of St. Angelo</rs>, and stretched from thence to the site of the present Papal Palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>It ascended the hill at the point where there is now &#x0022;the <name>Mint</name>,&#x0022; and after reaching the summit took a westerly direction, ending at that part on the bank of the <name>Tiber</name> where now stands the <rs type="place">Hospital of Santo Spirito</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The entire &#x0022;<placeName reg="Leonine City">Leonine City</placeName>&#x0022; was thus enclosed by a wall <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> miles in circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Down to the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> century the boundary wall had suffered very little change, and there is still standing <num value="1">one</num> part, with its <num value="3">three</num> towers, in the <rs>Papal Garden</rs>, whilst another part has been preserved near the <rs>Porta Cavelleggeri</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>But the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Senate in the middle ages, and Popes <persName><foreName>Paul</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>., Plus <num value="4">IV</num>., but especially Plus V., renewed and extended the walls of &#x0022;the <rs type="place">Leonine City</rs>,&#x0022; which were strengthened by the bastions erected after the designs of <persName n="Sangallo,,Antonio,,,de" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00554" reg="expanded:Sangallo,Antonio,,,"><foreName>Antonio</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Sangallo</surname></persName> and of <persName n="Angelo,,Michael,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00555" reg="default:Angelo,Michael,,,"><foreName>Michael</foreName> <surname>Angelo</surname></persName>. &#x0022;The <rs type="place">Leonine City</rs>,&#x0022; with its present enlarged boundary, is somewhat more than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> in circumference, and might contain a population of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>It contains <num value="4">four</num> squares, those of Scossavavalli, Rusticucci, Santa Marta, and <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName>'s. The <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> journalists who recommend the restriction of the <name>Papal</name> sovereignty to the boundaries of &#x0022;the <rs type="place">Leonine City</rs>&#x0022; do not fail style to remark that there is a vast difference, after all, between the position of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Popes in the <name>Catacombs</name>, and the <name>Pontiffs</name> who should enjoy undisturbed security and ease within the limits traced out by <persName n="Leo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00556" reg="mostcommon:Leo,nomatch:0"><surname>Leo</surname></persName>. They do not fail to recall to mind that <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName>'s is still the wonder of the world; that the <name>Palace</name> of Branante is unsurpassed in beauty; that the residence of the <rs>Pope</rs> is unequaled in extent and splendor; that <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> persons can dwell comfortable within its walls; that in <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> <orgName n="National Guard" type="militia">National Guards</orgName> performed their evolutions in <num value="1">one</num> of its courts; that <persName n="Angelo,,Michael,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00557" reg="default:Angelo,Michael,,,"><foreName>Michael</foreName> <surname>Angelo</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Raphael</foreName></persName> have adorned it with the highest triumphs of their genius; that its gardens, with their terraces and parterres, and temples and statues, and groves and grottoes, and artificial rocks and ponds, and waterworks, reproduce, in their scenes of varied beauty, all that poetry has fabled of the enchanted gardens of Armida.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> announcement <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> ago of the proposed scheme called down on the head of its author a perfect storm of abuse from the official and semi-official scribes of the <rs type="place">Court of Rome</rs>, and the organ of the <name>Jesuits</name>, the <rs>Civilta Cattolica</rs>, was instructed to refute it at great length and with great vehemence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Not the less (probably, indeed, much the more) on that account, the plan is stated to have struck deep root in the convictions and hopes of the inhabitants of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> itself, and we are informed that its realization is regarded as furnishing at least some approximation to a pacific settlement of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> question.--<hi rend="italics"><orgName n="London Post" type="newspaper">London Post</orgName>.</hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
