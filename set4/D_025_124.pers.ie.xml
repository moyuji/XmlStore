<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> Firstly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/><placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName> has never been occupied by a larger force of our troops than <num value="1">one</num> small brigade &mdash; that of General Law &mdash; the object of which was simply to picket the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, watch the movements of the enemy, and cover the retreat of our sharpshooters and skirmishers (whenever attacked) engaged in harassing the wagon trains running to and from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/></item> 
<item n="2"> Secondly. We could not extend our lines beyond <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> to the left, because of the disintegration of our forces which would be necessarily involved in such a movement, and the consequent weakening of our lines elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The difficulty of transporting troops or supplies across the mountain, within point blank range of the guns of <placeName reg="Moccasin Battery">Moccasin Battery</placeName>, was in itself a bar to the permanent occupation of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>From this cause alone it was found almost impossible to furnish regular rations to even the single brigade of General Law, every pound having to be <sic>carried</sic> at night, in panniers, on the backs of mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/></item> 
<item n="3"> Thirdly. The advance of the <rs>Federals</rs> from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Harrison, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117581">Bridgeport</placeName> was known to <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> from the start, and progress was reported from hour to hour as the troops marched up the valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>(This fact I learn from <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs type="role" reg="signal-Officer">signal officers</rs>.) Consequently there was no surprise and no lack of time for adequate preparation to give them battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The object of the <rs>Federals</rs> was penetrated at once; and if these officers fully possessed of all information bearing on the present and future, with plans of operation elsewhere already matured in their minds, adjudged it prudent to allow the enemy to pass unmolested, it was a concession with which no <num value="1">one</num> here or elsewhere, who desires to maintain public confidence, and unite and inspire the popular heart, ought to find fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/></item> 
<item n="4"> <hi rend="italics">Fourthly.</hi> Had an attack been made on the columns of the enemy while in motion up the valley, beyond doubt it would have precipitated a general battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Reinforcements would have poured out of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> across <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName> <num value="3">three</num> times more expeditiously than we could have thrown troops across <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>, (through a demoralizing fire,) and sweeping down on our rear, or even encountering our front in the valley, would have rendered the result of an engagement, to say the least, doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Granting success, however, what would have been accomplished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The defeat of <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> of the enemy &mdash; the retention of a valley whose occupation would have weakened our line and been of no permanent or practical benefit &mdash; the loss of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> men without commensurate advantages, at a time when every strong right arm was indispensable to the service, and the grand issue involved in the investment of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> would not have been directly effected in the slightest degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is true that without the valley the <rs>Federals</rs> would have been compelled to rely for the rations on wagon transportation over mountain roads, and that eventually they may have been forced to retire to some point near their base of supplies; but this, if not a problematical, is a negative result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>If the <rs>Federals</rs> had determined to hold <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, they would have done so in spite of mountain roads and a blockaded railway to Bridge port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>We have not, therefore, been &#x0022;outgeneraled by the enemy,&#x0022; and their movement was not &#x0022;masterly in conception and fruitless in execution.&#x0022; It was by a simple concession on our part that they were allowed to pursue their purpose.--reopen communication with <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName> and establish themselves for the winter; and future developments will prove the correctness of the judgment by which that concession was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/></item> </list> 
<p> It is an error, too, to suppose that the mere possession of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> is the stake for which this army is contending, and the fact that the <rs>Federals</rs> may remain undisturbed there during the winter adds and subtracts nothing from our prospects of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>In truth, there are many officers who believe that we are better off where we are, with a railroad at our back, than if we were <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> and dependent for supplies on the rugged roads and faulty wagons, which would be our bane during the winter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> Finally. We have not &#x0022;lost the advantages of our position.&#x0022; <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> is still in our possession, and, to all intents and purposes, the lines of the army have not been changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>With this great and almost impassable wall on our left, effectually barring the advance of the enemy from that direction, and <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, with its steep sides, on our front, no General can ask a more desirable place of defence than that which is now held by this army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> If the enemy have succeeded in provisioning themselves for the winter, it is only what they would have done, under any other circumstances, somewhere else &mdash; perhaps not so favorably to us &mdash; and this fact will, in no wise, interfere with the general battle which is eventually to decide the strength of the <num value="2">two</num> armies, and, probably, the issue of the war. It is a question of fighting, and not of eating, with which we have to contend, and a winter's idleness in <num value="1">one</num> place or another has little to do with the solution of the problem while the <num value="2">two</num> armies confront each other intact. </p>
