<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It does their excellent hearts good to imagine us all ragged and starving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>They have no higher idea of human happiness than to possess the belly of a hog and the fleece of a sheep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>They have no faith in anything which composes the inside of a man except his intestines, and if these are daily crammed with codfish and chowder they permit the soul to take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Most of them have little belief in a soul of any kind, rationally refusing to recognize the existence of that which they have no evidence of in their own consciousness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> If it gives these refined and benevolent people any satisfaction to know that we have not as much to eat and drink as themselves, we will not withhold from them the admission that it is even so; that, though no starving, we are living on <rs n="Spartan" type="ethnic">Spartan</rs> diet; that, though not naked, we are far from wearing purple and fine linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>We are almost in as doleful plight for food and raiment as the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>But if we have laid aside every weight, it is that we may be prepared for the race; if we are stripped of raiment, we are more ready for the fight; and all our privations are only the rigid training that the pugilist undergoes to prepare him for the decisive struggle. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> Let the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> beware of the half starved wolf!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Let them realize that, if they have loosened for us most of the ties which make men cling to life, they have only made us more dangerous enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>We owe them a long and heavy account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>We shall endeavor to pay it up in full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The day of reckoning is coming, and they will then discover that the moderation which we have hitherto exhibited under such wrongs as humanity has rarely been called upon to endure was the result of anything but fear. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
