<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The news yesterday received from the recent field of battle fully confirms the statement of the withdrawal of the entire force of the enemy from the front of our lines, and leaves little doubt that his forces are seeking another point at which to make an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>This movement by <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, we are satisfied, is well understood by our able commanding General, and will be met with that promptness which so effectually checked the enemy's advance at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Parties who left <placeName reg="Summit Station, Clermont, Ohio" key="tgn,2703627">Summit Station</placeName> yesterday represent that the enemy, in force, had been seen on the <rs>Northern</rs> side of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> in <placeName reg="King George, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002547">King George county</placeName>, nearly opposite <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName>, and that the impression prevailed that they would attempt a passage of the river at that point, under cover of their gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We are not sufficiently acquainted with the topography of that section to state whether or not it is favorable to their operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The train which came down last night brought to the city <num value="200">200</num> of our wounded, <measure n="40" type="sick">40 sick</measure>, and <measure n="11" type="wounded">11 wounded</measure> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>A member of the <rs>Ambulance Committee</rs>, from this city, who returned on this train, says that <num value="450">450</num> of the enemy's wounded would be at <placeName reg="Summit Station, Clermont, Ohio" key="tgn,2703627">Summit Station</placeName> this morning, and will be brought down as soon as transportation can be obtained for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>A correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi> writing from <placeName key="tgn,7014076" n="1.000 108" reg="goldsboro, wayne, north carolina">Goldsboro</placeName>', under date of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>, says that the fighting on Sunday was very severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Our own forces numbered less than <num value="3000">three thousand</num>, whilst the enemy had, at the lowest estimate, <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the fight of Saturday we lost <num value="1">one</num> field piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The battle on Sunday was commenced about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> in the morning and lasted until <num value="5">5</num> in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our men fought with excellent spirit, and did not retreat until flanked on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The only open road left was over the bridge across the <rs>Neuse</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>After a portion of our forces had crossed an attempt was made to fire the bridge, but it failed, and the enemy succeeded in crossing under a heavy fire from our artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A number of our men were cut off from crossing, and it is supposed were taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our army has retired to Falling <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2075343" n="1.000 86" reg="kinston, lenoir, north carolina">Kinston</placeName></placeName>.

<head>Important rumor.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> During the day yesterday a rumor was extensively circulated in the city to the effect that an order had been issued from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> for the arrest of <persName n="Buren,,John,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="expanded:Buren,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName> in New York, which had met with such furious resistance as to prevent the execution of the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Great excitement is represented to have existed in New York on the announcement of the order, and among the <name>Conservatives</name> the determination was general that it should not be carried into effect.--How this rumor originated, or where it came from, we are not prepared to say. Our Northern dates, up to the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> make no mention of the affair. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="4"> 
<head>The enemy in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> From all that we have been able to learn from the <rs type="place">Lower Valley</rs> within the past <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, we think it highly probably that <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> has again been occupied by the <rs>Federal</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Our own troops, under command of <persName n="Jones,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Jones,A.,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, fell back on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and it was rumored that the enemy were moving upon <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> from <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We had a conversation yesterday with a person who remained in <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> in charge of some property, both on the occasion of the occupation last summer and on the late occasion. --He says that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were most awfully flogged on last <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and that the slaughter was awful beyond conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He says they must have lost at least <num value="20000">20,000</num> men, and that this is not a mere random guess of a person unaccustomed to military estimates, is sustained by the opinions of an intelligent gentlemen who had opportunities of knowing, and who likewise estimates the loss at <num value="15000">15,000</num> to <num value="20000">20,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He says that when he left the place, after the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had gone, there were large numbers of dead lying unburied in the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He says they returned from the field in the wildest disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It was found impossible to restrain them, if any attempt was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>All discipline, all subordination, was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They pillaged every house in the town, ransacking the whole from garret to cellar &mdash; smashing the windows, doors, and furniture of every description &mdash; and committing every possible species of outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They broke the chinaware, smashed the pianos, and annihilated the chairs tables, and bedsteads. --They cut open the beds, emptied the contents in the street, and burned the bed ticks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They stole all the blankets sheets, counterpanes, and everything they could use. They broke into the cellars and drank all the liquors they could find so that the whole army became a drunken and furious mob. He thinks that not a single house in town escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>This infernal carnival was held all throughout the night of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, all day and all night <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and until the evening of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.--At that time, from some cause which he could not understand, they seemed to be suddenly taken with a panic, and continued in a terrible state of alarm until the evacuation commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>From the account of our informant we should infer that they were marching down to <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Such are the savages sent to teach us civilization. </p> </div3>

<head>States Guaranteeing Confederate bonds.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The telegraph <rs>Monday</rs> announced that the <orgName n="South Carolina Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of South Carolina</orgName> has unanimously pledged the faith and funds of that State to the redemption of its quota of the <rs>Confederate</rs> debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The following is the report upon which the bill passed was based: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> The <orgName n="Ways and Means Committee" type="committee">Committee of Ways and Means</orgName>, to which was referred the resolution to inquire into the expediency of offering to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to guarantee its bonds for the proportionate share of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, according to the basis of the late war tax, to the amount of <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars, beg leave respectfully to report unanimously that they have had the same under consideration, and agree in the principle of the resolution, but propose that the amount be changed from <num value="100">one hundred</num> to <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The large and increasing circulation of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName> demands a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The amount already in circulation is much greater than even in time of peace is necessary for our internal and foreign commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In the present state of affairs a smaller amount is needed than is then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The consequence is that our citizens and Government have to give prices so greatly enhanced as to be a matter of great detriment to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Our individual citizens are already suffering greatly; and the <rs>Government</rs> not only suffers with them now, but lies under the further liability of having to give its obligations at the current prices in securities which must finally be redeemed in <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> Attempts have been made by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to reduce this circulation by funding portions of it in Confederate bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The extent, however, to which these have been taken has, from various reasons, been very limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>A portion of the <num value="100000000">hundred million</num> loan yet remains to be issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>This arises from the want of ability to take it up on the part of our citizens as is readily seen from the large surplus of circulation above referred to. More than this, other securities, and especially those of the <name>States</name> paying a lower rate of interest, are extensively sought after, and are bringing high premiums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The object of this endorsement would be, so far as the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> is concerned, to give the <rs>Government</rs> all the advantages to be obtained by uniting State security to that offered by the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It is hoped that the other States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> will unite with us in so doing; but it is eminently proper that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> should take the lead in this kind of expression of full confidence in the final success of our Government.--Yet it is proper, in so doing, that she should secure for herself and her citizens, and not for them alone, but for all other States and their citizens which shall concur with us in this act, the right to obtain bonds thus endorsed, provided the bids they make are equal to those of any others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>In order to secure the largest price, also, and to give the country a fair opportunity to invest in these securities, they should be offered by public advertisement to the highest bidder, in such portions and at such times as the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> may deem best. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> A further reason which has governed the committee is that the <rs>General Government</rs> is constantly in need of foreign exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>At present this must be bought at <num value="2">two hundred per cent</num> premium, or <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">three hundred dollars</measure> must be given in this country for <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If our Government should offer bonds abroad they would be met by the declaration that, from the very nature of our Government, it is liable to be <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> broken up by the action of the <name>States</name>, in like manner as has been done in the separation from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of the <name>States</name> now forming this Confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Not only this, our Government is, by persons abroad, still looked upon as an experiment which may prove a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>But the <name>States</name> are regarded as permanent, and their existence, under all circumstances, considered as certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>An obligation, therefore, given by a State, either directly or indirectly, possesses abroad an actual value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It is manifest that rules of Confederate bonds, with State endorsements, will therefore not only be possible, but may be made at prices that will secure exchange on terms far more advantageous to the <rs>Government</rs> than the present or probable future rate of exchange will make possible, and a portion of the bonds thus endorsed could be profitably used in this way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> It is upon these grounds that the <rs>Committee</rs> approve the principle of the resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>They have, however, owing to the large amount of surplus circulation to be absorbed, as well as the future demands of the <rs>Government</rs> thought best to recommend a larger sum than was stated in the resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The sale of <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars would not be adequate to retire more than <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> of Treasury Notes, and would leave <num value="230000000">two hundred and thirty millions</num> still in circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><num value="30000000">Thirty millions</num> of dollars, with the issues constantly making by the <rs>Government</rs>, and the bills of our <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> still in circulation, would be abundant for the necessities of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>This would be accomplished if, with the <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of endorsed bonds <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of currency could be absorbed and this is extremely probable. </p> 
<p>
