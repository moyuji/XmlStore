<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He says he has not yet done anything to merit such an honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This is more modest than his boasting proclamation that he had put an end to Secession in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and his more recent pronunciamento from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>-- &#x0022;Soldiers, we have seen our last defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>No more defeats; no more retreats You stand by me, and I'll stand by you&#x0022;--which had an immediate commentary in the fastest time ever made by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves, in that wonderful foot-race at <placeName key="tgn,2008719" n="1.000 1" reg="lewisville, lafayette, arkansas">Lewisville</placeName>, and lately in the overwhelming rout at <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is also more truthful than his report of the killed and wounded at <placeName reg="Rich Mountain, Randolph, West Virginia" key="tgn,2616904">Rich Mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>And if he has done nothing to merit a sword, pray, what has he accomplished, to be made <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We have often referred to this danger, as <num value="1">one</num> which, if not provided against in time, will render all the blood and treasure expended in the war entirely profitless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The consequence is that while ships have become more perfect and powerful machines, seamen have deteriorated, and become mere stokers and ferrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The South will suffer no injury from this change, because it can build a navy upon the models of existing improvements, and man it without requiring for that purpose thoroughbred sailors, of whom it has very few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We, who are in the service as privates and non-commissioned officers, have not many opportunities of seeing the daily papers, and thus keeping on the surface of event, we thought not of the wrangling of politicians, but were credulous enough to imagine that those self-sacrificing <hi rend="italics">patriots,</hi> who were filling lucrative offices, far out of range and &#x0022;hearing of the enemy's guns,&#x0022; regarded our General as we regard him &mdash; the pride of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> (this night <num value="1">one</num> week ago) this locality was visited by a tremendous gale of wind accompanied by a soaking rain, which comedown incessantly for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, it was at the culminating point of its terrific grandeur, and I am pleased to say submerged the canal in many places, and injured that great artery of Federal transportation to a great extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It has not yet been ascertained the amount of damage done the canal; but we know it to be broken at <placeName reg="Dam 4">Dam No. 4</placeName>; and judging from the number of boats now lying opposite this place, unable to proceed further, we are sure that the canal is materially injured, inasmuch that navigation upon it has ceased for this season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Thus we find that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has kindly interfered in our behalf, and blockaded, <hi rend="italics">by a breach,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of &#x0022;old <persName><foreName>Abe</foreName></persName>'s important feeders. &#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> The recent gale verified the old adage that &#x0022;it is an ill wind that blows nobody good. &#x0022;--It assuredly favored us most lavishly; for I notice it extended from <num value="1">one</num> end of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to the other, doing great damage to our adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>This canal was all-important to them, rendered more so from the fact that it had to supply the place of the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It was the only medium of transportation between the <rs>Capital</rs> and <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and other points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>They appreciated its value, and sent soldiers to guard and protect it. But soldiers were of no avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The power brought against it was mightier than bayonets, and sentinels challenged in vain; the rain descended, the flood came, and washed away the canal banks &mdash; and great was the <hi rend="italics">wash</hi> thereof! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> Last night, at <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> <num value="2">two</num> deserters from the rebel camp at Big Bethel came to our outside pickets for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Their names are <persName n="Dennis,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="default:Dennis,William,,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <surname>Dennis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smarss,,Andrew,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="default:Smarss,Andrew,J.,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Smarss</surname></persName> and they are both natives of <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, Ga, and privates in the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 10">tenth regiment</orgName> <orgName type="mil" key="GAVolunteer">Georgia Volunteers</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The word &#x0022;volunteers&#x0022; must not, however, be taken in its literal sense, for these men, with others, were impressed into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Of course all their protestations were unheeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>They left Big Bethel at <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> in the morning, and by keeping in the woods and wading through swamps they succeeded in making good their escape, although at <num value="1">one</num> time they were very closely pursued.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> There exists a good deal of dissatisfaction among the men on account of the insufficient clothing, the cruel treatment, and the want of promptness in the pay department; since <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> last they have only received <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> pay, and that, of course, in shinplasters, which they are unable to get rid of except by buying sutler's goods at exorbitant prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The men are only furnished with flour and meat; tea and coffee are luxuries unheard of, and to procure an antidote against the fever, which makes such havoc among them, they dig up <unclear> safras </unclear> roots and make a kind of tea of them, which they drink on getting up in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>During these <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> they have had to work constantly on the batteries, and all the spare time has been filled up with fatiguing drills, <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> while the men are forbidden the use of liquor, the officers are drunk most of the time, and it is surprising, with all the discontent prevailing in the ranks, that no mutiny has yet taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The battery at Big Bethel consists of <num value="12">twelve</num> pieces of small rifled cannon, and is said to be well manned. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>etc.: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> The bridle of a lady's horse should be a single rein curb &mdash; never a snaffle to be pulled upon &mdash; requiring the strength of a thread only to guide and direct the animal, and drawn only when the horse is required to be stopped; at all times to be kept slightly in hand, or be permitted to lie gently on the arched neck of the beautiful creature, permitting him to look abroad upon things, and see the road he is traveling; starting with a bound into a graceful canter at the leaning forward of the rider without the use of the whip or other incentive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> We had supposed a double bridle was preferable &mdash; that is, a curb and snaffle, either of which could be used as occasion required.--The majority of <name>English</name> ladies use such a bridle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> The paces of a lady's horse should be long rather than short, that the rider may bend gracefully forward, and not be jerked backward at every step in the most vulgar manner imaginable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>A lady-equestrian must never appear in a hurry; it is unbecoming and ungenteel, and many instances are on record showing that a horse knows a gentleman or a lady at sight, as well as most of us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> An <name>English</name> lady of rank and wealth, now in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, writes home as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> I fear you may deem me rather boastful of my horsemanship when I tell you that <num value="2">two</num> Arab horses which threw their cavaliers did not throw me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> I have had plenty of opportunities to make the experiment, and in my own stable there is a beautiful gray Arab, which nobody but myself dares ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>He knows me, anticipates my wishes, and judiciously calculates the degree of fatigue I can bear without inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>It is curious to see how he manages to quicken his pace without shaking me, and the different sorts of steps he has invented to remedy contradictory purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Horses being as liable to forgetfulness as other organized beings, my incomparable gray would allow his natural ambition to overcome his gallantry, and if another horse happened to pass him, would start off with the speed of a whirlwind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Woe to me, if under such circumstances, I were to trust to the strength of my arm, or the power of the bridle ! I know the gallant charger better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Leaving my hand loose, and abandoning all thoughts of compulsion, I would take to persuasion &mdash; pat him on the neck, call him by his name, beg him to be quiet and deserve the piece of sugar waiting for him at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Never did these gentle means fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Instantly would he slacken his neck, prick up his ears as if fully comprehending his error, and come back to a soft amble, gently neighing, as if to crave pardon for his momentary offence. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> It has been apparent, for many months, and is obvious now, that the enemy is making a formidable demonstration towards <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Our correspondence from <placeName reg="Tazewell, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002192">Tazewell county</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, which we published yesterday, sets down the column operating against <persName n="Williams,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> at <num value="10000">10,000</num> strong; and it was believed that the force before <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>, from which that General has been obliged to retreat upon <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName>, is probably twice as large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>At the same time that we hear of the retreat of <persName n="Williams,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> upon <placeName reg="Payne Gap, Letcher, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040707">Pound Gap</placeName>, we hear apprehensions expressed for the safety of <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> The object of the enemy in pushing forward these columns is probably threefold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The chief purpose, doubtless, is to bring into its own support the large disaffected element of the population in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, which have been corrupted by the clamor of <persName n="Johnson,,Andy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="default:Johnson,Andy,,,"><foreName>Andy</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Maynard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Maynard,nomatch:0"><surname>Maynard</surname></persName>, <persName n="Brownlow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Brownlow,nomatch:0"><surname>Brownlow</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Trigg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Trigg,nomatch:0"><surname>Trigg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The next object of the enemy is, probably, to get possession of the salt- works in the <rs>Western</rs> corner of <placeName reg="Smyth, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002191">Smyth co.</placeName>, where half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of bushels of salt a year are now manufactured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>And last, but not least, the enemy aims at the possession of a portion of the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee railroad</orgName>, so as to cut our direct communication, from the <name>Seat</name> of Government, with <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and our armies in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The clandestine burning of bridges, at a concerted period, in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName>; proves the enemy's designs upon this important highway of transportation and travel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> It is very plain that, however our own Government may depreciate the importance of these designs of the enemy, the enemy himself is pushing them forward with his accustomed enterprise and perseverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>It looks now as if the old tactics are to be repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We are to sit still until the country is occupied; until the enemy has entered, taken possession, and made himself at home; and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> we are to wake up to the fact that something must be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>In military tactics, no less than in medical economy, does the maxim hold good that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It is not yet too late to bring this maxim into play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>A few regiments, and a moderate supply of arms, ammunition, and artillery properly but immediately distributed at commanding points in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, and along the chief approaches from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, will do more now than a great army could effect if once the enemy gets into that region of country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> is intrinsically very important to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>She has sent a very large quota of her young men into the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate Army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Her population are true; and we have an earnest of what it is disposed to do in the announcement from <placeName key="tgn,2101777" n="1.000 14" reg="tazewell, claiborne, tennessee">Tazewell</placeName>, which we published yesterday, that <persName n="Bowen,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Bowen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bowen</surname></persName>, of that county, was bringing his Brigade of Militia into the field to meet the enemy in the passes of the <rs type="place">Cumberland Mountain</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>That is the temper of the people in all the counties of that region, <persName n="Smyth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Smyth,nomatch:0"><surname>Smyth</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wythe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Wythe,nomatch:0"><surname>Wythe</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Russell,John,,,:1"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Baker,P.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Scott,G.,H.,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, and <placeName key="tgn,2101777" n="1.000 14" reg="tazewell, claiborne, tennessee">Tazewell</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>They lack arms and ammunition, but they do not lack the disposition to fight the enemies of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, or to meet and drive back the minions of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>They may lack skill with artillery, but they are masters of the rifle, and know how to make that instrument speak a language before which the stoutest invader must recoil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>No Government can afford to let such a population as this be overrun, or to lose a district from which so many of its best soldiers are supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Intrinsically important as <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> is to the <rs>Government</rs>, from the qualities of its people, it is even more important from its geographical position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>If that country be given up, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> be in consequence lost, the <rs>Empire</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> is cut in twain, and we become a fragmentary organization, fighting in scattered and segregated localities for a cause which can no longer boast the important attribute of geographical unity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> We are glad to believe that the <rs>Government</rs> is fully impressed with these views, and that orders have already been issued to meet the emergency of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>A strong demonstration in the threatened quarter would overawe the enemy, and keep him at bay behind the rocky rampart of the <rs type="place">Cumberland ridge</rs> of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>If he knows that the whole Secession population of the counties of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> are armed, provided with ammunition and artillery, awaiting his approach; and that several Confederate regiments are guarding the passes of the mountains and the line of the railroad, he will not dare to show his face on the <rs>Eastern</rs> slope of the <rs>Cumberland</rs> barrier, even if he should have the temerity to attempt to force the passes. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> Thursday dawned gloriously upon our wearied but undaunted gunners, and all felt that the day of trial had at last arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Scarcely had breakfast been dispatched when the hostile fleet was observed in commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>The great war seenmers formed rapidly in single file, and within supporting distance of each other, the <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Minnesota</rs>, the flagship of <persName n="Dupont,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00345" reg="mostcommon:Dupont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Com.</roleName> <surname>Dupont</surname></persName>, in the van. As the long line of formidable-looking vessels, <num value="13">thirteen</num> in number, most of them powerful propellers, with a few sailing men-of-war in tow swept rapidly and majestically in, with ports open and bristling with guns of the heaviest calibre, the sight was grand and imposing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>This was at <time value="8:30oclock">half past 8 o'clock</time> Until the <rs>Minnesota</rs> came within the range of and opposite to our batteries on <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName>, all was still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Suddenly, the <num value="15">fifteen</num> heavy guns of <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName>, which had been aimed directly at the huge frigate, belched forth their simultaneous fire, and the action was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Almost immediately afterwards, the batteries of <placeName key="tgn,2096117" n="1.000 4" reg="lands end, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Beauregard</placeName>, on the other side of the entrance, also opened their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The enemy at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> did not reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>But, as the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> steamer came opposite to <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName>, the hulls of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> were suddenly wrapped in smoke, and the shot and shell of <num value="3">three</num> tremendous broadsides, making in all <num value="75">seventy-five</num> guns, came crashing against our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>From this moment the bombardment was terrific and incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/><num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the propellers bore down upon our forts, delivered their fire as they passed, <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> until, <num value="9">nine</num> had gained the <name>Interior</name> of the harbor, beyond the range of our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>The <rs>Minnesota</rs>, still followed by the others, then turned round and steamed slowly out, giving a broadside to <placeName key="tgn,2096117" n="1.000 4" reg="lands end, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Beauregard</placeName> as she repassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Thus the battle was continued, the enemy's vessels sailing in an elliptical curve, pouring <num value="1">one</num> broadside into <placeName key="possibilities=32" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Bay Point</placeName>, and then sweeping around to deliver the other against <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>This furious fire from some <num value="400">four hundred</num> guns, many of them of the <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00346" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> pattern, and some even of <measure n="13inch" type="distance">13-inch</measure> bore, (for a sabot of that diameter was found in <placeName key="tgn,2096117" n="1.000 4" reg="lands end, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Beauregard</placeName>,) was maintained incessantly, and the roar of the cannonade seemed most continuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Mean while our garrisons were making a gallant defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>They kept up a vigorous and well-directed fire against their assailants, and notwithstanding that their best gun was dismounted at the beginning of the action, they succeeded in setting fire to several of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>When ever this happened, however, the enemy would haul off and soon extinguish the flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>The effect of our guns was, in many instances, plainly visible from the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>Although the sides of the <rs>Minnesota</rs> are of massive strength, several of her ports were knocked into <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Nor was she the only vessel upon which this evidence of the power of our fire could be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Many of the other steamers were likewise badly hulled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/> After some time spent in sailing round and delivering their broadsides in rotation, in the manner we have described, the enemy's steamers adopted another and more successful plan of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/><num value="1">One</num> of them took a position inside the harbor, so as to enfilade the batteries of <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName>, while several opened a simultaneous enfilading fire from the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>Besides this terrific cross fire, <num value="2">two</num> of the largest steamers maintained the fire in front of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Thus <num value="3">three</num> furious converging streams of shot and shell were rained amongst the brave little garrison for hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>The vessels came up within <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure> of the shore, but nearly all our guns had, by this time, become dismounted, and we were no longer able to reply with serious effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> Soon after <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time>, the batteries of <placeName key="possibilities=32" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Bay Point</placeName> were silenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The fire of <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName>, as far as the guns that remained were concerned, was not a whit slackened, until <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>. By that time the dreadful condition of the fort became too apparent to be longer disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The guns lay in every direction, dismantled and useless; the defences were terribly shattered, the dead and dying were to be seen on every side, and still the iron hail poured pitilessly in. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head><placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName> abandoned.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/> In this strait, it was determined to abandon the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>A long waste, about a mile in extent, and commanded by the enemy's guns, intervened between the garrison and the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Across this they were ordered to run for their lives, each man for himself; the object being to scatter them as much as possible, so as not to afford a target for the rifled guns of the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>The preparations for running this perilous gauntlet were soon made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Knapsacks were abandoned, but the men retained their muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Each of the wounded was placed in a blanket and carried off by <num value="4">four</num> men. The safety of the living precluded the idea of removing the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>And thus the gallant little band quitted the scene of their glory, and scampered off, each <num value="1">one</num> as best he could, towards the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>The retreat was covered by a small detachment who remained for an hour after their comrades had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Among those who remained were <persName n="Harms,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00347" reg="mostcommon:Harms,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Harms</surname></persName>, with <num value="6">six</num> men; <persName n="Melchers,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00348" reg="mostcommon:Melchers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Melchers</surname></persName>, with <num value="4">four</num> men, and <persName n="Bischoff,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00349" reg="mostcommon:Bischoff,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Bischoff</surname></persName>, with <num value="4">four</num> men. These worked the guns until about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, when they also quitted the post. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/> The abandonment of <placeName key="tgn,2096117" n="1.000 4" reg="lands end, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Beauregard</placeName> was equally a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The garrison were exhausted, and in momentary danger of being cut off. When <persName n="Dunovant,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00350" reg="mostcommon:Dunovant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Dunovant</surname></persName> ordered a retreat, tears of mortification and indignation filled the eyes of <persName n="Elliott,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00351" reg="mostcommon:Elliott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName> at the sad necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The retreat was admirably conducted, and rendered entirely successful by the prudent energy of <persName n="Hanckel,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00352" reg="mostcommon:Hanckel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hanckel</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Ripley,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00353" reg="mostcommon:Ripley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName>'s Aids, who had got together some <num value="12">twelve</num> fiats at Station <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, by which the troops passed safely over to <placeName reg="Saint Helena Island, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2637230">St. Helena island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>From there they passed to <placeName reg="Beaufort Island, Screven, Georgia" key="tgn,2156899">Beaufort Island</placeName>, and reached the train at <placeName key="tgn,2589001" n="1.000 3" reg="pocotaligo, jasper, south carolina">Pocataligo</placeName> without the loss or injury of a man. In this Fort none were killed, and but <num value="5">five</num> were wounded, and <num value="2">two</num> of these were wounded by negligence in loading a cannon, by which hot shot was driven on the powder, without the wet wad preceding it. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> The rest of the story is briefly told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>Late <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the garrison of <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 6" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Fort Walker</placeName> had collected at the landing, in the hope of being able to reach <placeName reg="Bluffton, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095374">Bluffton</placeName> by water, Luckily, several small Confederate steamers were within hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>But here a ludicrous mistake occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>The retreating troops imagined the little steamers to be <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gunboats; while the crews of the steamers were convinced that the troops were a body of disembarked <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Acting upon this double delusion, a deal of mutual reconnoitering was made, and it was only after a vast variety of strategic approaches that they reached the conclusion that it was &#x0022;all right.&#x0022; A quick trip to <placeName reg="Bluffton, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095374">Bluffton</placeName> followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Thence the troops marched to <placeName reg="Hardeeville, Jasper, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095951">Hardeeville</placeName> <measure n="17miles" type="distance">17 miles distant</measure>. The road along which they dragged their exhausted frames was filled with a heterogeneous throng of fugitives of all conditions, carriages, carts, and conveyances of every description that could, by any possibility, be pressed into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The spectacle was a sad <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/> Thus ended the defence of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>The mortification of the disaster is lessened by the consciousness that our troops deserved success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/> What injury we did to the enemy, we do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Our firing was, of course, less efficient than theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Our troops were volunteers &mdash; theirs were picked artillerists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Yet, it is very remarkable how few were killed or wounded, amongst our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>This battle, in this respect, was very much like the <rs n="Battle of Fort Sumter" type="battle">battle of Fort Sumter</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>How so many cannon could have been dismantled and rendered useless, and yet so few of those who worked them injured, seems very marvellous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Our troops did their duty faithfully and bravely, and fought until to fight longer would have been sheer folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Though encountering immense odds, no signs of cowardice marked their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Officers and soldiers exemplified the ancient character of the <rs>State</rs>, and deserve our profound gratitude and admiration. </p> </div4>
