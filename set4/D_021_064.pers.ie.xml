<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/> Intelligent reader, if you were required to make a pair of negro's brogans, would you not reply that you could not make them, because you never learned the shoemaker's trade?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Supposing you to be honest, patriotic, intelligent, over <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of age, and wholly unacquainted with the practice or science of military matters, and you were offered an appointment as <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, or <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, or General in the <name>Confederats</name> army, with a salary of <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, or <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">three thousand dollars</measure> per annum, would you not unhesitatingly reply, <q>&#x0022;I know nothing of the art of war; am too old to learn, and will not, for the sake of fifthy lucre, betray my country !&#x0022; </q> <q>&#x0022;Appoint somebody also who has learned military affairs, either at school or in camp.&#x0022;</q> Are stump orators Gods; born like <persName n="Minerva,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00343" reg="mostcommon:Minerva,nomatch:0"><surname>Minerva</surname></persName>, <persName n="Bellona,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="mostcommon:Bellona,nomatch:0"><surname>Bellona</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00345" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName>, full armed, all- wise and invincible chieftains; and you, my intelligent readers, made of different and of baser clay, can you conceive it possible for a mere mortal, past <num value="50">fifty</num>, to become a good soldier or a great General, without previous study, or practice, or experience?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Cartainly not. If a single <num value="1">one</num> of our improvised officers makes a good leader from the start, he must be like <persName><foreName>Joan</foreName></persName> of Are, inspired from above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>But the day of miracles and of impiration has passed, and we are doomed to frequent reverses and defeats, until our young stump-crater officers have learned the art of war, and the old ones are sloughed off. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/> The war will last so long as mere demagogues occupy high places, either in civil life or in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>When we get rid of them, we shall see light ahead, and feel hope reviving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>We shall, in the meantime, learn a useful lesson, gain valuable experience, yet pay most dearly for it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> We were much offended at hearing a distinguished officer, when the war had just begun, lamenting the enthusiasm and inconsiderateness with which our people entered into it. We now see, and feel, that he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Our furor and enthusiasm clouded our judgments, made us overrate ourselves and underrats our enemies, and begat remireness and rashness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>No doubt, at the time of their appointment, our stump crators believed themselves quite a match for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and probably our intelligent readers then concurred in the opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>They and the public, since passion has cooled, and judgment and reason resumed their away, have learned better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Our armies will soon be filled with new levies, whilst those opposed to us have been subjected for many months to excellent drill and discipline.--We must not have ignorant and inexperienced officers to command, train and discipline ignorant and inexperienced troops. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
