<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They might collect the revenue and blockade Southern ports, if it were necessary; but if they invaded a State, there would be war. His advice was, that if peaceable means failed, it was better to let the <rs>Cotton States</rs> go &mdash; it was better to lose them than to lose them and the <rs>Border States</rs> also, by attempting coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Coercion was not the policy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had in his proclamation disavowed his intention to invade Southern States, but he has invaded them, and the <rs>Southern States</rs> should all make common cause in resistance to that invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had called not only for <num value="75000">75,000</num>, but <num value="200000">200,000</num> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He might not call marching these troops through the <rs>Border States</rs> to suppress armed combinations in the <rs>Southern States</rs> <hi rend="italics">&#x0022;subjugation,&#x0022;</hi> but what else would it be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The presence of these troops would overawe the citizens, would humiliate all &mdash; would humiliate the <rs>Union</rs> men as well as the <name>Secessionists</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> It is true that the invading <rs>Generals</rs> issue proclamations that they will protect private property, but what are these proclamations worth when you look at the composition of their troops?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The leaders are ambitions politicians, and the men are desperate fanatics &mdash; the conservative people stay at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The leaders are unable to control the men, and their paper proclamations amount to nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The very presence of such an army in any Southern State demoralizes the slaves &mdash; they are ruinous, and ought to be resisted and driven back. **** </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> <persName n="Bell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Bell,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName> did not say that the acts of the <name>Legislature</name> were constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He believed they were extra-constitutional, but in a Revolution all laws and all constitutions were done away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is no law about it. The Union men of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> were pledged to submit if the <rs>State</rs> voted out by a clear majority &mdash; with a qualification &mdash; namely, if it was done without fraud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>That was anidle qualification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>There never was an election without some degree of fraud, on the side or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Then, too, they thought the law entitling volunteers to vote in other than their own counties, was not constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But if the law entitling them thus to vote was unconstitutional, the same law authorized the election, and every other vote was equally unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>If these volunteers were entitled to vote at home, anybody who would seek to deprive them of their vote, because they were encamped away from home, was not himself worthy to exercise the rights of a free man. The very term &#x0022;revolution&#x0022; implied irregularity, and in a revolution it could not be otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If there was anything legal about it, these volunteers in camp who were entitled to vote at home, were entitled to vote here. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> He denounced any attempt to interfere with the free exercise of the right to vote, either by threats of personal violence or of other consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>In this section the <rs>Union</rs> men had nothing of that sort to fear, because they were numerically the strongest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He was not here to dictate to them how they should vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They had the right to vote for or against separation, and none had the right to hold them accountable for voting their honest convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>If any did attempt to prevent them, they should assert and maintain their rights at all hazards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> For himself, he had taken his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The noose was probably around his neck, but he was frank to declare himself a <hi rend="smallcaps">Rebel!</hi> He had counseled resistance to the invasive policy of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and that made him a Rebel, and if there was any punishment to follow it, he was willing to incur it; he did not seek to evade either the charge or the responsibility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> [The applause which followed this declaration of <persName n="Bell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Bell,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName> was so great that he could not, for a moment, proceed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Notwithstanding the eagerness of the <rs>North</rs> to engage in and prolong this war for military glory, he did not believe it would be of long duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He thought it would be ended in a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> had an interest in the matter, and they would not permit it to continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It was to their interest to favor a reconciliation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> He paid a high compliment to the brave young men who have marched from the <rs>South</rs> into <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He contrasted them with the <rs>Northern</rs> troops, and while he awarded courage to the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> troops, they were not composed of the best class of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> He would not debate the question whether the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> States had acted right in seceding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>He did not believe they had; but when <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> States had seceded and their people were unanimous, it was then a revolution, and the <name>Administration</name> had made a great mistake in attempting to coerce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>If the <rs>South</rs> seriously threatened to conquer the <rs>North</rs>, to put down trial by jury, freedom of the press and representative government, the contest might be for liberty; but, as this is not so, the introduction of such topics is mere rhetorical amplification. &#x0022;Can you subdue the revolted States?&#x0022; &#x0022;Of course we can,&#x0022; says <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Cassius,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Our honor and interest is to stand aloof from contests which in no way concern us: to be content with our own laws and liberties, without seeking to impose them upon others; <q>&#x0022;to seek peace and insure it,&#x0022;</q> and to leave those who take to the sword to fall by the sword.

<head>War Panics and panic-makers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> There is a law upon the statute books of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> against false rumors in time of war. It is to be found in <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Henning,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Henning,nomatch:0"><surname>Henning</surname></persName>.</hi> It is an old law, and still, we presume, in force; for it has never been and never ought to be repealed It denounces a heavy penalty against the disseminators of false intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The penalty could not well be too heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The man who catches up an idle rumor on the wing, and is coward or fool enough to mount horse and gallop through the country <q>&#x0022;on the foaming and panting steed,&#x0022;</q> spreading and magnifying the story, ought to be shot down as he flies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Even if the rumor be true, that is not the way to treat it. It should be communicated quietly to the authorities, and these should take such discreet measures as at once to guard against the threatening danger, and to secure the composure of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Panic often does more damage than an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It is infinitely more demoralizing; it is frequently more destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>In every community there are panic-makers by nature, who can't help getting frightened, and frightening everybody else, on the slightest provocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/><num value="1">One</num> of these panic-makers is worse than a squadron of the enemy's dragoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They will frighten more men out of the field than the dragoons could possibly disperse They will throw more old women into hysterics, they will cause more rushing to and fro of men, women, and boys, more slamming of doors, more breaking of windows, more petty accidents, and more universal destruction than an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>A real enemy can travel but a few miles a day, and can cover but a small belt of country; but panic spreads like a circle in the water, embracing the whole surface of the country, and traveling as many miles in a day as an enemy can travel in a fortnight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> The old law against the bearers of false rumors and the manufacturers of panic, was wise and needful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It ought to be revived and enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It would prove a wonderful corrective against the recurrence of these demoralizing, distracting, and often ridiculous concomitants of war. But there is another remedy for them which should not be neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>It is the free and prompt circulation of correct intelligence in regard to the movements of the public enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is well that the <rs>Government</rs> in very critical emergencies should have control of telegraphs and other agencies of information, but if Government withholds the advices it receives, and at the same time lays the ordinary channels of news under embargo, they at once surrender the community to the dominion of rumor and the remorseless sway of panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It is all a mistake, too, in public officers to publish only good news and with hold what is bad. Bad news travels in the atmosphere, and magnifies as it travels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The truth of bad news is less hurtful than exaggerations of it; and, as a measure of prudence, it is best to let the people have it. The more suspicion of the people that Government is not dealing fairly with them creates distrust, and prepares the public mind for panic and stampede. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> But it is only in very critical emergencies that any official interference should be ventured with the ordinary transmission of news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The press is the <q>&#x0022;<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> estate&#x0022;</q> of the present age. The community are accustomed to look to the press for early intelligence, and to hold it responsible for its accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The press has infinitely more at stake in its publication of news than any officer of Government can have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It has to endure the wrath of public opinion if it abuse its powers of disseminating intelligence, by putting forth that which is false and which leads to injurious consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>At the same time, it has the strongest possible incentives to industry and fidelity in its avocation, those of pecuniary reward and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It gains money by publishing correct news; it loses it by publishing spurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>This is the best of all guarantee on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It is better than the censorship of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It is better than a monopoly by Government officers of all authenticated intelligence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> We make these remarks in no spirit of criticism and cavil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We are willing that the legitimate province of the press shall be trenched upon in times of danger; but we take the liberty of expressing the deliberate judgment that, unless the public emergency be very critical, intelligence should be free to the press and the press free to lay it before the public. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> The public is never a coward when it is not treated as a coward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It can stand any amount of truth in the form of war intelligence; but if the truth is withheld, then its composure, reason, and manhood, is readily upset by idle rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The last <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> have been fruitful of evil and even ridiculous results consequent upon letting rumor loose upon the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Public curiosity in war times, like Nature, abhors a vacuum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>It must be satisfied by news of some sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>It truth is withheld, then in rushes rumor with her <num value="1000">thousand</num> false tongues, of which she is sure to make busy and hurtful use. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> We have never been of those who could see logic or justice in imputing to religion the faults and the sins of its disciples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>We should as soon think of doubting the glory of the sun when its beams are intercepted by a fog, or question its life and health-giving influences, because malaria and <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snakes</rs> come forth at its bidding, as deny the <name>Divine</name> origin of Christianity because the best of its disciples are frail and imperfect men, and some of them deliberate hypocrites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Indeed, this fact, as well as the general corruption of mankind, only confirm the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> account of human nature, which represents it as desperately wicked, and which gives us instances of the best characters sometimes yielding to temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>But the same book certainly recognizes a class of deliberate pretenders and hypocrites, and tells us that we may know men by their fruits, and describes these fruits in the <rs>Christian</rs> as peace, charity, forbearance, long suffering, &#x0026;c., whilst in the opposite they are hatred, variance, wrath, emulation, strife, &#x0026;c., of which we are told that they who do such things cannot inherit the kingdom of <hi rend="smallcaps"><name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</hi> Many graces are recounted in the <rs>Christian</rs> system, but we are told that Charity, or Love, is the greatest of all. <q>&#x0022;And now abideth Faith, Hope and Charity; but the greatest of these is Charity.&#x0022;</q> It is, indeed, the great Godlike grace, for it was the <rs>Charity</rs> or Love of <hi rend="smallcaps"><name n="God" type="God">God</name></hi> to man which led to the <rs>Divine Sacrifice</rs> of <persName n="His Son,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:His Son,nomatch:0"><surname>His Son</surname></persName>, and lies at the foundation of the whole <name>Christian</name> system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>And of all the virtues which that system enjoins, Forgiveness is the greatest.--Many virtues does it require,--humility, honesty, chastity, truth; but the forgiveness of enemies is prominent above them all, and is made the indispensable condition of man's forgiveness by <hi rend="smallcaps"><name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</hi> We can conceive of a Christian falling into great sin, and even denying his master, like <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName>;</hi> but it is impossible to conceive of any <name>Christian</name> man deliberately cultivating hatred towards another man, and especially towards another <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>These remarks are made to show that, in what we have to say of the <rs>Young Men</rs>'s Christian Associations of the <rs>North</rs>, we consider ourselves as speaking not of Christians, but of wicked pretenders to that holy name, as their own fruits do manifest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The spirit of <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> was always a spirit of hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It would rather <q>&#x0022;rule in hell than serve in Heaven,&#x0022;</q> and therefore it left <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>, under the plea of persecution; therefore it left <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>, under the pretence that the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> were too wicked to be its companions; therefore it persecuted to the death men of every religion in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, and therefore it is now trying to crush out slavery and the descendants of the <name>Cavaliers</name> in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The great, distinguishing, indispensable grace of charity was always as much lessened in the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> system as it was exalted in the <name>Gospel</name>, and whatever virtues have been ascribed by its adversaries to the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> character, the most fulsome and audacious of their panegyrists never yet claimed for them much love for anybody but themselves, or any forgiveness whatever for their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/> I was so near the scene of action that I could hear much that was said, and the bullets as they went whizzing through the trees in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Whatever their boasted courage may have been, they did not wish to provoke or stand another round from our brave riflemen, and <hi rend="italics">would</hi> not make another attack, but scattered, taking a round-about way back to their quarters. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> It is here reported that the enemy's attack upon our city will, in all probability, be made at <num value="3">three</num> different points; and while this movement is going on, likely a ship will attempt passage by our batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>This will be done not with a view to success, but to draw the attention of our troops from more important posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>But this is of little moment when it is remembered the number of forces we have guarding every point where an attack could be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>I regard the success of such a movement as impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>From recent facts we must either conclude that an early invasion of our soil will occur, or an entire relinquishment of any such idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>My ground for so believing is in the fact that <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> <persName n="Dornin,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00305" reg="mostcommon:Dornin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Dornin</surname></persName>, a day or <num value="2">two</num> ago, while <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for our city, but who stopped to pay a visit to her relation, <persName n="Pendergrast,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00306" reg="mostcommon:Pendergrast,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Com.</roleName> <surname>Pendergrast</surname></persName>, was persuaded by him not to come to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, if she valued her own life and the lives of her children, intimating that an early attack upon the city was strongly meditated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/> Confirming this, is a letter from <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, to a highly respectable gentleman of this city, imploring him for <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake to leave the place at once; that a bold attack would be shortly made to take it, and the city bombarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The letter throughout breathes an affecting tone, and is entitled to some thought, since there could be no object in the writer in thus urging upon the persons, who were relatives, the propriety of leaving, unless an attack was expected. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/> There was a hurrying toward the side of the vessel, and the few friends who had come to see me off, crossed the narrow plank which was the last link between me and the home I had never left before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>My eyes were blurred by something or other, and I could only see kind faces and waving handkerchiefs through a kind of mist, as the gallant ship was towed slowly from the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>The narrow strip of water between the green piles and the stout ribs of our brave craft gradually widened, and before long the little knot of spectators on the wharf dwindled into a mere black speck, and presently was lost to sight altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>The countless isles of <placeName key="tgn,1114422" n="1.000 1" reg="boston harbor, massachusetts, united states">Boston harbor</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2335337" n="1.000 1" reg="fort independence, massachusetts">fort Independence</placeName>, <placeName reg="Point Shirley, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2660068">Point Shirley</placeName>, and all, glided past on either hand, and the long, ground-swell of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic Ocean</placeName> began to destroy the horizontal position of the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>We had parted company with our tow-boat sometime before, and now the fresh breeze carried us along swiftly through the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>After a while the last low line upon the horizon had vanished, and we were fairly out at sea. I leaned over the stern, and listlessly gazed at the long wake behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>I tried to fancy it a bridge for my thoughts to travel over, back to the kind hearth I had left many years; and I was lost in idle reverie, when a heavy hand was laid on my shoulder, and a rough voice said to me cheerily: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, <persName n="Osborne,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00414" reg="mostcommon:Osborne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Osborne</surname></persName>, are you thinking of the sweetheart you have left behind?&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/> <q>&#x0022;Hardly, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>.&#x0022;</q> I answered, rousing myself from the lazy attitude I had previously assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/><q>&#x0022;That is a luxury I do not indulge in; it costs more than smoking.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/> <q>&#x0022;He calls himself Rob Eichborn; guess he answers to the name of Red Rob. I picked him up on the <rs type="place">Wharf</rs>, loafing; he's a smart hand, and I'll take the sulks out of him, if he tries 'em on me.&#x0022;</q> With these words, <persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00415" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> went to give some orders, and left me on the quarter-deck alone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/> Several hours had elapsed since we left the harbor, and the sun was about half an hour high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>I sat quietly watching the clouds, as they mirrored their bright faces in the water, until I had again nearly lost myself in reverie, when I suddenly heard loud voices on the deck below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>I hastily turned my head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/> <q>&#x0022;Hit him again, hit him again!&#x0022;</q> cried half a dozen sailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/><q>&#x0022;Smash his mug for him, Rob!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/> The tall sailor I had spoken of was standing in the midst of a little crowd and looking savagely at another before him, whose bleeding check bore witness to some severe blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The latter shrunk back when he saw all against him, and said, looking at his antagonist: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/> &#x0022;I ben't a feared on ye, big as ye be; but it's mean to hit a feller when he didn't expect it.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/> <q>&#x0022;Course you!&#x0022;</q> growled Rob. drawing a step nearer, with all the hate of a fiend in his dark eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/><q>&#x0022;I'll kill you if you speak another word.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/> <q>&#x0022;Stop!&#x0022;</q> roared the <rs>Captain</rs>, rushing up from the cabin and thrusting his burly form through the group, <q>&#x0022;who struck him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>You? Lash him to the mainmast, boys, and give him a round dozen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Quick!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/> <q>&#x0022;Twan't my fault, capten, he--&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/> <q>&#x0022;Silence!&#x0022;</q> thundered the other; <q>&#x0022;what do I care whose fault it was?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>You struck him, and you shall smart for it. If he struck you, I'll give him a dozen afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Off with your jacket, or I'll rip it off your back!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/> Rob stepped back a few steps and laid his hand on the knife which every sailor wears in his girdle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> promptly drew a pistol from his breast-pocket and walked straight up to the exasperated tar, levelled it at his head, and said in a low, deliberate tone: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/> &#x0022;Throw that knife overboard, or I will shoot you in <measure n="5seconds" type="date">five seconds</measure>!&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/> Rob hesitated; but he saw something he did not like in his officer's face, and sullenly complied with the command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/> <q>&#x0022;Take off your jacket!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/> He obeyed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/> <q>&#x0022;Take off your shirt?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/> This was done likewise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/> <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Andrews,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00416" reg="mostcommon:Andrews,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Andrews</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mate, who had just appeared from the cabin, <q> &#x0022;see this fellow lashed to the mast at once.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/> The mate motioned to <num value="2">two</num> of the awe-struck by standers, and the refractory sailor was speedily confined, presenting his bare back for his punishment, without making any resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> then took a rope's end, and inflicted <num value="24">two dozen</num> severe blows, which the culprit received without wincing or manifesting the slightest sign of sensibility to the intense suffering he must have experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>As soon as he had done, he ordered the prisoner to be released, and sent for the cook to dress his wounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/><persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00417" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> then turned toward the quarter deck, and as he approached me, I saw Rob send a glance of hatred and lost for revenge after him, that absolutely curdled the blood in my veins with horror. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/> <q>&#x0022;Ugly piece of business, <persName n="Osborne,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00418" reg="mostcommon:Osborne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Osborne</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> he remarked, as he resumed the coat he had thrown off in order the better to administer the punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/><q>&#x0022;I'm glad its through with.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/> <q>&#x0022;I wish I felt sure it <hi rend="italics">were</hi> through with,&#x0022;</q> was my emphatic reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/> <q>&#x0022;Eh?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>What's the dence to pay now, I should like to know?&#x0022;</q> exclaimed he, pausing in his operation, and standing with his coat half on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/> <q>&#x0022;Simply this,&#x0022;</q> I answered, <q>&#x0022;that fellow Rob owes you a grudge, and it is easy to see, he will not be quick to forget it. Just now he cast Satan's own love glance after you, and I am believer enough in physiognomy to put no faith in the rascal's honesty or magnanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>There is dangerous blood under his hide, depend upon it, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/> <q>&#x0022;Pooh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>nonsense!&#x0022;</q> rejoined he, with a skeptical laugh, <q>&#x0022;don't come your land-lubber tricks over an old salt, <persName n="Osborne,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00419" reg="mostcommon:Osborne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Osborne</surname></persName>.--You can't gammon me with your &mdash; ognomies and &mdash; ologies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>I have handled tougher cases than his, take my word for it; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of insubordination will put him in irons, and if that won't do, announce of lead shall, that's all&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/> By this time, the sun had set and twilight was rapidly deepening into night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>It was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night at sea, and as I followed the <rs>Captain</rs> into the cabin, the contrast between my present quarters and the snug home I had deserted impressed itself with renewed force on my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>To increase my uneasiness, I could not divest myself of the idea that mischief was brewing in the forecastle; for I knew that a billious temperament like Rob's never ceased active hostilities because of a single rebuff. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/> With a slender prospect of escaping the nightmare, at an early hour I retired into my berth, and soon fell into a light sleep, leaving the <rs>Captain</rs> busy at the table, recording his observations in the log-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>When I awoke again the cabin was dark, and the only sound audible was the dull splashing of the waves against the side of the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>Although my mind was troubled and restless, the continual murmur before long lulled me again to sleep, and my slumbers were unbroken until I was roused by the call to breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>As I walked across the floor, my foot struck against something hard, and stooping down to pick it up, I perceived a tin tobacco box, containing enough to fill half a dozen pipes, and bearing on the lid the initials <q>&#x0022;R. E.,&#x0022;</q> roughly scratched with a jack-knife or a nail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>As they were neither the initials of the <rs>Captain</rs> nor the <num value="2">two</num> mates who slept in the cabin, I was somewhat puzzled at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but a sudden thought flashed across my mind, which made me start as if stung by a viper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>Without delay I went to <persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00420" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, whom I found at the compass on the quarter deck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/> <q>&#x0022;Good morning, <persName n="Osborne,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00421" reg="mostcommon:Osborne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Osborne</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> said he, without looking up. <q>&#x0022;Stiff breeze &mdash; splendid weather.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/> I made no answer, but handed him the box. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/> <q>&#x0022;Well?&#x0022;</q> said he, looking at me for an explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/><q>&#x0022;What's this?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/> <q>&#x0022;Whose initials are those?&#x0022;</q> I answered, pointing to the lid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/> <q>&#x0022;R. E.,&#x0022;</q> said he, musing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/><q>&#x0022;O, I know &mdash; <persName n="Eichborn,,Robert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00422" reg="default:Eichborn,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Eichborn</surname></persName>, of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>I'll give it to him. Where did you find it?&#x0022;</q> And he resumed his observations with the compass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/> <q>&#x0022;In the cabin, just now,&#x0022;</q> I replied significantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/> <q>&#x0022;The deuce you did,&#x0022;</q> he exclaimed, hastily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/><q>&#x0022;How came it there, eh? &#x0022;</q> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/> <q>&#x0022;My advice is, to find out forthwith,&#x0022;</q> said I, <q>&#x0022;that is, if you have half the distrust of the villain I have.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/> Without another word, the <rs>Captain</rs> strode toward the gangway, and entered the cabin; I followed close at his heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>He approached a large chest in <num value="1">one</num> corner, and fumbled in his pocket for his keys; they were gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>Going to the gangway again, he said to the sailor whose check had been bloodied yesterday: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/> <q>&#x0022;Tell the carpenter to come here, Morphy.&#x0022;</q> And as the fellow started to obey, he added; <q>&#x0022;Tell him to bring his axe.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/> Presently the carpenter appeared, as ordered, bearing his axe over his shoulder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/> <q>&#x0022;Split open that chest,&#x0022;</q> said the <rs>Captain</rs>, briefly pointing to the article in question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/> <num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> blows sufficed to break the cover, and the <rs>Captain</rs> immediately ransacked the contents of the chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>After a moment's examination, he rose up, muttering through his shut teeth: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/> <q>&#x0022;Just as I expected, <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00423" reg="nearbymention:Smith,William,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> said he, turning sharply upon the carpenter, and fixing his keen eyes on the man's face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/><q>&#x0022;Do you know where those pistols and cutlasses are?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/> The man stammered out a denial, and was evidently confused, at the same time edging his way toward the door of the cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/><persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00424" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> sprang forward and collared him, at the same time holding a pistol within <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> of his eyes, and saying to me, in a firm, collected tone: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/> <q>&#x0022;Be so kind as to lock that door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Now, <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00425" reg="nearbymention:Smith,William,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> bringing the pistol so near the fellow's face as almost to touch it, <q>&#x0022;tell me all about this matter, or your life is not worth an old cud.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Let me see,&#x0022;</q> he said, musing a few moments, <q>&#x0022;how to do it, that's the question &mdash; ha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>I have it.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/> He motioned me to follow him, and went on deck, turning the key of the cabin door without being observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>He whispered a few words to me hurriedly, and then shouted to Rob, who was belaying a rope on the other side of the ship: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/> <q>&#x0022;Call all bands to grog, Etchborn, and send me the mates.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/> The man shot a slide glance at the <rs>Captain</rs>; but, seeing no sign of suspicion in his imperturbable features, he obeyed, and in a few moments the whole crew were assembled on deck to receive the coveted ration of grog.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>I at once stole toward the forecastle, entered it and hastily ransacking it, discovering the pistols and cutlasses hidden under some discarded sail cloth in a corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>I plunged the pistols in a bucket of water, wiped them dry outside and replaced them; then, gathering the cutlasses in my arms, I started to fling them over the ship's side; but, as I reached the door, I was suddenly confronted by <num value="1">one</num> of the mutineers, who instantly divined my object and struck at me with a marline spike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>With <num value="1">one</num> of the cut-lasses, however, I dealt him a blow over the head which laid him prostrate; and with a quick spring I leaped from the forecastle, and casting the weapons overboard, retaining only the <num value="1">one</num> I had just used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>The splash attracted the attention of the others, who were drinking their grog; the whole thing had been done in a couple of minutes, and before the mutineers had guessed the truth, I had regained the <rs>Captain</rs>'s side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/> He looked at me inquiringly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>I nodded.--At a glance I perceived he had contrived to warn the mates, and <persName n="Murphy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00434" reg="mostcommon:Murphy,nomatch:0"><surname>Murphy</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dawson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00435" reg="mostcommon:Dawson,nomatch:0"><surname>Dawson</surname></persName>, for they all stood near him. I knew the <num value="2">two</num> former always went armed, but the <num value="2">two</num> latter, I feared, were unprepared for the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>But the sharp eyes of Red Rob had noticed the telegraphic communication between the <rs>Captain</rs> and myself; coupling the splash in the water with my appearance near the forecastle, he undoubtedly conjectured my errand in the quarters appropriated to sailors before the mast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>He saw his own dilemma; his plot was known before he was ready to carry it into execution; but with the bold desperation of the practised ruffian, he resolved to strike the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow himself.--Drawing his own pistol, therefore, he aimed it at the <rs type="place">Captain's head</rs> with a fiendish expression on his features, and pulled the trigger, shouting at the same time: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/> <q>&#x0022;Now's your time, boys, Down with 'em!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/> In an instant the deck was in an uproar.--Some of the mutineers had, like their ringleader, taken the precaution to carry their arms with them, and our little group, therefore, was in danger of being overborne and annihilated by numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>Rob's shot had apparently missed of its desired effect, for the <rs>Captain</rs> was in the thickest of the fray, and brought down <num value="3">three</num> of the rebels himself.--But I had little time to make observations, for a couple of fellows attacked me, and just as I had struck <num value="1">one</num> down with my cutlass (which I had concealed under my coat until the conflict began,) the other snapped his pistol close to my ear. I was half stunned by the report, but his aim had miscarried, and the ball only grazed the back of my head; rallying almost instantaneously, I returned the compliment by sending a ball from my own revolver through his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>Being for a moment freed, therefore, from immediate attack, I cast my glance toward the <rs>Captain</rs> and saw his face livid and discolored with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>With a cocked pistol in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and supporting himself against the mast with the other, he waited the attack of the exulting Rob, who was approaching him with a long knife, with which he had just stabbed <persName n="Murphy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00436" reg="mostcommon:Murphy,nomatch:0"><surname>Murphy</surname></persName> to the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>When the bloody villain was within a yard, he raised his arm hastily and fired; at the same time losing his hold of the mast and falling upon the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>The other combatants stood still and ceased fighting to watch the result; Rob staggered back, but quietly recovering himself, sprang toward the prostrate <rs>Captain</rs>, when I dashed upon him and grappled him in my arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>A desperate struggle followed; we fell heavily, I uppermost, within a few feet of the <rs>Captain</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>Instead, however, of striving to stab me with his dirk, he rolled over with a mighty effort and struck at the <rs>Captain</rs> by his side; the long blade was driven a full inch and <num value="0.5">a half</num> into the planks of the deck, and, just missing the <rs>Captain</rs>'s body, stuck quivering beside it. Maddened beyond control by such infernal rancor, the <persName n="Andrews,Mate,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00437" reg="mostcommon:Andrews,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mate">mate</roleName> <surname>Andrews</surname></persName> levelled his pistol at the ruffian's head, and the sharp report was followed by a quick, convulsive quiver of his whole body; then he lay stone dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/> The rest of the mutineers, many of whom had tried to use the dampened pistols and had been overcome, laid down their arms and submitted, after losing <num value="6">six</num> of their number, killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/><persName n="Murphy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00438" reg="mostcommon:Murphy,nomatch:0"><surname>Murphy</surname></persName> was the only <num value="1">one</num> of our side who had been killed, but the <rs>Captain</rs> lay unable to rise, with a mingled stream of blood and froth slowly oozing from his mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>I knelt down and asked if he was much hurt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/> <q>&#x0022;Enough to settle my hash, I'm afraid,&#x0022;</q> was his answer, as he gasped for breath.--<q>&#x0022;Stop this wound in my side, or I shall bleed to death.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/> We tore off his shirt and staunched a pistol wound in his left side; but when we tried to lift him and carry him into the cabin, a gush of blood burst from his mouth, and we laid him down again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/> <q>&#x0022;No use,&#x0022;</q> said he, faintly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/><q>&#x0022;I'm done for. Poor little <persName n="Nelly,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00439" reg="mostcommon:Nelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelly</surname></persName>, she'll break her heart!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>Get me some water, somebody, will you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>That rascal was too true a shot--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> forgive us all; she'll want to know all about it; and you'll tell her I thought of her last of all, <persName n="Osborne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00440" reg="mostcommon:Osborne,nomatch:0"><surname>Osborne</surname></persName>?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/> The survivors on both sides were heartily sick of mutual murder; and moreover there were hardly hands enough to manage the ship, so that none could be spared to be in irons.
