<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The Revolutionary Congress &mdash; or, rather, the several congresses of '<num value="76">76</num>--must have been a rare body of men.--They had been produced by the times upon which their lot had been cast, and they were up to the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They suffered no catastrophe, however disastrous; no danger, however imminent; no emergency, however pressing; no crisis, however imminent, to oppress them, or to swerve them, for <num value="1">one</num> moment, from the clear line of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Far from partaking of those momentary fits of despondency which sometimes, very naturally, fell like a shower bath upon the enthusiasm of the people, or that far more dangerous apathy, which was frequently the successor to violent and long-continued exertion, they were always present to cheer, to exhort, to stimulate, by every appliance within the reach of strong common sense and unabated courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Driven, occasionally, from <num value="1">one</num> place of session to another, they never lost their equanimity, and never, for an instant, gave way to doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>There was no occasion to which they were not equal, no high resolve to the level of which they were not capable of rising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They understood thoroughly the circumstances in which they were placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Revolutionary men in a revolutionary era, they felt and understood their position; and, laying aside the insane common-place of every-day, peaceful life, they adopted the bold spirit and high action proper to the day. They had, fortunately, never been politicians after the fashion of the days which have just passed under the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They had never been taught that a party victory is the highest achievement of statesmanship, and that statesmanship consists in obtaining a victory at the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They were the creatures of the <name>Revolution</name>, as the salamander is the creature of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They were generated in that atmosphere &mdash; they imbibed it from their political infancy &mdash; they lived in it as their natural element &mdash; no change that it brought, how startling soever it might appear to ordinary minds, could shake their constancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They had pledged to <num value="1">one</num> another &#x0022;their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor,&#x0022; that they would carry that thing through; and when they had once made their pledge, they proceeded to redeem it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Would to Heaven the <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName> had inherited but a portion of the spirit of these grand old patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But we look for it in vain.--Our armies have suffered disaster and defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A mighty host is encompassed within a few miles of the city &mdash; the thunder of his batteries shakes the walls of the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He does not hesitate to proclaim that it is his intention to enslave, or to extirpate, the whole race, of which we are part and parcel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our Congress is in session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Bills of the most urgent necessity are before it &mdash; bills vital to our Constitution and our country &mdash; bills upon the passage of which depend our <hi rend="italics">status</hi> as freemen or slaves, probably for centuries to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We are in the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> week of the session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The enemy is prosecuting his enterprises throughout the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He allows our armies no rest, day or night; and yet not <num value="1">one</num> single step has been taken by our legislators for the renovation of our armies, for the amelioration of our currency; for the restoration of confidence to our people, for any object whatever that can have the remotest bearing upon our defence against the vengeance of our implacable enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They spend their time in talking, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> just as if the old days of log cabins and hard cider were here again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They appear to have fallen asleep under the administration of <persName n="Buren,,Martin,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="expanded:Buren,Martin,,,"><foreName>Martin</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName>, and never to have become thoroughly awake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>And while they are postponing every bill that can be useful in this emergency, the enemy is raising heaven and earth to recruit his armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The disasters which we have suffered of late are not only not irreparable, but they are not so great as others we have suffered on other occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But the people have been more depressed by them than they ever were before, because they had been flattered with hopes of peace by persons who well knew that there could be no peace short of submission and enslavement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The fit of depression has been longer and more violent than formerly, because they see that Congress to which they naturally turn for encouragement trifling on the very edge of the abyss with the reckless disregard of their situation which prompts sailors, when the ship is about to go down, to break open the spirit room and drown their fears in liquor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They see little hope in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Congress is, in fact, assisting the enemy by encouraging the disposition to croak, which seems to have beset the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A little prompt action, a slight display of resolution, a few words to keep up the confidence of the people, would work wonders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Cannot the <rs>Congress</rs> arouse itself and become equal to this task? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> If the miserable croakers who, within the last <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, have been converting <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> into a perfect Frog-<persName n="Pond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pond,nomatch:0"><surname>Pond</surname></persName>, will take the trouble to read <persName n="Pollard,Mister,E.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="expanded:Pollard,Edward,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName>'s &#x0022;Results of <measure n="10Months" type="date">Ten Months</measure> Observation in the <rs>Enemy</rs>'s Country,&#x0022; published in the <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, they would probably feel ashamed of their unmanly fears, if they have not altogether lost the power of blushing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Among a great many things of much interest, he tells us that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are on the point of exhaustion in the recruiting business &mdash; that their last draft of <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> brought in but <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num>--that the larger portion of recruits since <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s proclamation has been made of negroes &mdash; that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, in the lines of which he spent <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure>, is composed of negroes, in the proportion of <num value="3">three</num> negroes to <num value="1">one</num> white man &mdash; that the next draft will fail more signally than any which have preceded it &mdash; that a conscription must necessarily be resorted to &mdash; and that <hi rend="italics">then</hi> the war must break down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Such, he says, is the universal belief in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>All parties agree that the only hope of subduing the <rs>South</rs> lies in the desire of the <rs>South</rs> to get rid of the war, which they all hope will lead to its submission before it becomes necessary to enforce a conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The vote of all the armies around <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in the <name>Presidential</name> election was but <num value="18000">eighteen thousand</num>, there being only that number of native-born or naturalized white men in it; an over whelming proof of the utter distaste the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have for campaigning, and an index of the trouble which a conscription, calling for all classes, is sure to produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But before that time, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> hope the <rs>Confederates</rs> will submit &mdash; croaking and peace resolutions in this quarter having induced them to believe that we are on the point of caving in. In these circumstances, <persName n="Pollard,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,E.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName> thinks it far more important than anything else to convince the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that our resolution is not changed, and that our courage is still unbroken; for, notwithstanding the resistance of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, certain of them still really are, or, at least, affect to be, unconvinced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> That these observations of <persName n="Pollard,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,E.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName> are accurate, and that they lead him to a correct conclusion, there cannot be the shadow of a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is assuredly convinced that he has run nearly the length of his tether, and that he can no longer recruit his armies without resorting to a <orgName n="General Conscription" type="misc">general conscription</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>When that comes, he knows it may break the back of the war. Nor is that all. The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> tells us that, if the war continues <num value="1">one</num> year longer, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must become bankrupt, and suspend it through sheer exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><persName n="Pollard,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,E.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName> says there is <num value="1">one</num> question in <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> everybody's mouth at the <rs>North</rs>, and that is: Have the <rs>South</rs> the resolution to hold out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>And the answer to that question is more important to the people at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> than would be plans of every fortification held by the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>And it is at such a time &mdash; when the enemy has nearly gone the full extent he can possibly go &mdash; when peace is almost within our grasp &mdash; that the army of croakers is spreading over our country, like the frogs, lice and locusts of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, defiling and debasing everything they touch, and poisoning the very atmosphere with their pestilential breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Why, the very fact of his allowing old <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Blair,nomatch:0"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> to come here is proof positive that he is in a state of extreme anxiety, and ought to encourage our people to the utmost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> These croakers are already making themselves ready for submission.--Things, they say, will not be half so bad as we apprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Negro emancipation will not take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The same power that has already emancipated and made soldiers of <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> slaves, where there is a large army opposing them, will become moderate as soon as that army shall have been disbanded and our means of resistance annihilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Contrary to every example presented by history, as well as to common sense, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, as soon as they are absolute masters, will become moderate and merciful; and in this hope we are called on to throw away our arms and submit!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We are to believe that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nature is capable of a magnanimity of which human nature, in no other shape, was ever before capable.--So the croakers tell us, and the <rs>Confederates</rs> are expected to believe it. If they really believe it themselves, they are greater fools than we took them for. But let them not lay the flattering unction to their souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><persName n="Pollard,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Pollard,E.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName> has been among them down below <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and he has had an opportunity of hearing what fate they design for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in general, and what for <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>For <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, they mean to divide it into <num value="100">hundred</num>-acre farms, and call in the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation to share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The <rs type="place">Valley</rs> especially is an object of desire with this self-denying race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The measure that has been dealt out to the meek and submissive <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> is no criterion to judge of the vengeance reserved for <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The croakers may croak submission, but they cannot save their tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Everything worth stealing is to be appropriated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>They vainly imagined that by enlisting in the crusade of coercion they were subserving the interests of stability, order and permanent peace and security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>But these cardinal objects of good government are not to be gained by placing power in the hands of fanatics, who have dethroned reason, who take counsel only of their passions and imaginations, and whose whole history, from the origin of the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> sent in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, proves that they are as restless and insubordinate when not themselves the rulers as they are tyrannical and remorseless when they hold the reins; that they are chronic enemies of all authority except their own; social disorganizers, who will either rule or ruin; monomaniacs, whose brains are incapable of holding more than <num value="1">one</num> idea at a time, and who, as fast as the idea is exploded, supply its place with another, equally lunatic and impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time it is prelacy; at another, Romanism; at another, royalty; at another, witchcraft; at another, teetotalism; and at another, slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The circumstances under which the <rs>Greyhound</rs> was captured are peculiar, and involve a question of the most obvious interest and gravest import to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government and to the rights of property in her subjects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> The <rs>Greyhound</rs> was, in good faith, and in all respects, a British vessel, and had been chartered at <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName> to take out from the port of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> certain private cotton purchased and paid for by subjects of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and held exclusively on their own account Not <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of this cotton belonged to any citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; nor did any such citizen have any interest whatever in the vessel or her venture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Your Lordship will be easily able to determine from the ship's papers, and all other circumstances, that the nationality of the <rs>Greyhound</rs> was not a disguise &mdash; an adopted convenience for running the blockade &mdash; but was in all respects a true and unaffected claim on the part of her owners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> At the time of the capture of the <rs>Greyhound</rs>, on the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="10">10th instant</day></dateStruct>, she was in lat. <num value="33">33</num> degs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>She had passed out to sea from the port of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> without seeing a Federal cruiser, and without any visible evidence of a blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>But even if that blockade had existed, and was something more than a vicious fiction, by which Federal cruisers, instead of picketing the coast, are permitted to take easy prizes on the high seas, I submit to your Lordship that the <rs>Greyhound</rs>, having once passed out the territorial limit, and flying the <rs>British</rs> flag, not for the purposes of concealment, but by clear title of right, could not be outlawed on the high seas, and took the risks of blockade only within the territorial jurisdiction claimed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Any other rule would extend the jurisdiction of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> over the high seas, and the flag of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government, carried there by a clear title of right, could not be outlawed on the high seas, and took the risks of blockade only within the territorial jurisdiction claimed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Any other rule would extend the jurisdiction of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> over the high seas, and the flag of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government, carried there by a clear title in the vessel to fly it, would afford no protection. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> As another circumstance of illegality in the capture of the <rs>Greyhound</rs> &mdash; indeed, I may say as <num value="1">one</num> of wholly unnecessary indignity &mdash; I have further to state to your Lordship, that when the vessel had been brought to <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, the <rs>Commodore</rs> present, the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs> commanding the <orgName n="Federal Squadron" type="squadron">Federal squadron</orgName>, commanded the <rs>British</rs> flag on my vessel to be hauled down, and the <rs>Federal</rs> flag to be hoisted in its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>There is certainly no shadow of right for such a proceeding until the vessel is condemned in due course of law; and of the spirit of an act, where the law and the rule of propriety which it equally offends are both so plain, your Lordship will doubtless have no difficulty in judging. </p>

I desire to put the question to your Lordship, if the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 7" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> can so change its tactics of blockade as to omit an efficient guard of the coast and take up vessels which have come out of Confederate ports by fast-sailing cruisers on the ocean highway; for such I was informed, by an officer of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Connecticut</rs>, was the recently adopted and easy plan of taking prizes, the fruits of which your Lordship may have observed in the capture of <num value="4">four</num> vessels as prizes in <hi rend="italics">a single week,</hi> each taken far out on the high seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Whilst they admit a contraband of war, by enumerating its articles, and the effect of a real blockade by defining it, in no instance do they affirm or imply a right in any sovereign <hi rend="italics">to enforce his claims to the allegiance of his subjects on board neutral vessels on the high seas;</hi> on the contrary, whenever a belligerent claim against persons on board a neutral vessel is referred to in treaties, <hi rend="italics">enemies in military service alone</hi> are excepted from the general immunity of persons in that situation; and this exception confirms the immunity of those who are not included in it. * * * If <hi rend="italics">the law of allegiance, which is a municipal law, </hi> be in force at all on the high seas on board foreign vessels, it must be so at all times there, as it is within its acknowledged sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>If the reason alleged for it be good in time of war, namely, that the sovereign has then a right to the service of all his subjects, it must be good at all times, because he has the same right to their service. * * * Taking reason and justice for the tests of this practice, it is peculiarly indefensible, because it deprives the dearest lights of persons of a regular trial, to which the most inconsiderable article of property captured on the high seas is entitled, and leaves their destiny to the will of an officer.&#x0022; (Am.
