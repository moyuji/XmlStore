<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> Almost all men in this country, and in any country where freedom of thought is tolerated, attach themselves to political parties, and it is but ordinary charity to attribute this to the fact that in so attaching himself to a party which his judgment prefers, the citizens believe he thereby promotes the best interests of the whole country. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> The history of this great State--the renown of those great men who have stood here, and spoken here, and been heard here, all crowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink from any attempt to address you.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> You have invited and received me without distinction of party, and I cannot for a moment suppose that this has been done in any considerable degree with reference to my personal services, but that it is done in so far as I am regarded at this time as the representative of the majority of this great nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> I doubt not that this is the truth, and the whole truth of the case, and this is as it should be. It is much more gratifying to me that this reception has been given to me as the representative of a free people, than it could possibly be if tendered to me as an evidence of devotion to me or any <num value="1">one</num> man personally. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> And now I think it were more fitting that I should close these hasty remarks.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> You have generously tendered me the support, the united support, of the great Empire State in behalf of the nation &mdash; in behalf of the present and future nation &mdash; in behalf of civil and religious liberty for all time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Most heartily do I thank you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> I do not propose to enter into explanation of any particular line of policy as to our present difficulties to be adopted by the incoming administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I deem it but just to you, to myself, to all, that I should see everything &mdash; that I should hear everything &mdash; that I should have every light that can be brought within my reach, that in order when I do so speak I shall have enjoyed every opportunity to take a correct and true ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> For this reason I do not propose at this time to speak of the policy of the government, but <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> when the time comes I shall speak and decide as well as I am able for the good of the present and the future of this country &mdash; for the good of the <num value="1">one</num> and the other, and of all sections &mdash; for the good both of the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>[Rounds of applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> In the meantime, if we have patience, if we restrain ourselves, if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion, I still have confidence that the <rs>Almighty Maker</rs> of the universe will, through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through this as He has through all other difficulties of our country, and relying on him, I again thank you for this generous reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/> <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>--The most populous and by far the most potent of the <name>States</name> of our late Confederacy has, for years, proclaimed that the convention between the slaveholders and non- slaveholders is a contest for life and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>This is the repeated decree of a State containing <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of people and having the command of <num value="4">four</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of the commerce of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/> The people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> being a portion of those <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of people, had only to ask themselves, is our existence worth a struggle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Their answer has been submitted to you in the form of an ordinance of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>The speaker then went on to say that be was before him men who had observed all the records of human life, and many who had been the chief actors in some of its greatest scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>He asked them if they could offer an example like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has <num value="300000">300,000</num> citizens and <num value="400000">400,000</num> slaves; the former depend on the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/><num value="20000000">Twenty millions</num>, with a strong government, decree the extermination of these <num value="400000">400,000</num>--and then, he asked, is liberty or life worth preserving? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/> He had thus very rapidly endeavored to group together the causes which induced the action of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>--though he had not given a history of half the aggressions of the <rs>North</rs> in this Republic; for from the accession of the younger <rs>Adams</rs> to this hour, they had manifested a firm purpose, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to restrict the <rs>Southern States</rs> within a line which they prescribed, and then subsidize them to destroy them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>They were baffled in <num value="1">one</num> course of this; but with that untiring activity, which they possess, they turned to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>They still held on with the fierce grip of avarice &mdash; with the mad rage of fanaticism &mdash; till it has pleased <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to curse them with a triumph which has plunged the country into civil war. and destroyed the fairest temple of Liberty ever reared by the hands of man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/> He then presented the other side of the picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>For <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> by labor and protest, by prayer and warning, and by every attempt and energy which she could bring to bear, had his State been endeavoring to avert this catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>In the <orgName n="Federal Legislature" type="legislature">Federal Legislature</orgName> she has given to this purpose all her intelligence, patriotism and virtue, and that she had all these to give is in proof, because that marble (pointing to the bust of <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00501" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>) sits in the hall where the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Convention of Virginia</orgName> is consulting upon her honor and her rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> Seeing the waves raging and the storm rising, a year ago she sends here a grave <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> to consult with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> upon measures of protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>[Here he read from the <name>Journal</name> of the <orgName n="South Carolina Legislature" type="legislature">South Carolina Legislature</orgName> the preamble and resolution adopted for the purpose of addressing an appeal to the slaveholding States to concert measures of united action, and sending a special <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to express her earnest desire to unite in measures for common defence.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> This was a year ago. Failing in that purpose, the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, joined the political organizations of the day, still in the hope of averting the catastrophe, and cast her vote for the candidate whom she thought best calculated to promote the welfare of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>But again failing she then, quietly and unostentatiously, and without clamor &mdash; having previously asked her sister States especially <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, to unite with her &mdash; passed this act in a few simple words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>[He then read the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> Ordinance of Secession.] Still she was not fully satisfied, for she still asked counsel and sympathy, and, therefore, he was here to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/> Notwithstanding all the wrongs which he had endeavored to group before his hearers, his State (he proceeded) throughout the country and throughout Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>has been charged with rash precipitancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Was it rash precipitancy to step out of the pathway when you heard the crash of the falling avalanche?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Was it rash precipitancy to seek a shelter when you heard the hissing of the coming tempest and saw the storm cloud close down upon you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Was it rash precipitancy to raise your hands to protect your heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>[Applause.]--Never since Liberty came to be an institution among men, have people borne more patiently, forborne more patiently, than the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> with their relations is of confederation with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>As long as it wore the form of silly fanaticism or prurient philanthropy, we did not complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>As long as we submitted to partial taxation, save with <num value="1">one</num> convulsive struggle we bore it patiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Even the violations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the robbery of our property, the murder of our citizens, and every species of fraud, all were borne, and we continued to give them our blood and our treasure to build up the grand edifice and maintain the power of that Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>When all that mad fanaticism could invent was hurled against us, we gave them our blood and sweat, offered them our hands and called them brothers.--This was no fancy picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> who heard him could attest its truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>But when at last the made fanaticism, in its thirst for rapine, had seized the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself and distorted it to ensure our ruin, then to delay longer seemed to us not only base cowardice, but absolute fatuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>[Applause.] In <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, at least, we felt that if a son of a <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> sire could give counsel to such submission as this, there was not a bill from <placeName key="tgn,7014152" n="1.000 7" reg="eutaw, greene, alabama">Eutaw</placeName> to the <name>Cowpens</name> but would have fallen to crush him for his base ingratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>[Renewed applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/> He had referred particularly to his State, because she was much spoken of, though not much praised in her career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>He was here as a Commissioner from those people &mdash; certainly not as their eulogist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>They had sent him here because he had always with some pride claimed to have sprung from this soil, and because they thought he would tell a plain story of their wrongs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> Never had a mighty drama been opened with purer moral sublimity than had been manifested in this revolution in which we were now engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Scarcely had the decree of our subjection been borne to their ears on the <rs>Northern</rs> breeze, when, as if from the very caverns of the earth, was heard the voice of the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, shouting back &#x0022;Resistance to the <name>Death</name>! &#x0022; The Legislature caught that spirit, and with <num value="1">one</num> voice only proclaimed &#x0022;Resistance to the death!&#x0022; The people of the <rs>State</rs> in sovereign counsel, as you are now, with <num value="1">one</num> voice, and <num value="1">one</num> only, ordained &#x0022;Resistance to the death!&#x0022;And now there is not in the borders of that little State, a man from <num value="16">16</num> to <num value="60">60</num>, who is not armed and ready for &#x0022;Resistance to the death!&#x0022; [Applause.] We are very small &mdash; we are very, very weak; but if now or in after time that fiery storm shall fall and consume us; if, then, the pilgrim of Liberty from this land shall search beneath the ruins of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, he shall find the sentinel standing at the sea-gate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> The speaker prayed his hearers not to believe or be persuaded that in taking the step of secession, his people had been forgetful of those things so cherished here; forgetful of the great and hallowed past, or reckless of their duty as citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>It is that they have a memory of the greatness of the past that has nerved their arms to this task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>They had paused and raised the curtain with their own hands, and gazed back upon the great and hallowed past &mdash; upon that temple in which they had thought Liberty would forever find a shrine; that temple which <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00502" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> and his great compatriots had built for them and their children to dwell in forever &mdash; that temple which they had deemed the <name>Palladium</name> of human right; that refuge of the patriot's hope all over the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>They paused, and with reverence and piety gazed back on all these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Yet with their own hands they had dragged them down to the earth, and with their feet trampled on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Yet they were not appalled, for their confidence was in the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Justice and in the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>They were ready to drop the curtain, and move onward in the path of duty and of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>They were no shouting mob &mdash; no festering fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>With them, Liberty was not a painted strumpet dragging herself through the streets. --They were a calm, grave deliberating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>religious people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>They were fighting for Liberty, fighting for their fathers' graves; and in this fight, for days and weeks, his little State stood alone &mdash; that little State, around whose border the guns fired at her capital might almost be heard &mdash; so small, so weak, so few, they began the fight alone against the <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and had <num value="1000000">millions</num> been piled upon <num value="1000000">millions</num> in this fight they would have triumphed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in whom they trust, cares for Liberty and for Justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>But they were now no longer alone, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, came to their side; and now, young <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> had raised her giant form, and marches to the right of the column, to frame this confederated sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>And whenever a Virginia spoke, his voice was listened to, because it was known he spoke in the tongue of his mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> of the humblest of her sons, but he told them that before the spring produced grass enough to weave <num value="1">one</num> chaplet of victory, there would be heard <num value="1">one</num> sound of mighty hosts of men, and be seen floating over them that banner whose whole list of conquests is glorious, without <num value="1">one</num> blot or stain; and the voice that from those hosts came up would be the same that thundered in the ears of your patriot sires-- &#x0022;Give me liberty, or give me death!&#x0022; [Great applause.] On that banner would be but <num value="1">one</num> word, and that the honored name of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>He believed he had not promised too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>He believed she would come and take her place in the front rank of Liberty and Justice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> He feared he was deluded by the scene and place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>to go beyond his intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Yet with the permission of the <rs>Convention</rs> he would steal a few more minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>He had endeavored to confine himself to subjects in connection with his own State, and would now proceed to give what the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> deemed the fundamental causes why there could never be a reconstruction of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, He then alluded to the principles of irreconcilable diversity between the <num value="2">two</num> fundamental systems of slaveholding and non-slaveholding communities, and showed that this revolution and separation was not a mere accident, nor a casual result of a temporary cause; not a more evanescent bubble of popular error or irritation &mdash; not an act of personal or individual ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>The <num value="2">two</num> sections of people could not dwell together, there was no community of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/><rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery cannot exist at the <rs>North</rs>; the <rs>South</rs> cannot exist without it. He then gave a forcible view of the basis of social and political organism at the <rs>North</rs>, and contrasted it with that of the <rs>South</rs>, sustaining his position throughout by masterly and un- <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> answerable argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>He then spoke of the profane sentiment that controlled the <rs type="place">Church</rs> at the <rs>North</rs>, which had arrayed itself in forms as bloody as any that had been exhibited since <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00503" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> came upon earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>There was not, he said, a Christian man &mdash; a slaveholder, in this assembly, but would admit that from the point of the sword of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> is at this moment dropping the last blood of sympathy that bound them together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/> Acting upon these views, his people believed that the political Union was unnatural and monstrous, and that from it could spring nothing but the brood of evils which always spring from unnatural alliances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It had, so soon, converted a popular Government into a Government of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>It was these irreconcilable diversities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>that enabled that Government to point cannon, charge with bomb-shells, at the people of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; and in less than <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, the same diversity would be re-enacted at <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName> and <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00504" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> as the scenes of <dateStruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>There was no human force &mdash; no sanctity of human touch.--that could re-unite the people of the <rs>North</rs> with the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>It could never be done, unless the economy of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> were changed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> The question for the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to decide was whether they would be contented, like the modern <rs>Egyptians</rs>, to skulk for protection under the fragments of fallen greatness, or step forth and keep forever bright the glory of their name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>He conceived it impossible for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to hesitate in deciding the question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/> He then quoted from the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> ordinance of secession, to show that the people declared they had never parted with their independence and sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>When all else had failed, justice required a resort to arms <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> believes her cause is just.--She had maintained it a reasonable time, and now a Confederation of sovereign States has come to her aid.

<head>Horror: a true tale.<lb/>[concluded.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/> Notwithstanding this silence, by some intuition I knew that I had not been deceived by a dream, and felt certain that I was not alone.-- I waited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>My heart beat on; quicker, more sudden grew its pulsations, as a bird in a cage might flutter in presence of the hawk.-- And then I heard a sound, faint, but quite distinct, the clank of iron, the rattling of a chain ! I ventured to lift my head from the pillow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Dim and uncertain as the light was I saw the curtains of my bed shake, and caught a glimpse of something beyond, a darker spot in he darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>This confirmation of my fears did not surprise me so much as it shocked me. I strived to cry aloud, but could not utter a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>The chain rattled again, and this time the noise was louder and clearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>But though I strained my eyes, they could not penetrate the obscurity that shrouded the other end of the chamber, whence came the sullen clanking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>In a moment several distinct trains of thought, like many colored strands of thread twining into <num value="1">one</num>, became palpable to my mental vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Was it a robber?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>could it be a supernatural visitant?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>or was I the victim of a cruel trick, such as I had heard of, and which some thoughtless persons love to practice on the timid, reckless of its dangerous results?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>And then a new idea, with some ray of comfort in it, suggested itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>There was a fine young dog of the <name>Newfoundland</name> breed, a favorite of my father's which was usually chained by night in an out- house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/><persName n="Neptune,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00576" reg="mostcommon:Neptune,nomatch:0"><surname>Neptune</surname></persName> might have broken loose, found his way to my room, and, finding the door imperfectly closed, have pushed it open and entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>I breathed more freely as this harmless interpretation of the noise forced itself upon me. It was &mdash; it must be &mdash; the dog, and I was distressing myself uselessly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>I resolved to call to him; I strove to utter his name--&#x0022;<persName n="Neptune,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00577" reg="mostcommon:Neptune,nomatch:0"><surname>Neptune</surname></persName>, <persName n="Neptune,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00578" reg="mostcommon:Neptune,nomatch:0"><surname>Neptune</surname></persName>!&#x0022; but a secret apprehension restrained me, and I was mute.--Then the chain clanked nearer and nearer to the bed, and presently I saw a dusky shapeless mass appear between the curtains on the opposite side to where I was lying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>How I longed to hear the whine of the poor animal that I hoped might be the cause of my alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>But no; I heard no sound save the rustle of the curtains and the clash of the iron chain. --Just then the dying flame of the fire leaped up, and with <num value="1">one</num> sweeping hurried glance I saw that the door was shut, and, horror ! it is not the dog ! it is the semblance of a human form that now throws itself heavily on the bed, outside the clothes, and lies there, huge and swart, in the red gleam that treacherously dies away after showing so much to affright, and sinks into dull darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>There was now no light left, though the red cinders yet glowed with a ruddy gleam, like the eyes of wild beasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>The chain rattled no more.--I tried to speak, to scream wildly for help; my mouth was parched, my tongue refused to obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>I could not utter a cry, and, indeed, who could have heard me, alone as I was in that solitary chamber, with no living neighbor, and the picture-gallery between me and any aid that even the loudest, most piercing shriek could summon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>And the storm that howled without would have drowned my voice, even if help had been at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>To call aloud &mdash; to demand who was there &mdash; alas ! how useless, how perilous!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>If the intruder were a robber, my outcries would but goad him to fury; but what robber would act thus?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>As for a trick, that seemed impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>And yet, what lay by my side, now wholly unseen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>I strove to pray aloud, as there rushed on my memory a flood of weird legends &mdash; the dreaded yet fascinating lore of my childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>I had heard and read of the spirits of wicked men forced to revisit the scenes of their earthly crimes &mdash; of demons that lurked in certain accursed spots &mdash; of the ghoul and vampire of the <rs>East</rs>, stealing amid the graves they rifled for their ghostly banquets; and I shuddered as I gazed on the blank darkness where I knew it lay. It stirred &mdash; it moaned hoarsely; and again I heard the chain clank close beside me &mdash; so close that it must almost have touched me. I drew myself from it, shrinking away in loathing and terror of the evil thing &mdash; what, I knew not, but felt that something malignant was near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>And yet, in the extremity of my fear, I dared not speak; I was strangely cautious to be silent, even in moving farther off; for I had a wild hope that it &mdash; the phantom, the creature, whatever it was &mdash; had not discovered my presence in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>And then I remembered all the events of the night --<persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00579" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName>'s ill- opened vaccinations, her half-warnings, her singular look as we parted, my sister's persuasions, my terror in the gallery, the remark that &#x0022;this was the room nurse <persName n="Sherrard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00580" reg="mostcommon:Sherrard,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherrard</surname></persName> used to talk of,&#x0022; And then memory, stimulated by fear, recalled the long forgotten past, the ill repute of this disused chamber, the sins it had witnessed, the blood spilled, the poison administered by unnatural bate within its walls, and the tradition which called it haunted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>The green room &mdash; I remembered now how fearfully the servants avoided it &mdash; how it was mentioned rarely, and in whispers, when we were children, and how we had regarded it as a mysterious region, unfit for mortal habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Was it &mdash; the dark form with the chain &mdash; a creature of this world, or a spectre?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>And again &mdash; more dreadful still &mdash; could it be that the corpses of wicked men were forced to rise, and haunt in the body the places where they had wrought their evil deeds?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>And was such as these my grisly neighbor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>The chain faintly rattled.--My hair bristled; my eye-balls seemed starting from their sockets; the damps of a great anguish were on my brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>My heart labored as if I were crushed beneath some vast weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Sometimes it appeared to stop its frenzied beatings, sometimes its pulsations were fierce and hurried; my breath came short and with extreme difficulty, and I shivered as if with cold; yet I feared to stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/><hi rend="italics">It</hi> moved, it moaned, its fetters clanked dismally, the couch creaked and shook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>This was no phantom, then &mdash; no air-drawn spectre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>But its very solidity, its palpable presence, were a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times more terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>I felt that I was in the very grasp of what could not only affright, but harm; of something whose contact sickened the soul with deathly fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>I made a desperate resolve: I glided from the bed, I seized a warm wrapper, threw it around me, and tried to grope, with extended hands, my way to the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>My heart beat high at the hope of escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>But I had scarcely taken <num value="1">one</num> step, before the moaning was renewed, it changed into a threatening growl that would have suited a wolf's throat, and a hand clutched at my sleeve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>I stood motionless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>The muttering growl sank to a moan again, the chain sounded no more, but still the hand held its gripe of my garment and I feared to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>It knew of my presence then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>My brain reeled, the blood boiled in my ears, and my knees lost all strength, while my heart panted like that of a deer, in the wolf's jaws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>I sank back, and the benumbing influence of excessive terror reduced me to a state of stupor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>When my full consciousness returned, I was sitting on the edge of the bed, shivering with cold, and barefooted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>All was silent, but I felt that my sleeve was still clutched by my unearthly visitant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>The silence lasted a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Then followed a chuckling laugh, that froze my very marrow, and the gnashing of teeth as in demoniac frenzy; and then a walling moan, and this was succeeded by silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Hours may have passed &mdash; nay, though the tumult of my own heart prevented my hearing the clock strike, must have passed &mdash; but they seemed ages to me. And how were they spent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>Hideous visions passed before the aching eyes that I dared not close, but which gazed ever into the dumb darkness where it lay &mdash; my dread companion through the watches of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>I pictured it in every abhorrent form which an excited fancy could summon up; now as a skeleton, with hollow eye-holes and grinning, fleshless jaws: now as a vampire, with livid face and bloated form, and dripping mouth wet with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Would it never be light ! And yet, when day should dawn, I should be forced to see it face to face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>I had heard that spectre and blend were compelled to fade as morning brightened, but this creature was too real, too foul a thing of earth, to vanish at cock-crow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>No! I should see it &mdash; the horror --face to face!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>And then the cold prevailed, and my teeth chattered, and shivering ran through me, and yet there was the damp of agony on my bursting brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Some instinct made me snatch at a shawl or cloak that lay on a chair within reach, and wrap it round me. The moan was renewed, and the chain just stirred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>Then I sank into apathy, like an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> at the stake, in the intervals of torture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>Hours fled by, and I remained like a statue of ice, rigid and mute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>I even slept, for I remember that I started to find the cold grey light of an early winter's day was on my face, and stealing around the room from between the heavy curtains of the window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Shuddering, but urged by the impulse that rivets the gaze of the bird upon the <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs>, I turned to see the <name>Horror</name> of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>Yes, it was no fevered dream, no hallucination of sickness, no airy phantom unable to face the dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>In the sickly light I saw it lying on the bed with its grim head on the pillow.-- A man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Or a corpse arisen from its unhallowed grave, and awaiting the demon that animated it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>There it lay &mdash; a gaunt gigantic form, wasted to a skeleton, half clad, foul with dust and clotted gore, its huge limbs flung upon the couch as if at random, its shaggy hair streaming over the pillows like a lion's mane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>Its free was towards me. Oh, the wild hideousness of that face, even in sleep ! In features it was human, even through its horrid mask of mud, and half-dried bloody gouts, but the expression was brutish and savagely fierce; the white teeth were visible between the parted lips, in a malignant grin; the tangled hair and beard were mixed in leonine confusion, and there were scars disfiguring the brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Round the creature's wrist was a ring of iron, to which was attached a heavy but broken chain &mdash; the chain I had heard clanking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>With a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> glance I noted that part of the chain was wrapped in straw, to prevent it galling the wearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>The creature &mdash; I can not call it a man &mdash; had the marks of betters on its wrists, the bony arm that protruded through <num value="1">one</num> tattered sleeve was scarred and bruised; the feet were bare, and lacerated by pebbles and briers, and <num value="1">one</num> of them was <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> wounded, and wrapped in a <unclear>al</unclear> of gag &mdash; And the lean hands, <num value="1">one</num> of which held my sleeve, were armed with tailors like an eagle's. In an instant the horrid truth flashed upon me &mdash; I was in the grasp of a madman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Better the phantom that scares the sight than the wild beast that rends and tears the quivering flesh &mdash; the pitiless human brute that has no heart to be softened, no reason at whose bar to plead, no compassion, nought of man save the form and the cunning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>I gasped in terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>Ah ! the mystery of those ensanguined fingers, those gory, wolfish jaws ! that face, all besmeared with blackening blood, is revealed ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/> The slain sheep, so mangled and rent &mdash; the fantastic butchery &mdash; the print of a naked foot --all, all were explained; and the chain, the broken link of which was found near the slaughtered animals &mdash; it came from <hi rend="italics">his</hi> broken chain &mdash; the chain he had snapped, doubtless, in his escape from the asylum where his raging frenzy had been fettered and bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>In vain ! in vain ! Ah, me ! how had this grisly <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00581" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName> broken manacles and prison bars --how had he eluded guardian and keeper and a hostile world, and come hither on his wild way hunted like a beast of prey, and snatching his hideous banquet like a beast of prey, too?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>Yes, through the tatters of his mean and ragged garb I could see the marks of the severities, cruel and foolish, with which men in that time tried to tame the might of mad-ness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>The scourge &mdash; its marks were there; and the scars of the hard iron fetters, and many a cicatrices and welt, that told a dismal tale of harsh usage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>But now he was loose, free to play the brute &mdash; the belted, tortured brute that they had made him &mdash; now without the cage, and ready to gloat over the victims his strength should overpower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Horror ! horror ! I was the prey &mdash; the victim &mdash; already in the tiger's clutch; and a deadly sickness came over me, and the iron entered into my soul, and I longed to scream, and was numb ! I died a <num value="1000">thousand</num> deaths as that awful morning wore on. <hi rend="italics">I dared not</hi> faint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>ut words cannot paint what I suffered as I waited &mdash; waited till the moment when he should open his eyes and be aware of my presence; for I was assured he knew it not. He had entered the chamber as a lair, when weary and gorged with his horrid orgie; and he had flung himself down to sleep without a suspicion that he was not alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>Even his grasping my sleeve was doubtless an act done betwixt sleeping and waking, like his unconscious moans and laughter, in some frightful dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Hours went on; then I trembled as I thought that soon the house would be astir, that my maid would come to call me as usual, and awake that ghastly sleeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>And might he not have time to tear me, as he tore the sheep, before any aid could arrive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>At last what I dreaded came to pass &mdash; a light footstep on the landing-- there is a tap at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>A pause succeeds, and then the tapping is renewed, and this time more loudly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Then the madman stretches his limbs and uttered his moaning cry, and his eyes slowly opened &mdash; very slowly opened, and met mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>The girl waited a while ere she knocked for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>I trembled lest she should open the door unbidden &mdash; see that grim thing, and by her idle screams and terror bring about the worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Long before strong men could arrive I knew that I should be dead &mdash; and what a death ! The maid waited, no doubt surprised at my unusually sound slumbers, for I was in general a light sleeper and an early riser, but reluctant to deviate from habit by entering without permission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>I was still alone with the thing in man's shape, but he was awake now. I saw the wondering surprise in his haggard bloodshot eyes; I saw him stare at me half vacantly, then with a crafty yet wondering look; and then I saw the devil of murder begin to peep forth from those hideous eyes, and the lips to part as in a sneer, and the wolfish teeth to bare themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>But I was not what I had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Fear gave me a new and a desperate composure &mdash; a courage foreign to my nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>I had heard of the best method of managing the insane; I could but try; I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> try. Calmly, wondering at my own feigned calm, I confronted the glare of his terrible eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>Steady and undaunted was my gaze &mdash; motionless my attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>I marvelled at myself, but in that agony of sickening terror I was <hi rend="italics">outwardly</hi> firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>They sink, they quail abashed, those dreadful eyes, before the gaze of a helpless girl; and the shame that is never absent from insanity bears down the pride of strength, the bloody cravings of the wild beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The lunatic moaned and drooped his shaggy head between his gaunt, squalid hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>I lost not an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>I rose, and with <num value="1">one</num> spring reached the door, tore it open, and, with a shriek rushed through, caught the wondering girl by the arm, and, crying to her to run for life, rushed like the wind along the gallery, down the corridor, down the stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/><persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>'s screams filled the house as she fled beside me. I heard a long-drawn, raging cry, the roar of a wild animal mocked of its prey, and I knew what was behind me. I never turned my head &mdash; I flew rather than ran. I was in the hall already; there was a rush of many feet, an out- cry of many voices, a sound of scuffling feet, and brutal yells, and oaths, and heavy blows, and I fell to the ground, crying &#x0022;Save me !&#x0022; and lay in a swoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>I awoke from a delirious trance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>Kind faces were around my bed, loving looks were bent on me by all, by my dear father and dear sisters, but I scarcely saw them before I swooned again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/> When I recovered from that long illness, through which I had been nursed so tenderly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>the pitying looks I met made me tremble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>I asked for a <rs n="looking glass" type="product">looking-glass</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>It was long denied me, but my importunity prevailed at last &mdash; a mirror was brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>My youth was gone at <num value="1">one</num> fell swoop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>The glass showed me a livid and haggard face, blanched and bloodless as of <num value="1">one</num> who sees a spectre; and in the ashen lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>and wrinkled brow, and dim eyes, I could trace nothing of my old self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>The hair, too, jetty and rich before, was now as white as snow, and in <num value="1">one</num> night the ravages of half a century had passed over my face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>Nor have my nerves ever recovered their tone after that dire shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>Can you wonder that my life was blighted, that my lover shrank from me, so sad a wreck was I?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>I am old now &mdash; old and alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>My sisters would have me to live with them, but I choose not to sadden their genial homes with my phantom face and dead eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/><persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName> married another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>He has been dead many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>I never ceased to pray for him, though he left me when I was bereft of all. The sad weird is nearly over now. I am old, and near the end, and wishful for it. I have not been bitter or hard, but I cannot bear to see many people, and am best alone. -- I try to do what good I can with the worth less wealth <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00582" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName> left me, for at my wish my portion was shared between my sisters.
