<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> --The <orgName n="Richmond Examiner" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi></orgName> says the late sickness in the camps <q>&#x0022;is an everlasting reproach to the medical authorities of the army,&#x0022;</q> whose attention should have been turned to the causes of this mischief and the proper preventive applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><q>&#x0022;Their powers,&#x0022;</q> says the <hi rend="italics">Examiner,</hi> <q>&#x0022;are of the amplest character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We happen to know that they have had every aid from the <rs>Generals</rs> and associated officers in command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In any instances which they have failed because the requisite help was not extended to them by other departments of the army, they should have appealed to the proper authorities here, and if this appeal (contrary to our firm belief) had proved ineffectual, they should have thrown up their commissions rather than appear as the heartless and indifferent spectators of the sufferings of our troops.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi> proceeds: </p> <cit> <q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> &#x0022;All the accounts which have come to us have made a most unfavorable impression as to the care of the sick by the surgeons.--We were told the other day, by a gentleman of undoubted credibility, of an instance where some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500" type="sick">five hundred sick</measure> men reached <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> late in the day on their way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The rain was pouring down when these men got to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, but no provision whatever had been made for their reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They were forced out of the cars and left to seek shelter from the rain for themselves as they best could.--Some few of them managed to get into the hospitals; the others were forced to lie down in the rain, helpless and suffering, with no covering but the leaves of the trees and their blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What possible excuse can there be for such wretched mismanagement as this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>What brutality of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to our prisoners can exceed this infamous wrong and outrage upon the men who are willing to lay down their lives for their country? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> &#x0022;The soldiers thus brutally treated were allowed to pursue their journey in the cars to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, without food of any kind, and were dependent on the charity of private individuals for relief from the cravings of hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><num value="1">One</num> of these, we are advised, spent a <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars</measure> to relieve them from his own pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>On reaching this city a similar neglect prevailed, and men, with frames so weak that they could hardly stand up, were allowed to wander helplessly on the streets without direction or guidance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This is but <num value="1">one</num> of the many proofs we have had of a spirit of indolence, recklessness, and mismanagement in the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The subject hardly admits of comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We are persuaded that the able and energetic man at the head of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> will find, on giving his attention to the subject, that abuses exist which call loudly for reform.--We do not believe that he will permit such things to continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The whole subject of the care of the sick of the army must be reorganized, and those of the present medical staff who are unfit for their duties must be turned adrift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Doubtless many will be found to whom no exception can be taken, and for these our remarks above have no application.&#x0022; </p> </q> <bibl n="The Examiner"/> </cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> We transfer these serious charges to our columns for the purpose of increasing the chances of arresting the attention of the <rs>Government</rs>, and drawing it at once to an investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We have now a letter before us, handed to us by a highly respectable person, containing allegations of conduct at <num value="1">one</num> of our hospitals that would better become the realms of <hi rend="smallcaps">Lincolnism</hi> than <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We insist, in the name of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, who have given the idols of their hearts to this war, that this thing shall be probed to the, bottom, and these charges, which are flying about as thick as autumn leaves, shall be proved or disproved, so that the wrong may be redressed, the guilty punished, and faithful and competent officers no longer forced to share the odium which belongs alone to the inefficient, intemperate, and brutal. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which he quotes is as follows:--<q>&#x0022;No person holding any office under the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, shall be a member of either <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> during his continuance in office.&#x0022;</q> This is certainly as explicit as it well can be. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Randolph,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName></hi> observes that, although commissioned by the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, yet he is in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and therefore within the spirit, if not the letter, of the above prohibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The delicate sense of honor, and the sound judgment which dictated this conclusion, are what we might expect from <num value="1">one</num> who is as true a soldier as <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has in her camps, and as able a statesman as adorns her councils. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> This decision of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Randolph,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>,</hi> an eminent jurist, against his own eligibility to Congress, will probably suggest to other military officers who have been named in connexion with that position, and who, like <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Randolph,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName>,</hi> have had no opportunity heretofore of examining the permanent Constitution, to withdraw their names from the canvass, or resign their commissions in the army. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The huntsmen, too, have all gone off to fire at the enemy, who seem to be as hard to bring down on the wing as the birds, if we may judge from the <rs type="place">Bull Run</rs> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If there should be another fight in that direction shortly, by-the-by, we hope <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Peter,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName></hi> will have a pack of greyhounds ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>So it is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>They were a mother and a daughter.--The mother, the widow of a near relative of <persName><foreName>Joseph</foreName></persName> the prophet, had been married a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time to a priest whom we had once met with on a distant mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>She was an English woman, and, independently of an education little usual in the class to which she belonged, she was endowed with all those qualities which make her country women so respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Her daughter, <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, the only child of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> marriage, was a young person from <num value="16">sixteen</num> to <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age, as intelligent as she was pretty; it was impossible to grow tired of observing in her face that graceful blending of beauty and innocence which inspires in every man of feeling a respectful admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> In the spring previous the missionary returned home, after having been preaching to the savages for the space of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. He was received with open arms, as he had every right to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>However, it did not appear to him that the sacrifice of his long absence was sufficiently compensated by the affection of a woman who could not bear him children, and he requested and obtained from the presidency a revelation authorizing him to marry a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>So far no <num value="1">one</num> had reason to complain, since all this was in conformity with the manners of the place and according to law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The poor child refused, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> very timidly and gently, in hope that her step-father would not insist upon it. But he tormented his wife to use her authority over the child, to make her consent to this marriage; but as her mother-heart utterly rejected this office, she did nothing, and the consequence was dissensions in the family.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> Neither menaces, nor caresses, nor counsel, had any effect upon the girl, whose noble instincts revolted at the idea of her becoming her mother's rival, and who, moreover, was passionately in love with a man who had solemnly promised to marry her, and her alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The missionary found at last that there was no making head against so determined a will, and, out of spite, went and selected a woman from amongst the waiting women attached to the harem of <persName n="Kimball,,H.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="default:Kimball,H.,C.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Kimball</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>But a new storm was on the point of bursting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> wife was no sooner installed in the conjugal dwelling than she found out that she was only a make-shift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Calling to her aid every <unclear>article which</unclear> hatred could suggest, she succeeded in captivating her husband's heart; and the latter had so far forgotten himself as, on the very morning of the day on which we met these weeping women, to male treat them so grossly as to compel them to abandon the roof they had assisted in building and ornamenting with the fruit of their industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> Last week he was out hunting in a large bottom in the neighborhood, and he observed a wild goose fly out of a large cypress stump, which was some <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>His knowledge of the habits of these geese led him to believe that the goose had a nest in the stump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>On the outside of the stump were a number of vines, which he pulled up to peep in and get possession of the eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>After he had succeeded in gaining the top of the stump, he discovered a large number of eggs some <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> down inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The nest, he supposed, was on a firm foundation, and he accordingly let himself down inside; but when he struck the substance on which the nest was built, he discovered that the nest had no foundation, and soon found himself sinking to the bottom of the tree. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> The inside of the tree was rotten, and would not bear his weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Now, he was in a dilemma; <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> from any habitation, inside of a stump <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> high, with no prospect of assistance, with nothing to subsist on but the goose eggs, he screamed and yelled until he was nearly exhausted, no <num value="1">one</num> coming within hearing distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>They were very much frightened at hearing a man groaning inside of the stump, and for some time they could not reconcile themselves to what it meant; but, having learned that the gentleman had been missing from home for several days, they were soon satisfied that it was no ghost inside the tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>They procured axes, and soon the prisoner was liberated.
