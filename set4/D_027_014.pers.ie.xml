<head>The War news.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The city was excited yesterday by a rumor of vast proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It was said to have emanated from official sources, and was in effect as follows: The people of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> had &#x0022;risen&#x0022; upon the <rs>Federal</rs> forces in that city, overcome them, and invited the <rs>Confederates</rs> to enter and take possession; which they accordingly did. Upon application at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, we could get no confirmation of this report; if <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> was in our possession, the authorities here knew nothing of it. Thus the rumor had no foundation in fact, though as it progressed it gathered proportions, and by nightfall had spread through every portion of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It was stated that it had its origin in this way: That a gentleman connected with the press was informed by a member of Congress that a Staff officer had told him that the <rs>Government</rs> authorities had a Washington paper of the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num>, which furnished the important news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is almost needless to add that the news in the paper of the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num>, (given in another column,) contains no such intelligence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Last evening it was reported that a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deserter, who yesterday came into our lines at <placeName reg="Chester, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,1122736">Chester</placeName>, stated that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> was in the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>If it be true that such a statement was made, it is entitled to no credit, for deserters are not usually to be relied upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The latest news we have is from the <rs>Washington</rs> <hi rend="italics">Chronicle</hi> of the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th inst.</day></dateStruct>, which will be found in this morning's paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We learn, in addition, that <persName n="Wallace,General,Lew,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Wallace,Lew,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Lew</foreName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName>, who was defeated by the <rs>Confederates</rs> at <placeName reg="Monocracy Bridge">Monocracy Bridge</placeName> and fled from the field in confusion, has been relieved of his command and superseded by <persName n="Ord,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Ord,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ord</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> A gentleman from the <rs>Northern Neck</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> reports that <placeName key="tgn,2036393" n="1.000 4" reg="fulton, bourbon, kansas">Forts Lincoln</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Stephens">Stephens</placeName>, which constitute a portion of the defences of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, were carried by the <rs>Confederates</rs> on the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="2">13th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We are not prepared to vouch for the accuracy of this statement, though we see no reason for doubting it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We have it from the best authority that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has moved <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> and a large quantity of artillery from the front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and sent them to aid in the defence of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> A gentleman who arrived in <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> from <placeName reg="Fairfax, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7014160">Fairfax county</placeName>, which place he left on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last, states that the excitement in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was intense, and that the <name>Lincolnites</name> were in great fear and trepidation consequent upon the advance of the <rs>Confederates</rs> into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were removing all stores from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and all public archives and property of every description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Confusion worse confounded prevailed in the <rs>Federal</rs> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This gentleman derived his information from parties last from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and it may be relied upon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> <rs type="role2">Private</rs> advices from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> affirm that by order of the <rs>General</rs> commanding, private property was strictly respected by our army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This disagrees totally with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts, and we hope, so far as it applies to the miscegenations, that it is untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They should be made to feel some of the evils of the war which they are so relentlessly waging upon the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The Confederates in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--<persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName> gone to <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> We had a conversation with an intelligent gentleman from our army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, who arrived here last night, having been within <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName></placeName> with the <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> Monday at <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time>. He gives some interesting particulars about the &#x0022;raiders&#x0022; in that State, some of which we can make public. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The cavalry on Monday was in <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName></placeName>, and met on the roads leading from the city many citizens who had come out from the place, not desiring to be there when it was &#x0022;carried by assault,&#x0022; as they supposed it would be. Several of them claimed to be good &#x0022;secesh,&#x0022; and said they hoped our troops would go in, that now was the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The soldiers there, they said, were nearly all heavy artillerymen, and most of them new <measure n="100days" type="date">100 days</measure> men from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>All the old soldiers and fighting troops had been sent a week before to <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName>, and are now with him on top of <placeName reg="Maryland Heights, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2495447">Maryland Heights</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They were sent under the impression that the <rs>Confederate</rs> raiders were a small force and would not think of going around the rear of the <rs type="place">Heights</rs> and leaving <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName> in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>With <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName> they are now cut off from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>These citizens said there were not <num value="2">two</num> full regiments of real soldiers in <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>There were a good many long faces among the <rs>Union</rs> people living along the roads in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and they got a good deal longer Monday when a farm house about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles distant</measure> from the city was burnt by the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Our informant did not know the name of the owner of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>A gentleman living near the city handed over about <num value="100">100</num> fat cattle to our cavalry, to be driven into Dixie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He refused to take pay for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> At <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, our cavalry was hovering around the town in sight of its fortifications, which are about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles distant</measure> from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are all inside of the works and have no pickets out, our cavalry having run into town the few they did have out. <placeName><persName n="Bradford,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Bradford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Bradford</surname></persName>'s house</placeName> which was burned, was within a stone's throw of <num value="1">one</num> of the works &mdash; so close that a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hallooed out &#x0022;never mind, d &mdash; n you, we'll pay you for that.&#x0022; To this a ragged rebel replied, begging him not to mind that little bill, that the <rs>Confederates</rs> intended to burn <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> next day, and he could settle it all at once. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Citizens who came out of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> said the place could easily be taken by the cavalry then around it, as the soldiers of the garrison were out aiding <persName n="Wallace,General,Lew,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Wallace,Lew,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Lew</foreName> <surname>Wallace</surname></persName> in a search for a large body of rebel infantry, which were reported to be near <placeName reg="Monocracy Bridge">Monocracy Bridge</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The fight at <placeName reg="Monocracy bridge">Monocracy bridge</placeName>, our informant says, was just no fight at all. It was a big run, and if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> lost <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men, most of them must have broken their necks running.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There wasn't a soldier with <persName n="Wallace,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Wallace,Lew,,,"><surname>Wallace</surname></persName> who fired more than once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They found the rebels getting around them in all directions, and, using discretion, took to their heels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure> men are described as &#x0022;splendid.&#x0022; They all had on nice new blue uniforms, shiny brass </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> buttons, and muskets as bright as if they had just come out of the store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They also had brand-new shoes, many pairs of which some of the rebels in delicate health, who had gotten their feet wet, were forced to borrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>These warriors didn't seem disposed to hurt anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Some of them didn't know which end of a cartridge went in <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and the general impression among them was that the regulation mode of getting the ramrod out of a gun was to blow it out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> Some <placeName key="tgn,7007710" n="1.000 4175" reg="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</placeName> men who were in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and had not been able to make their escape back home, were quite talkative to our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They themselves were <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, (of course,) and didn't favor the war, and didn't intend to come out at anybody's requisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They disclosed, however, a state of feeling on the part of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> which is rather interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They say that their <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> neighbors won't come out to defend their homes, though <persName n="Curtin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Curtin,nomatch:0"><surname>Curtin</surname></persName>'s call had been out a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>These miscegenations say they cannot join the patriots for a <measure n="100days" type="date">hundred days</measure> any more than a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, as <num value="1">one</num> day among the rebels might damage them beyond the chance of repair at any price.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress, before it adjourned, passed a resolution requiring <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to appoint a day of humiliation and prayer for the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and that inactions has, by proclamation, recommended the <date value="08-01">first Thursday of August</date> as the day. In that proclamation, it seems, he advised them to &#x0022;confess and repeat of their manifold stus, to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the <name>Almighty</name>, and to pray that, if consistent with His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily suppressed, and the supremacy of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and Laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> be established throughout the <name>States</name>; that the rebels may lay down their arms and speedily return to their allegiance; that they may not be utterly destroyed; that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that amity and fraternity may be restored and peace established throughout our border,&#x0022; &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> The Congressional resolution and the <name>Presidential</name> proclamation are remarkable on more accounts than <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>In the first place, it forms the solitary instance of humiliation and prayer recommended by the authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> during this war. There have been numerous &#x0022;<unclear></unclear>&#x0022;ordered &mdash; numerous commands from the throne to thank the <name>Almighty</name> for blessings bestowed, and to pray for a continuance of Divine favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Very slight occasions have been sufficient to call them forth &mdash; The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, for example, were ordered to rejoice with all their hearts for their so-called &#x0022;victory&#x0022; of <placeName reg="Pitts's Landing">Pitts's Landing</placeName>, in which they were nearly annihilated, under the impious belief that it was as easy to cheat the <name>Almighty</name> as it was to cheat <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, for whose particular benefit the farce was contrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>But this is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, speaking through its representatives in both Houses of Congress and its Executive, has ever acknowledged that it had anything to repent of, anything to be ashamed of, anything for which it could do aught else than lift up its hands to heaven and shout for joy.--Truly, the situation in which it finds itself must be a hard and painful <num value="1">one</num>--a very different <num value="1">one</num> from what we should conclude it to be, did we rely on the reports of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> for our information with regard to it. If those veracious chroniclers and their echoes of the press are to be relied on, this should be a time of thanksgiving, not of humiliation and prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>If, however, the proclamation is to be carried out in the spirit as well as the letter, we doubt whether any nation ever had more cause to implore the mercy of Heaven.--That mercy, we are well aware, is infinite, and it is fortunate for Yankeedom that it is so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> In another respect, this appeal to the <name>Throne</name> of Grace is more remarkable still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Taking into consideration all the attending circumstances, we doubt if it be not the most remarkable of which we have any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>A despot, who has utterly subverted the <rs>Constitution</rs> of his own country, and extinguished the last spark of its liberties, appears before the altar and lifts up his hands, streaming with the blood of <num value="1000000">one million</num> of human beings, to that Omnipotent Being of whom not even the devils damned before the foundation of the world can think in the most secret recesses of their hearts without fear and trembling, and humbles himself, not because he repents of the crimes which he has authorized, but because they have failed to produce the result which he anticipated!. And he prays that in future the murders and desolation of which he is the author may bear their proper fruit, in the subjection of those whom they are designed to destroy, to his own will and pleasure!--Can anything more shockingly blasphemous he imagined? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> In the name of that blessed Redeemer who inculcated peace upon earth and good will to man, the <name>Almighty</name> is to be besought to allow &#x0022;this rebellion&#x0022; to be speedily suppressed, and as that cannot be done without exterminating the inhabitants, the <name>Almighty</name> is, of course, besought to aid in that work of blood and murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>At the same time he prays that the supremacy of the laws and <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> be restored &mdash; a Constitution which he himself has utterly destroyed, and laws to which, from the beginning of his most arbitrary and most oppressive reign, he has never paid the smallest respect, when they interfered in the slightest degree with his own despotic will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>He prays that the rebels may lay down their arms without giving him further trouble, it being his benevolent wish, no doubt, to have his choice among whom he shall hang, whom he shall imprison for life, whom he shall despoil, whom he shall turn over to be the slave of his own negroes, and whom he shall banish forever from the land of his birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>He prays that they may not be utterly destroyed, and that the effusion of blood may be stayed; that is that the shells he is firing every day upon unarmed cities may not kill all the women and babies, but only a portion thereof; that the shells may be endowed with discretion, and learn when they are fired what they are expected to do, and what to leave undone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In a word, having deceived everybody else, as he thinks, in this most blasphemous proclamation he attempts to deceive Omnipotence himself, and to make his Creator believe what he knows to be a palpable lie. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/> Such is the proclamation of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It is full of encouragement to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, for it reveals the fact that its enemies are in desperate straits, and see nothing to hope for in the arm of flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It is highly characteristic of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, which carries its love of trickery even to its devotions, and attempts to cheat Omnipotence himself. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>There seems no </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>All accounts agree that Sommes did not give himself up; that he did not even go down with his ship, as was proper and becoming, but, on the contrary, furtively, feloniously and with malice aforethought, escaped, swam off, and made away from the sinking vessel, stealing his life from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to whom it justly belonged, to the great loss, detriment and damage of the said <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, amounting the sum of &mdash; pounds, shillings and pence, hereafter to be more definitely ascertained. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We shall not stop to discuss such puerile pretexts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We expect from Confederate officers a soul above quibbles, and a cheerful sacrifice of themselves and their country rather than lay themselves open to an imputation of dishonor from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Moreover, this is not a mere question of logic, but <num value="1">one</num> of sentiment and feeling.
