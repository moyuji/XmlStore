<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The same state of quiet reported for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> past continues on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We have the assurance of persons who came over by last evening's train that only <num value="3">three</num> shells were thrown at the city during <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This, with some picket firing, constitutes the total of recent active hostilities in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It seems now to be well ascertained that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is busily mining on our left, and has been engaged in this underground work for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>What he expects to accomplish by operations of this sort is more than we can explain, though as he is a great believer in the spade as an instrument of warfare, it is quite possible that he designs the reduction of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and the destruction of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> by that method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>His disappointment will be signal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is also ascertained that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is strengthening his extreme left, resting upon the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This is his weak point, he having been twice flanked in that direction, with considerable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is stated by deserters that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been on the lookout for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> nights past, expecting an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>What gave rise to this idea does not seem to be known; but it is quite certain that nothing of the sort occurred, with the exception of the heavy cannonade on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. The report that the enemy had crossed a heavy force to the north side of the <rs>James</rs> has dwindled, down to a statement that he sent over a portion of <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, near <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, which is doubtless correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This agrees with intelligence we had previously learned and published in this paper.--The object of this movement is probably to prevent our artillery firing upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> transports. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The lady, with tears in her eyes, made complaint to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>, the men were arrested, tried, and condemned to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The correspondent adds that the chain of evidence was mostly circumstantial, and that an officer who was on the court-martial afterwards said that the breaking of <num value="1">one</num> link of that evidence would have freed the guilty wretches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> instance only in which the brutal <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiery have expiated their heinous offences with their lives. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The only foundation for this report was that a skirmish took place in that locality, in which <num value="49">forty-nine</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who were on picket, were taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Our informant states that not more than <num value="14">fourteen</num> rounds were fired, and so slight was the engagement that companies stationed <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> off knew nothing of it until the prisoners were brought in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> On Saturday the enemy took possession of some pits which had been used by our artillery firing upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> transports, and proceeded to construct fortifications in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It was for this purpose, undoubtedly, that the <rs>Federal</rs> troops were sent across the river. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The telegram from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> shows that the enemy has again been repulsed in an attempt to break our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In every respect do the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> violate the usages of civilized warfare, and for each non- combatant killed, at least <measure n="4" type="prisoners">four prisoners</measure> ought to suffer death. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The inconsistency of such a war with the principles and essence of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government &mdash; liberty and national sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Such charming simplicity in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> makes even us barbarians laugh.
