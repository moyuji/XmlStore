<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>They are already caught, and consequently the decree which consigns them to bondage is immediate, absolute, and unconditional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>All the opposition press still treat it as having a tendency to prolong rather than shorten the unhappy struggle in which our country is engaged; and even the journals which have heretofore been most friendly to us are expressing dissatisfaction with it, considering it &#x0022;neither fish, flesh, nor fowl.&#x0022; The <hi rend="italics">Presse</hi> in particular, finds fault with it, because, as <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> states in his circular to our ministers and consuls abroad, it is &#x0022;a military act,&#x0022; and adds. &#x0022;This is very unsatisfactory for those who desired to see in it a moral act.
