<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> At about <time value="1:30oclock">half-past 1 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> morning the prevailing quiet was rudely broken by a sudden and very rapid cannonade in the direction of the harbor entrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The brief intervals between the reports of the heavy guns were filled by the roll of musketry, and all who heard the firing in the city thought that warm work had begun at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It appears, from the accounts that we have received, that at <time value="1:30">half-past 1</time> A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>They were steered towards various portions of the ledge of rocks outside the fort, (known, technically, we believe, as the berm,) but most of them directed their course, towards the gorge face, which, being now a sloping mass of bricks and rubbish, seemed to afford the most inviting opportunity for the assault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> As soon as the barges were seen by our vigilant sentries on the parapet <num value="3">three</num> rockets were thrown up to notify their comrades at the other batteries of the danger at hand.--With commendable alacrity the guns of <orgName n="Fort Johnson battery" type="battery">Fort Johnson, battery</orgName> <persName n="Simkins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Simkins,nomatch:0"><surname>Simkins</surname></persName>, <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, and the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Chicora</rs>, opened upon the barges, and simultaneously the infantry, judiciously posted within the fort, poured into the crowded boats of the assailants a rapid and spirited fire of musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The foremost boats of the enemy, however, soon gained the ledge, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> sprang to the assault with vigor and determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It is scarcely necessary to add that these last, foiled in their effort to surprise the garrison, and not daring to take to their boats, surrendered at discretion, and announced the fact in tones which could be heard high above the splashing of the waves and the din of the engagement. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> Let us take an illustration which any clod-hopper can understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/><num value="4">Four</num> big, burly fellows make an assault upon a small man, and after a long fight, in which the plucky little fellow knocks <num value="1">one</num> or the other of the ruffians down a dozen times, they succeed in flooring him once or twice, and thereupon they set up such a shout of triumph as makes the welkin ring, and appoint a day of thanks-giving and prayer for their wonderful success!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, what in your inmost soul &mdash; or in the place where a soul ought to be &mdash; would you think of those <num value="4">four</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Would not their very exultation be a glorying in their shame?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Would not their yells of triumph be actually a tribute to the courage of their enemy, and confession of their own inferiority? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/> We have never believed that slavery had as much to do with this war as personal resentment and vindictiveness, transmitted from generation to generation, smouldering embers of the old Cavalier and <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> feuds, which had never died out. The descendants of those <num value="2">two</num> classes in the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> would have gone to war, sooner or later, if such a thing as slavery had never existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>We do not include all the <rs>North</rs> in the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs>, any more than all the <rs>South</rs> in the <name>Cavalier</name> classification, but that is the predominant element in each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Slavery is but the occasion of the strife, and its real provocations are the envy, malice, hatred, and all uncharitableness, which have characterized the deportment of <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> towards its political and ecclesiastical superiors from the beginning of its existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/> Perhaps, of all the barbed weapons cast on both sides before this war, none has rankled so deeply in <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> hearts as the imputation of cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>It mattered not that the imputation was not generally cast upon the <rs>North</rs> by Southern men, and that there were many of us who emphatically vindicated their character from the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>But they never forgave it, and we verily believe that <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only, if <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> at all, to the intense fanaticism of abolitionism, was the burning desire of the <rs>Northern</rs> people to clear their escutcheon of the blot of cowardice and achieve renown for chivalry and progress in arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/> Now, we ask them in all soberness if they think they have succeeded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>We, for <num value="1">one</num>, never doubted their courage up to the period of this war. We always entertained as profound a conviction that <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> and his followers were bold men as that they were bad men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>this uprising of the giant against the dwarf!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>this huge <persName n="Titan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00302" reg="mostcommon:Titan,nomatch:0"><surname>Titan</surname></persName>, hurling rocks not against the gods, but against a defenceless dweller in the plains, and calling upon all the powers of earth and hell to aid him in the contest &mdash; call you this chivalry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>or, even if he should succeed, glory? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> What have they done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>They began by vociferating in the halls of Congress that <num value="18000000">eighteen millions</num> of people could easily crush <num value="8">eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Is that their conception of chivalry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>They were not satisfied with the vast numerical preponderance, but they scoured the earth for reinforcements, filling their armies with <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> and <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> to establish <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> courage!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>They have called into the field, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, more than a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men. They had at the start all the regular army; all the old navy; all the machinery and mechanism of war; all the shipping of the country; all the workshops, manufactories, and commerce, besides access for men and munitions of war to all the nations of the earth, whilst we, with none of these advantages, have been shut out from all nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Surely, with such odds in their favor, whatever else their success in this war might prove, it would never vindicate that which they are most eager to establish--<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pluck and prowess. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/> What have these people to brag of?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>They never gained a victory which was not gained by the most enormous superiority in numbers and appliances of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Is it such achievements as these that make the <name>Wellington</name> or Napoleons of the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>What nation has ever yet established a name for heroism; what old warrior ever frowned in the brass or marble of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>; what trophied monument or tower ever rose to the memory of a chief, who gained his victories by the aid of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>It is not the countless host of <rs n="Persian" type="ethnic">Persians</rs>, but the <num value="300">three hundred</num> at Thermopyl&#x00E6; to whom every human heart raises a temple, and whose deeds flame over successive generations like the blaze of a light-house over the waves of the sea, rescuing from darkness even the hostile billows which sought its destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> No! The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may take every seaport town of the <rs>South</rs>; they may drive us to our mountain fastnesses; they may exterminate the last hero in the land, but they can never take from us, nor achieve for themselves, that which they so pant after &mdash; renown for courage and chivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>By huge machinery of muscle, bone and iron, by incalculable preponderance of numbers, by <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and, at last, by negroes, whom it avows to be a &#x0022;military necessity,&#x0022; the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation may achieve still further successes over a small and struggling people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>But this <num value="1">one</num> thing can it never do &mdash; achieve renown for heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>No renown except such as the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> <hi rend="italics">and <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York Tribune</orgName></hi> can confer, </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> will it ever obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The nation that can clap its hands, and spread its wings, and crow like chanticleer over an occasional victory, gained by <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, entitles itself to the supreme contempt of all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Not the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Eagle should henceforth decorate its banner, but a huge Turkey Cock, vain-glorious of &#x0022;gobbling&#x0022; every smaller creature, and &#x0022;skedaddling&#x0022; in hot haste from every adversary of equal size and power. </p> </div3>
