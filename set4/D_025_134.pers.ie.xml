<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The resolute spirit of the people soon rose superior to the temporary despondency naturally resulting from these reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The gallant troops, so ably commanded in the <name>States</name> beyond the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, indicted repeated defeats on the invading armies in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and on the coast of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.--Detachments of troops and active bodies of partisans kept up so effective a war on the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName> as practically to destroy its value as an avenue of commerce. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Unfortunately the communications on which our General relied for receiving his supplies of munitions were interrupted by extraordinary floods, which so swelled the <rs>Potomac</rs> as to render impassable the fords by which his advance had been made, and he was thus forced to a withdrawal, which was conducted with deliberation, after securing large trains of captured supplies, and a constant but unaccepted tender of battle.--On more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion the enemy has since made demonstrations of a purpose to advance, invariably followed by a precipitate retreat to entrenched lines on the approach of our forces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> The effective check thus offered to the advance of the invaders at all points, was such as to afford hope of their early expulsion from portions of the territory previously occupied by them, when the country was painfully surprised by the intelligence that the officer in command of <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName> had surrendered that important and easily defensible pass without firing a shot, upon the summons of a force still believed to have been inadequate to its reduction, and when reinforcements were within supporting distance and had been ordered to his aid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The combined forces thus accumulated against us in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> so greatly outnumbered our army as to encourage the enemy to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>After a long and severe battle, in which great carnage was inflicted on him, some of our troops inexplicably abandoned positions of great strength, and by a disorderly retreat compelled the commander to withdraw the forces elsewhere successfully, and finally to retire with his whole army to a position some <num value="20">twenty</num> or <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>it is believed that if the troops who yielded to the assault had fought with the valor which they had displayed on previous occasions, and which was manifested in this battle on the other parts of the line, the enemy would have been repulsed with very great slaughter, and our country would have escaped the misfortune, and the army the mortification, of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> defeat that has resulted from misconduct by the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In the meantime the <orgName>army of <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen'l</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName></orgName> was driven from all its field positions in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, and forced to retreat into its entrenchments at <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, where, for some weeks, it was threatened with capture by the forces under <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> While, therefore, our success in driving the enemy from our soil has not equalled the expectations confidently entertained at the commencement of the campaign, his further progress has been checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> You have heretofore been informed that, by common understanding, the initiative in all action touching the contest on this continent had been left by foreign powers to the <num value="2">two</num> great maritime nations of <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Western Europe</placeName>, and that the <name>Governments</name> of these <num value="2">two</num> nations had agreed to take no measures without previous concert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>This conclusion was justified by the fact that the <name>Governments</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> determined that it was necessary for their interests to obtain from both belligerents &#x0022;securities concerning the proper treatment of neutrals.&#x0022; In the instructions which &#x0022;confided the negotiation on this matter&#x0022; to the <rs>British Consul</rs> in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, he was informed that &#x0022;the most perfect accord on this question existed between <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government and the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>,&#x0022; and these instructions were accompanied by a copy of the dispatch of the <rs>British</rs> <orgName n="Foreign Office" type="office">Foreign office</orgName>, of the <date value="1861-05-18">18th May, 1861,</date> stating that there was no difference of opinion between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as to the validity of the principles enunciated in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article of the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> in reference to blockades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It is true that the instructions of the neutral powers informed their agents that it was &#x0022;essential, under present circumstances, that they should act with great caution in order to avoid raising the question of the recognition of the new Confederation,&#x0022; and that the understanding on the subject did not assume, for that reason, the shape of a formal convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Yet <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government have never sought to take advantage of the obvious imperfections of this blockade in order to declare it ineffective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>They have, to the loss and detriment of the <rs>British</rs> nation, scrupulously observed the duties of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> towards a friendly State.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> Again, on the <date value="1862-09-22">22d September, 1862,</date> the same noble <rs type="role2">Earl</rs> asserted that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were &#x0022;very far indeed&#x0022; from being in &#x0022;a condition to ask other nations to assume that every port of the coasts of the so-styled <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is effectively blockaded.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> When, in view of these facts; of the obligation of the <rs>British</rs> nation to adhere to the pledge made by their Government at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, and renewed to this Confederacy in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; and of these repeated and explicit avowals of the imperfection, irregularity, and inefficiency of the pretended blockade of our coast, I directed our <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> at <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName> to call upon the <rs>British Government</rs> to redeem its promise and to withhold its moral aid and sanction from the flagrant violation of public law committed by our enemies, we were informed that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government could not regard the blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports as having been otherwise than &#x0022;practically effective,&#x0022; in <date value="1862-02">February, 1862,</date> and that &#x0022;the manner in which it has since been enforced gives to neutral Governments no excuse for asserting that the blockade has not been efficiently maintained.&#x0022; We were further informed, when we insisted that by the terms of our agreement no blockade was to be considered effective unless &#x0022;sufficient really to prevent access to our coast,&#x0022; &#x0022;that the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> was, in truth, directed against blockades not sustained by any actual force, or sustained by a notoriously inadequate force, such as the occasional appearance of a man-of-war in the offing for the like.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> It was impossible that this mode of construing an agreement, so as to make its terms mean almost the reverse of what they plainly conveyed, could be considered otherwise than as a notification of the refusal of the <rs>British Government</rs> to remain bound by its agreement, or longer to respect those articles of the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, which had been repeatedly denounced by <name>British</name> statesmen, and had been characterized by <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> as &#x0022;very imprudent&#x0022; and &#x0022;most unsatisfactory.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> If any doubt remained of the motives by which the <rs>British Ministry</rs> have been actuated in their conduct, it would be completely dissipated by the distinct avowals and explanations contained in the published speech recently made by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> for Foreign Affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>In commenting on the remonstrances of this Government against the countenance given to an ineffective blockade, the following language is used: &#x0022;It is said we have, contrary to the declarations of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, contrary to international law, permitted the blockade of <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">3,000 miles</measure> of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It is quite true we did so, and the presumable cause of complaint is quite true, that although the blockade is kept up by a sufficient number of ships, yet these ships were sent into the <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States Navy</orgName> in a hurry, and are ill-fitted for the purpose, and did not keep up so completely and effectively as was required an effective blockade.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> This unequivocal confession of violation, both of agreement with us and of international law, is defended on grounds the validity of which we submit with confidence to the candid judgment of mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> These grounds are thus stated: &#x0022;Still looking at the law of nations it was a blockade we, as a great belligerent power in former times, should have acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>We, ourselves, had a blockade of upwards of <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">2,000 miles</measure>, and it did seem to me that we were bound in justice to the <rs>Federal States</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> to acknowledge that blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>But there was another reason which weighed with me: Our people were suffering severely for the want of that material which was the main staff of their industry, and it was a question of self-interest whether we should not break the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>But in my opinion the men of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would have been forever infamous if, for the sake of their own interest, they had violated the law of nations and made war in conjunction with these slaveholding States of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> against the <rs>Federal States</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> of these reasons our rights are not involved, although it may be permitted to observe that the conduct of Governments has not heretofore, to my knowledge, been guided by the principle that it is infamous to assert their rights when ever the invasion of those rights creates severe suffering among their people and injuriously affects great interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>But the intimation that relations with these States would be discreditable because they are slaveholding would probably have been omitted if the official personage who has published it to the world had remembered that these States were, when colonies, made slaveholding by the direct exercise of the power of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, whose dependencies they were, and whose interests in the slave trade were then supposed to require that her colonies should be made slaveholding. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> But the other ground stated is of a very grave character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>It asserts that a violation of the law of nations by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>, when that Government declared a paper blockade of <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">2,000 miles</measure> of coast, (a violation then defended by her courts and jurists on the sole ground that her action was retaliatory,) affords a justification for a similar outrage on neutral rights by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, for which no palliation can be suggested; and that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> &#x0022;is bound, in jus- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> tice to the <rs>Federal States</rs>, &#x0022;to make return for the war waged against her by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in resistance of her illegal blockade of <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct> by an acquiescence in the <rs>Federal</rs> illegal blockade of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The most alarming feature in this statement is its admission of a just claim on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to require of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, during this war, a disregard of the recognized principles of modern public law and of her own compacts, whenever any questionable conduct of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> &#x0022;in former times&#x0022; can be cited as a precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It is not inconsistent with respect and admiration for the great people whose Government have given us this warning to suggest that their history, like that of mankind in general, offers exceptional instances of indefensible conduct &#x0022;in former times;&#x0022; and we may well deny the morality of violating recent engagements through deference to the evil precedents of the past. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> After defending in the manner just stated the course of the <rs>British Government</rs> on the subject of the blockade, <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Foreign <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> takes case to leave no doubt of the further purpose of the <rs>British Government</rs> to prevent our purchase, of vessels in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> while supplying our enemies with rifles and other munitions of war, and states the intention to apply to Par lament for the furtherance of this design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>He gives to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the assurance that he will do in their favor not only &#x0022;everything that the law of nations requires, everything that the present foreign enlistment act requires,&#x0022; but that he will ask the sanction of Parliament&#x0022;to further measures that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> ministers may still add.&#x0022; This language is so unmistakably an official exposition of the policy adopted by the <rs>British Government</rs> in relation to our affairs, that the duty imposed on me by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of giving you from time to time &#x0022;information of the state of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>,&#x0022; would not have been performed if I had failed to place it distinctly before you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> I refer you for fuller details on this whole subject to the correspondence of the <orgName n="State Department" type="department">State Department</orgName> which accompanies this message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The tacts which I have briefly narrated are.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>No public protest nor opposition, however, has been made by His Imperial Majesty against the prohibition to trade with us imposed on <name>French</name> citizens by the paper blockade of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, although I have reason to believe that an unsuccessful attempt was made on his part to secure the assent of the <rs>British Government</rs> to a course of action more consonant with the dictates of public law and with the demands of justice towards us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> The partiality of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government in favor of our enemies has been further evinced in the marked difference of its conduct on the subject of the purchase of supplies by the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>This difference has been conspicuous since the very commencement of the war. As early as the <date value="1861-05-01">1st May, 1861,</date> the <rs>British Minister</rs> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was informed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that he had sent agents to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and that others would go to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, to purchase arms, and this fact was communicated to the <rs>British</rs> <orgName n="Foreign Office" type="office">Foreign Office</orgName>, which interposed no objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Supported by the confidence and affection of its citizens, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has lacked no element which distinguishes an independent nation according to the principles of public law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> It is due to you and to our country that this full statement should be made of the just grounds which exist for dissatisfaction with the conduct of the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>I am well aware that we are, unfortunately, without adequate remedy for the injustice under which we have suffered at the hands of a powerful nation, at a juncture when our entire resources are absorbed in the defence of our lives, liberties, and independence, against an enemy possessed of greatly superior numbers and material resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Claiming no favor, desiring no aid, conscious of our own ability to defend our own rights against the utmost efforts of an infuriate foe, we had thought it not extravagant to expect that assistance would be withheld from our enemies, and that the conduct of foreign nations would be marked by a genuine impartiality between the belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>It was not supposed that a professed neutrality would be so conducted as to justify the <rs>Foreign Secretary</rs> of the <rs>British</rs> nation in explaining, in correspondence with our enemies, how &#x0022;the impartial observance of neutral obligations by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government has thus been exceedingly advantageous to the cause of the more powerful of the <num value="2">two</num> contending parties.&#x0022; The British Government may deem this war a favorable occasion for establishing, by the temporary sacrifice of their neutral rights, a precedent which shall justify the future exercise of those extreme belligerent pretensions that their naval power renders so formidable.&#x0022; The opportunity for obtaining the tacit assent of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Governments to a line of conduct which ignores the obligations of the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, and treats that instrument rather as a theoretical exposition of principles than a binding agreement, may be considered by the <rs>British Ministry</rs> as justifying them in seeking a great advantage for their own country at the expense of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>But we cannot permit, without protest, the assertion that international law or morals regard as &#x0022;impartial neutrality&#x0022; conduct avowed to be &#x0022;exceedingly advantageous&#x0022; to <num value="1">one</num> of the belligerents. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It is true, that in so doing we should but follow the precedents set by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> in the <name>Berlin</name> and <name>Milan</name> decrees, and the <rs>British</rs> orders in council at the beginning of the present century.--But it must be remembered that we, ourselves, protested against those very measures as signal violations of the law of nations, and declared the attempts to excuse them, on the ground of their being retaliatory, utterly insufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Those blockades are now quoted by writers on public law as a standing reproach on the good name of the nations who were betrayed by temporary exasperation into wrong doing, and ought to be regarded rather as <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> errors to be avoided than as examples to be followed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> The other measure is not open to this objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> article of the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, which provides &#x0022;that the neutral flag covers enemy's goods, with the exception of contraband of war,&#x0022; was a new concession by belligerents in favor of neutrals, and not simply the enunciation of an acknowledged pre-existing rule like the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article, which referred to blockades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>To this concession we bound ourselves by the <rs>Convention</rs> with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, which took the shape of the resolutions adopted by your predecessors on the <date value="1861-08-13">13th August, 1861.</date> The consideration tendered us for that concession has been with-held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>We have, therefore, the undeniable right to refuse longer to remain bound by a compact which the other party refuses to fulfill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>But we should not forget that war is but temporary, and that we desire that peace shall be permanent.--The future policy of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> must ever be to uphold neutral rights to their full extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The principles of the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> commend themselves to our judgment as more just, more humane, and more consonant with modern civilization than those belligerent pretensions which great naval powers have heretofore sought to introduce into the maritime code.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>To forego our undeniable right to the exercise of those pretensions is a policy higher, worthier of us and of our cause than to revoke our adhesion to principles that we approve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Let our hope for redress rest rather on a returning since of justice which cannot fail to awaken a great people to the consciousness that the war in which we are engaged ought rather to be made a reason for forbearance of advantage, than an occasion for the unfriendly conduct of which we make just complaint. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> The events of the last year have produced important changes in the condition of our Southern neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The occupation of the capital of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> by the <rs>French</rs> army, and the establishment of a provisional government, followed by a radical change in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country, have excited lively interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Although preferring our own Government and institutions to those of other countries, we can have no disposition to contest the exercise by them of the same right of self-government which we assert for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> people prefer a monarchy to a republic, it is our plain duty cheerfully to acquiesce in their decision, and to evince a sincere and friendly interest in their prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>If, however, the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexicans</rs> prefer maintaining their former institutions, we have no reason to apprehend any obstacle to the free exercise of their choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>In either event, therefore, we may confidently expect the continuance of those peaceful relations which have been maintained on the frontier, and even a large development of the commerce already existing to the mutual advantage of the <num value="2">two</num> countries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> It has been found necessary since your adjournment to take action on the subject of certain foreign Console within the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The nature of this action and the reasons on which it was based are so fully exhibited in the correspondence of the <orgName n="State Department" type="department">State Department</orgName>, which is transmitted to you, that no additional comment is required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> In connection with this subject of our relations with foreign countries, it is deemed opportune to communicate my views in reference to the treaties made by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at a date anterior to our separation, and which were consequently binding on us as well as on foreign powers when the separation took effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It was partly with a view to entering into such arrangements as the change in our Government had made necessary that we tell it our duty to send Commissioners abroad for the purpose of entering into the negotiations proper to fix the relative rights and obligations of the parties to those treaties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>As this tender on our part has been declined &mdash; as foreign nations have refused us the benefit of the treaties to which we were parties &mdash; they certainly have ceased to be binding on us, and, in my opinion, our relations with <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations are, therefore, now controlled exclusively by the <rs n="General Rules" type="misc">general rules</rs> of the law of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>It is proper to add that these remarks are intended to apply solely to treaty obligations towards foreign Governments, and have no reference to rights of individuals. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The state of the public finances is such as to demand your earliest and most earnest attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>I need hardly say that a prompt and efficacious remedy for the present condition of the currency is necessary to the successful performance of the functions of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Fortunately the resources of our country are so ample, and the spirit of our people so devoted to its cause, that they are ready to make any necessary contribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Relief is thus entirely within our reach if we have the wisdom to legislate in such manner as to render available the means at our disposal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> At the commencement of the war we were tar from anticipating the magnitude and duration of the struggle in which we were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The most sagacious foresight could not have predicted that the passions of the <rs>Northern</rs> people would lead them blindly to the sacrifice of life, treasure, and liberty, in so vain a hope as that of subjugating <num value="13">thirteen</num> independent States, inhabited by many <num value="1000000">millions</num> of people, whose birthright of freedom is dearer to them than life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>A long exemption from direct taxation by the <rs>General Government</rs> had created an aversion to its raising revenue by any other means than by duties on imports, and it was supposed that these duties would be ample for current peace expenditure, while the means for conducting the war could be raised almost exclusively by the use of the public credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> action of the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">Provisional Congress</orgName> was therefore confined to passing a tariff law and to raising a sum of <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num> of dollars by loan, with a pledge of a small export duty on cotton to provide for the redemption of the debt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> At its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> session war was declared to exist between the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and provision was made for the issue of <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of dollars in Treasury notes, and for borrowing <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of dollars on bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The tariff was revised, and preparatory measures taken to enable the <rs>Congress</rs> to levy internal taxation at its succeeding session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>These laws were passed in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, and the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> having joined the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the <rs>Congress</rs> adjourned to meet in the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in the following month of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> Prior to the assembling of your predecessors in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> at their <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> session near the end of <date value="1861-07">July, 1861,</date> the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had developed in his message the purpose &#x0022;to make the centrist a short and a decisive <num value="1">one</num>,&#x0022; and had called on Congress for <num value="400000">400,000</num> men and <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The Congress had exceeded the <rs>Executive</rs> recommendation and had authorized the levy of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of volunteers, besides largely increasing the regular land and naval forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The necessity thus <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> became urgent that a financial scheme should be devised on a basis sufficiently large for the vast proportions of the contest with which we were threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Knowing that the struggle, instead of being &#x0022;short and decisive,&#x0022; would be indefinite in duration, and could only end when the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should awaken from their delusion of conquest, a permanent system was required, fully adapted to the great, exigencies before us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> The plan devised by Congress at that time was based on the theory of issuing Treasury notes convertible at the pleasure of the holder into <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> bonds, the interest of which was to be payable in coin, and it was correctly assumed that any tendency to depreciation that might arise from over issue of the currency would he checked by the constant exercise of the holder's right to fund the notes at a liberal interest payable in specie.--This system depended for success on the continued ability of Government to pay the interest in specie, and means were, therefore, provided for that purpose in the law authorizing the issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>An internal tax termed a war tax was levied, the proceeds of which, together with the revenue from imports, were deemed sufficient for the object designed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>This scheme required for its operation that our commerce with foreign nations should not be suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It was not to be anticipated that such suspension would be permitted otherwise than by an effective blockade; and it was absurd to suppose that a blockade &#x0022;sufficient really to prevent access&#x0022; to our entire coast could be maintained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> We had the means, therefore, (if neutral nations had not combined to aid our enemies by the sanction of an illegal prohibition on their commerce,) to secure the receipt into the <name>Treasury</name> of coin sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds, and thus maintain the <name>Treasury</name> notes at rates nearly equal to par in specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>So long as the interest continued to be thus paid with the reserve of coin pre existing in our country experience sustained the expectations of those who devised the system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Thus, on the <dateStruct value="--1">first</dateStruct> of the following <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> coin had only reached a premium of about <num value="0.2">twenty per cent.</num>, although it had already become apparent that the commerce of the country was threatened with permanent suspension by reason of the conduct of neutral nations, and that the accessary result must be the exhaustion of our specie reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The other agricultural products of the country were at similar moderate rates, thus indicating that there was no excess of circulation, and that the rate of premium on specie was heightened by the exceptional causes which tended to its exhaustion, without the possibility of renewing the supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> This review of the policy of your predecessors is given in justice to them, and it exhibits the condition of the finances at the date when the permanent Government was organized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> In the meantime the popular aversion to internal taxation by the <rs>General Government</rs> had influenced the legislation of the several States, and in only <num value="3">three</num> of them--<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>--were the taxes actually collected from the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The quotas devolving upon the remaining States had been raised by the issue of bonds and State treasury notes, and the public debt of the country was thus actually increased instead of being diminished by the taxation imposed by Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Neither at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> nor <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> session of the present Congress were means provided by taxation for maintaining the <rs>Government</rs>, the legislation being confined to authorizing further sales of bonds and issues of treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Although repeated efforts were made to frame a proper system of <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> taxation, you were confronted with an obstacle which did not exist for your predecessors, and which created grave embarrassment in devising any scheme of taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>About <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the entire taxable property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> consist of lands and slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The general power of taxation vested in Congress by the <rs>Provisional Constitution</rs>, (which was to be only temporary <unclear></unclear> its operation,) was not restricted by any other condition than that &#x0022;all duties, imposts, and excises, should be uniform throughout the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.&#x0022; But the permanent Constitution sanctioning the principle that taxation and representation ought to rest on the same basis, specially provided that &#x0022;representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and including <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> not <unclear></unclear> <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of all slaves.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> It was further ordered that a census should be made within <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting of the <rs>Congress</rs>, and that &#x0022;no capitation or other tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> It is plain that under these provisions capitation and direct taxes must be levied in proportion to the ceases when made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It is also plain that the duty is imposed on Congress to <unclear>pro</unclear> for making a census prior to the <date value="1863-02-22">22d February, 1863.</date> It may further be stated that, according to the received construction of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, (a construction acquiesced in for upwards of <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure>,) taxes on lands and slaves are direct taxes, and the conclusion seems necessarily to be that in repeating without modification, in our Constitution, this language of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, our Convention intended to attach to it the meaning which had been sanctioned by long and uninterrupted acquiescence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> So long as there seemed to be a probability of being able to carry out these provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in their entirety, and in conformity with the intentions of its authors, there was an obvious difficulty in framing any system of taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>A law which should exempt from the burthen <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the property of the country would be as unfair to the owners of the remaining <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> as it would be inadequate to meet the requirements of the public service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> The urgency of the need was such, however, that, after very great embarrassment, and more than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> of assiduous labor, you succeeded in framing the law of the <date value="1863-04- 24">24th April, 1863,</date> by which you sought to reach, so far as practicable, every resource of the country except the capital invested in <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> and slaves, and by means of an income tax and a tax in kind on the produce of the soll, as well as by licenses on business occupations and professions, to command resources sufficient for the wants of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But a very large proportion of these resources could only be made available at the close of the present and the commencement of the ensuing year, while the intervening exigences permitted no delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>In this state of affairs, superinduced almost unavoidably by the fortunes of the war in which we are engaged, the issues of treasury notes have been increased until the currency in circulation amounts to more than <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> of dollars, or more than <num value="3">three</num> fold the amount required by the business of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> I need not enlarge upon the evil effects of this condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>They are unfortunately but too apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>In addition to the difficulty presented to the necessary operations of the <rs>Government</rs>, and the efficient conduct of the war, the most deplorable of all its results is undoubtedly its corrupting influence on the mounds of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The possession of large amounts of treasury notes has naturally led to a desire for investment, and with a constantly increasing volume of currency there has been an equally constant increase of price in all objects of investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>This effect has stimulated purchase by the apparent certainty of profit, and a spirit of speculation has thus been festered which has so debasing an influence and such ruinous consequences that it is our highest duty to remove the cause, and no measures directed to that end can be too prompt or too stringent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> Reverting to the <name>Constitutional</name> provisions already cited the question recurs whether it be possible to execute the duty of apportioning taxation in accordance with the census ordered to be made as a basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>So long as this appeared to be practicable none can deny the propriety of your course in abstaining from the imposition of direct taxes till you could exercise the power in the precise mode pointed out by the terms of the fundamental law. But It is obvious that there are many duties imposed by the <rs>Constitution</rs> which depend for their fulfilment on the undisturbed possession of the territory within which they are to be performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The same instrument which orders a census to be made in all the <name>States</name> imposes the duty on the <rs>Confederacy</rs> &#x0022;to guarantee to every State a <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> form of Government.&#x0022; It enjoins on us &#x0022;to protect each State from invasion,&#x0022; and while declaring that its great objects and purposes are &#x0022;to establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, and secure the blessings of liberty to out selves and our posterity,&#x0022; it confers the means and thereby imposes on us the paramount duty of effecting its intent by &#x0022;laying and collecting taxes, duties, imposts and excises, necessary to pay the debts, provide for the common defence and carry on the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> None would pretend that the <rs>Constitution</rs> is violated because, by reason of the presence of hostile armies, we are unable to guarantee a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> form of government to those States or portions of States now temporality held by the enemy, and as little justice would there be imputing blame for the failure to make the census, when that failure is attributable to causes not foreseen by the authors of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and beyond our control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The general intent of our constitutional charter is unquestionably that the property of the country is to be taxed in order to raise revenue for the common defence, and the special mode provided for levying this tax is impracticable from unforeseen causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It is, in my judgment, our primary duty to execute the general indent expressed by the terms of the instrument which we have sworn to obey, and we cannot excuse ourselves for the failure to fulfill this obligation on the ground that we are unable to perform it in the precise mode pointed out. Whenever it shall be possible to execute our duty in all its parts we must do so in exact compliance with the whole letter and spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Until that period shall arrive we must execute so much of it as our condition renders practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Whenever the withdrawal of the enemy shall place it in our power to make a census and apportionment of direct taxes, any other mode of levying them will be contrary to the will of the law giver, and incompatible with our obligation to obey that will; until that period the alternative left is to obey the paramount precept, and to execute it according to the only other rule provided, which is to &#x0022;make the tax uniform throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> The considerations just presented are greatly enforced by the reflection that any attempt to apportion taxes amongst States, some of which are wholly or partially in the occupation of hostile forces, would subvert the whole intention of the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and be productive of the most revolting injustice, instead of that just correlation between taxation and representation which it was their purpose to secure.--With large portions of some of the <name>States</name> occupied by the enemy, what justice would there be in imposing on the remainder the whole amount of the taxation of the entire State in proportion to its representation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>What else would this be in effect than to increase the burthen of those who are the heaviest sufferers by the war, and to make our own inability to protect them from invasion, as we are required to do by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the ground for adding to their losses by an attempted adherence to the letter, in violation of the spirit, of that instrument?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>No such purpose could have been entertained and no such result contemplated by the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It may add weight to these considerations it we reflect that although the <rs>Constitution</rs> provided that it should go into operation with a representation temporarily distributed among the <name>States</name>, it expressly ordains, after providing for a census within <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, that this temporary distribution of representative power is to endure &#x0022;until <unclear></unclear> enumeration shall be made.&#x0022; Would any <num value="1">one</num> argue that because the census cannot be made within the fixed period the <rs>Government</rs> must, at the expiration of that period, perish for want of a representative body?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>in any aspect in which the subject can be viewed I am led to the conclusion already announced, and which is understood to be in accordance with a vote taken in <num value="1">one</num> or both houses at your last session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>I shall, therefore, until we are able to pursue the precise mode required by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, deem it my duty to approve any law levying the taxation which you are bound to impose for the defence of the country, in any other practicable mode which shall distribute the burthen uniformly and impartially on the whole property of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> In your former legislation you have sought to avoid the increase in the volume of notes in circulation, by offering inducements to voluntary funding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The measures adopted for that purpose have been but partially successful, and the evil has now reached such a magnitude as to permit no other remedy than the compulsory reduction of the currency to the amount required by the business of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>This reduction should be accompanied by a pledge that under no stress of circumstances will that amount be exceeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>No possible mode of using the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> can be so disastrous as <num value="1">one</num> which disturbs the basis of all exchanges, renders impossible all calculations of future values, augments, in constantly increasing proportions, the price of all commodities, and so deprecates all fixed wages, salaries, and incomes, as to render them inadequate to bare subsistence, if to these be added the still more fatal influence on the morals and character of the people, to which I have already adverted, I am persuaded you will concur in the conclusion that an inflexible adherence to a limitation of the currency at a fixed sum is an indispensable element of any system of finance now to be adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> The holders of the currency now outstanding can only be protected in the recovery of their just claims by substituting for their notes some other security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>If the currency is not greatly and promptly reduced, the present scale of inflated prices will not only continue to exist, but by the very fact of the large amounts thus made requisite in the conduct of the war those prices will reach rates still more extravagant and the whole system will full under its own weight, thus rendering the redemption of the debt impossible, and destroying its whole value in the hands of the holder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>If, on the contrary, a funded, debt, with interest secured <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> by adequate taxation can be substituted for the outstanding currency, its entire amount will be made available to the holder, and the <rs>Government</rs> will be in a condition canbling it, beyond the reach of any probable contingency, to prosecute the war to a successful issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It is, therefore, demanded, as well by the interest of the creditor as of the country at large, that the evidences of the public debt now outstanding, in the shape of treasury notes, be converted into bonds, bearing adequate interest, with a provision for taxation sufficient to ensure punctual payment, and final redemption of the whole debt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> presents the outlines of a system which, in conjunction with existing legislation, is intended to secure the several objects of a reduction of the circulation within fixed, reasonable limit; of providing for the future wants of the <rs>Government</rs>; of furnishing security for the punctual payment of interest and final extinction of the principal of the public debt; and of placing the whole business of the country on a basis as near a specie standard as is possible during the continuance of the war. I earnestly recommend it to your consideration, and that no delay be permitted to intervene before your action on this vital subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>I trust that it will be suffered to engross your attention until you shall have disposed of it in the mannar best adapted to attain the important results which your country anticipates from your legislation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> It may be added that, in considering this subject, the people ought steadily to keep in view that the <rs>Government</rs> in contracting debt is but their agent: that its debt is their debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>As the currency in held exclusively by ourselves, it is obvious that, if each person hold treasury notes in exact proportion to the value of his whole means, each would in fact owe himself the amount of the notes held by him, and, were it possible to distribute the currency alone, to an amount sufficient to reduce it to proper limits, would afford the best of all remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Under such circumstances, the notes remaining in the hands of each holder, after the payment of his tax, would be worth quite as much as the whole sum previously held, for it would purchase at least an equal amount of commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>This result cannot be perfectly attained by any device of legislation, but it can be approximated by taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>A tax on all values has for its effect not only to impose a due share of the burthen on the note holder, but to force those who have few or none of the notes to part with a share of their possessions to those who hold the notes in excess, in order to obtain the means of satisfying the demands of the tax-gatherer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>This is the only mode by which it is practicable to make all contribute as equally as possible in the burthen which all are bound to share; and it is for this reason that taxation adequate to the public exigencies, under our present circumstances, must be the basis of any funding system or other remedy for restoring stability to our finances. </p> </div4>

<head>The army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> To the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> you are referred for details relative to the condition of the army, and the measures of legislation required for maintaining its efficiency, recruiting its numbers, and furnishing the supplies necessary for its support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> Though we have lost many of the best of our soldiers and most patriotic of our citizens, (the sad but unavoidable result of the parties and tolls of such a campaign as that which will render the year <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> ever memorable in our annals,) the army is believed to be in all respects in better condition than at any previous period of the war. Our gallant defenders, now veterans, familiar with danger, hardened by exposure, and confident in themselves and their officers, endure privations with cheerful fortitude, and welcome battle with alacrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The officers, by experience in field service, and the action of examining boards in relieving the incompetent, are now greatly more efficient than at the commencement of the war. The assertion is believed to be fully justified that, regarded as a whole, for character, valor, efficiency, and patriotic devotion, our army has not been equalled by any like number of troops in the history of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> In view of the large conscription ordered by the enemy, and their subsequent call for volunteers, to be followed, if ineffectual, by a still further draft, we are admonished that no effort must be spared to add largely to our effective force as promptly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The sources of supply are to be found by restoring to the army all who are improperly absent, putting an end to substitution, modifying the exemption law, restricting details, and placing in the ranks such of the able bodied men now employed as wagoners, nurses, cooks, and other employees as are doing service for which the negroes may be found competent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The act of <date value="1862-04-16">16th April; 1862,</date> provides &#x0022;that persons not liable for duty may be received as substitutes for those who are, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.&#x0022; The policy of granting this privilege has not been sustained by experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Not only has the numerical strength of the army been seriously impaired by the frequent desertions for which substitutes have become notorious, but dissatisfaction has been excited among those who have been unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of avoiding the military service of their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> I fully concur in the opinion expressed by the <rs>Secretary</rs>, that there is no ground for the objection that a new provision, to include those who furnished substitutes under the former call, would be a breach of contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>To accept a substitute was to confer a privilege, not to enter into a contract; and whenever the substitute is rendered liable to conscription it would seem to follow that the principal, whose place he had taken, should respond for him, as the <rs>Government</rs> had received no consideration for his exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Where, however, the new provision of law would fall to embrace a substitute now in the ranks, there appears, if the principal should again be conscribed, to be an equitable ground for compensation to the conscript, who then would have added to the service a soldier not otherwise liable to enrollment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> On the subject of exemptions, it is believed that abuses cannot be checked unless the system is placed on a basis entirely different from that now provided by law. The object of your legislation has been, not to confer privileges on classes, but to exonerate from military duty such number of persons skilled in the various trades, professions, and mechanical pursuits, as could render more valuable service to their country by laboring in their present occupation than by going into the ranks of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The policy is unquestionable; but the result would, it is thought, be better obtained by enrolling all such persons and allowing details to be made of the number necessary to meet the wants of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Considerable numbers are believed to be now exempted from the military service who are not needful to the public in their civil vocation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> Certain duties are now performed throughout the country by details from the army, which could be as well executed by persons above the present conscript age. An extension of the limit, so as to embrace persons over <measure n="45years" type="date">forty five years</measure>, and physically fit, for service in guarding posts, railroads, and bridges, in apprehending deserters, and, where practicable, assuming the place of younger men detailed for duty with the alter, ordnance, commissary, and quartermaster's bureaus of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, would, it is hoped, add largely to the effective force in the field, without an undue burthen on the population. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> If to the above measures be added a law to enlarge the policy of the act of the <date value="1862-04-21">21st April, 1862,</date> so as to enable the department to replace not only <unclear></unclear> cooks, but wagoners and other employees in the army, by negroes, it is hoped that the ranks of the army will be so strengthened for the ensuing campaign as to put af defiance the utmost efforts of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> In order to maintain, unimpaired, the existing organization of the army until the close of the war, your legislation contemplated a frequent supply of recruits, and it was expected that before the expiration of the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> for which the men were enrolled under act of <date value="1862-04-16">16th April, 1862,</date> the majority of men in each company would consist of those who joined it at different dates subsequent to the original master of the company into service, and that the discharge of those who had completed their term would at no time be sufficient to leave the company with a less number then in required to enable it to retain its organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The difficulty of obtaining recruits from certain localities, and the large number of exemptions from military service granted by different laws, have prevented sufficient accessions in many of the companies to preserve their organizations after the discharge of the original members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The advantage of retaining tried and well-approved officers and of mingling recruits with experienced soldiers, is no obvious, and the policy of such a course is no clearly indicated, that it is not deemed necessary to point out the evil consequences which would result from the destruction of the old organizations, or to dwell upon the benefits to be secured from fitting up the veteran companies as long before the discharge of the <name>Cartier</name> member as may be possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>In the cases where it may be found impracticable to maintain regiments in sufficient strength to justify the retention of the present organization, economy and efficiency would be promoted by consolidation and reorganization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>This would involve the necessity of disbanding a part of the officers, and making regulations for accruing the most judicious selection of those who are retained, while least wounding the feelings of those who are discharged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> Experience has shown the necessity for further legislation in relation to the horses of the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Many men loss their horses by casualties of service which are not included in the provisions made to compensate the owner for the loss, and it may thus not unfrequently happen that the most officiant troopers, without fault of their own &mdash; indeed, it may be because of their zeal and activity &mdash; are lost to the cavalry service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> It would also seem proper that the <rs>Government</rs> should have complete control over every horse <unclear></unclear> into service, with the limitation that the owner should not be deprived of his horse except upon due compensation being made therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Otherwise, mounted men may not keep horses fit for the service and the question whether they should serve mounted or on foot would depend not upon the qualifications of the men, but upon the fact of their having horses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> Some provision is deemed requisite to correct the evils arising from the long continued absence of commissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Where it is without sufficient cause, it would seem but just that the commission should be thereby vacated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>This might he done by temporary appointments, to endure only until the return of the officers regularly commissioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Where it results from permanent disability, incurred in the line of their duty, it would be proper to retire them and fill the vacancies according to established mode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>I would also suggest the organization of an invalid corps, and that the retched officers be transferred to it. Such a corps, it is thought, could be made useful in various employments for which efficient officers and troops are now detached. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> An organization of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> of the army would be highly conducive to the efficiency of that most important branch of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The plan adopted for the military establishment furnishes a model for the staff of the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName>, it be deemed advisable to retain the distinction; but I recommend to your consideration the propriety of abolishing it, and providing for the organization of the several staff corps in such number and with such rank as will meet all the wants of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>To secure the requisite ability for the more important positions it will be accessary to provide for officers of higher rank than is now authorized for these corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>To give so the officers the proper relation and co-intelligence in their respective corps, and to preserve in the chief of each useful influence and control over his subordinates, there should be no gradation on the basis of the rank of the <rs>General</rs> with whom they might be serving by appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>To the personal staff of a General it would seem proper to give a grade corresponding with his rank, and the number might be sized to correspond with his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>To avoid the consequence of discharge upon a change of duty, the variable portion of the personal staff might be taken from the line of the army and allowed to retain their line commissions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> The disordered condition of the currency to which I have already alluded has imposed on the <rs>Government</rs> a system of supplying the wants of the army which is so unequal in its operation, vexatious to the producer, injurious to the industrial interest, and productive of such discontent among the people, as only to be justified by the existence of an absolute necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The report of the <rs>Secretary</rs> on this point establishes conclusively that the necessity which has forced the bureau of supply to provide for the army by impressment has resulted from the impossibility of purchase by contrast or in the open market, except at such rapidly impressed rates as would have rendered the appropriations inadequate to the wants of the army. --Indeed, it is believed that the temptation to hoard supplies for the higher prices, which could be anticipated with certainty, has been checked mainly by the fear of the operation of the impressment law, and that commodities have been offered in the markets principally to escape impressment and obtain higher rates than those fixed by appraisement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The complaints against this vicious system have been well founded, but the true cause of the evil has been misapprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The remedy is to be found, not in a change of the impressment law, but in the restoration of the currency to such a basis as will enable the department to purchase necessary supplies in the open market, and thus render impressment rare and exceptional process. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> The same remedy will effect the result universally desired of an augmentation of the pay of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The proposals made at your previous sessions to increase the pay of the soldier by an additional amount of Treasury notes would have conferred little <unclear></unclear> on him, but a radical reform of the currency <unclear></unclear> restore the pay to a value approximating that which it originally had, and materially improve his condition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> The reports from the <name>Ordnance</name> and Mining Bureaux are very gratifying, and the extension of our means of supply of arms and munitions of war from our home resources has been such as to insure our ability soon to become mainly, if not entirely, independent of supplies from foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The establishments for the casting of guns and projectiles, for the manufacture of small arms and of gunpowder, for the supply of nitre from artificial nitre bede, and mining operations generally, have been so distributed through the country as to place our resources beyond the reach of partial disasters. </p>

<head>Exchange of prisoners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> Pregret to inform you that the enemy have returned to the barbarous policy with which they inaugurated the war, and that the exchange of prisoners has been for some time suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The correspondence of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> of Exchange is submitted to you by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and it has already been published for the information of all now suffering useless imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The conduct of the authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has been consistently perfidious on this subject.--An agreement for exchange in the incipiency of the war had just been concluded when the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> reversed the previous state of things, and gave them an excess of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The agreement was immediately repudiated by them, and so remained till the fortune of war again placed us in possession of the larger number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>A new cartel was then made, and under it, for many mouths, we restored to them many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of prisoners in excess of those whom they hold for exchange, and encampments of surplus paroled prisoners delivered up by us were established in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, where the men were able to receive the comforts and solace of constant communication with their homes and families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>In <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> last the fortunes of war again favored the enemy, and they were enabled to exchange for duty the men previously delivered to them, against those captured and paroled at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The prisoners taken at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, however, remained in their hands, and should have been at once returned to our lines on parole, to await exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Instead of executing a duty imposed by the plainest dictates of justice and good faith, pretexts were instantly sought for holding them in permanent captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>General orders rapidly succeeded each other from the bureaux at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, placing new constructions on an agreement which had given rise to no dispute while we retained the advantage in the number of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>With a disregard of honorable obligations almost unexampled the enemy did not hesitate, in addition to retaining the prisoners captured by them, to declare null the paroles given by the prisoners captured by us in the same series of engagements, and liberated on condition of not again serving until exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They have since openly insisted on treating the paroles given by their own soldiers as invalid, and those of our soldiers, given under precisely similar circumstances, as binding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>A succession of similar unjust pretensions has been set up in a correspondence tediously prolonged, and every device employed to cover the disregard of an obligation which, between belligerent nations, is only to be enforced by a sense of honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> No further comment is needed on this subject; but it may be permitted to direct your special attention to the close of the correspondence submitted to you, from which you will perceive that the final proposal made by the enemy, in settlement of all disputes under the cartel, is, that we should liberate all prisoners held by us, without the offer to release from captivity any of those held by them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> In the meantime a systematic and concerted effort has been made to quiet the complaints in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of those relatives and friends of the prisoners in our hands who are unable to understand why the cartel is not executed in their favor, by the groundless assertion that we are the parties who refuse compliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Attempts are also made to shield themselves from the execration excited by their own odious treatment of our officers and soldiers now captive in their hands, by misstatements, such as that the prisoners held by us are deprived of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>To this last accusation the conclusive answer has been made that, in accordance with our law and general orders of the department, the rations of the prisoners are precisely the same, in quantity and quality, as those served out to our own gallant soldiers in the field, and which have been found sufficient to support them in their arduous campaign, while it is not pretended by the enemy that they treat prisoners by the same generous rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>By an indulgence, perhaps unprecedented, we have even allowed the prisoners in our hands to be supplied by their friends at home with comforts not enjoyed by the men who captured them in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>In contrast to this treatment the most revolting inhumanity has characterized the conduct of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> towards prisoners held by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It is gratifying to perceive that the department has thus been made self-sustaining in accordance with sound principle, and with the express requirement of the <rs>Constitution</rs> that its expenses should be paid out of its own revenues after the <date value="1863-03-01">1st March, 1863.</date> </p>

<head>Conduct of the enemy.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> I cannot close this message without again adverting to the savage ferocity which still marks the conduct of the enemy in the prosecution of the war. After their repulse from the defences before <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sought revenge by an abortive attempt to destroy the city with an incendiary composition, thrown by improved artillery, from a distance of <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> Failing in this they changed their missiles, but fortunately have thus far succeeded only in killing <num value="2">two</num> women in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> Nor has less unrelenting warfare been waged by these pretended friends of human rights and liberties against the unfortunate negress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Wherever the enemy have been able to gain access they have forced into the ranks of their army every able-bodied man that they could seize, and have either left the aged, the women, and the children, to perish by starvation, or have gathered them into camps where they have been wasted by a frightful mortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Without clothing or shelter, often without food, incapable, without supervision, of taking the most ordinary precautions against disease, these helpless dependents, accustomed to have their wants supplied by the foresight of their masters, are being rapidly exterminated wherever brought in contact with the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>By the <rs>Northern</rs> man, on whose deep rooted prejudices no kindly restraining influence is exercised, they are treated with aversion and neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>There is little hazard in predicting that, in all localities where the enemy have gained a temporary foothold, the negroes, who under our care increased <num value="6">six</num>-told in number since their importation into the <name>Colonies</name> by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, will have been reduced by mortality, during the war, to not more than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> their previous number. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> Information on this subject is derived not only from our own observation and from reports of the negroes who succeed in escaping from the enemy, but full confirmation is afforded by statements published in the <rs>Northern</rs> journals by humane persons engaged in making appeals to the charitable for aid in preventing the ravages of disease, exposure, and starvation among the negro women and children who are crowded into encampments. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Its whole aspect is a comment on the ethics of the <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> issued by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> on the <date value="1863-04-24">24th of April, 1863,</date> comprising &#x0022;instructions for the government of armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the field,&#x0022; and of which the following is an example: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> &#x0022;Military necessity admits of all direct destruction of life or limb of <hi rend="italics">armed</hi> enemies, and of other persons whose destruction is incidentally <hi rend="italics">unavoidable</hi> in the armed contests of the war; it allows of the capturing of every armed enemy and of every enemy of importance to the hostile Government, or of peculiar danger to the captor; it allows of all destruction of property and obstructions of the ways and channels of traffic, travel, or communication, and of all withholding of sustenance or means of life from the enemy; of the appropriation of whatever an enemy's country affords necessary for the subsistence and safety of the army; and of such deception as does not involve the breaking of good faith, either positively pledged regarding agreements entered into during the war, or supposed by the modern law of war to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Men who take up arms against <num value="1">one</num> another in public war do not cease on this account to be moral beings, responsible to <num value="1">one</num> another and to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> The striking contrast to these teachings and practices presented by our army when invading <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> Illustrates the moral character of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Though their forbearance may have been unmerited and unappreciated by the enemy, it was imposed by their own self-respect, which forbade their degenerating from <name>Christian</name> warriors into plundering ruffians, assailing the property, lives, and honor of helpless non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>If their conduct, when thus contrasted with the inhuman practices of our foe, fail to command the respect and sympathy of civilized nations in our day, it cannot fail to be recognized by their less deceived posterity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> The hope last year entertained of an early termination of the war has not been realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Could carnage have satisfied the appetite of our enemy for the destruction of human life, or grief have appeased their wanton desire to inflict human suffering, there has been bloodshed enough on both sides, and <num value="2">two</num> lands have been sufficiently darkened by the weeds of mourning to induce a disposition for peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> If unanimity in a people could dispel delusion, it has been displayed too unmistakably not to have silenced the pretence that the <rs>Southern States</rs> were merely disturbed by a factions insurrection, and it must long since have been admitted that they were but exercising their reserved right to modify their own Government in such manner as would best secure their own haplessly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>But these considerations have been powerless to allay the unchristian hate of those who, long accustomed to draw large profits from a union with us, cannot control the rage excited by the conviction that they have by their own folly destroyed the richest resources of their prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>They refuse even to listen to proposals for the only peace possible between us &mdash; a peace which, recognizing the impassable gulf which divides us, may leave the <num value="2">two</num> peoples separately to recover from the injuries inflicted on both by the causeless war now waged against us. Having begun the war in direct violation of their Constitution, which forbade the attempt to coerce a State, they have been hardened by crime until they no longer attempt to vell their purpose to destroy the institutions and subvert the sovereignty and independence of these States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We now know that the only reliable hope for peace is in the vigor of our resistance, as the cessation of their hostility is only to be expected from the pressure of their necessities. </p>

<head>The war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> This war has now been in progress nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. Whatever of respect, or confidence, or affection existed at the commencement of our troubles, has been effectually crushed and forever destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>There is not even the shadow of a possibility that respect can be revived, or confidence restored, or affection renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The chain that bound us together has been broken, and can never be reunited &mdash; the magnificent structure reared by our wise and patriotic forefathers has fallen into ruins, and it can never be reconstructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The Union they formed, the <rs>Government</rs> they established, have had their allotted time, and are now numbered with the things that are gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>A people imbued with sound principles and animated by a proper spirit, who hate us with the intensity which the <rs>Northern</rs> people have exhibited, and who know that we detest them, would not desire a longer alliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Honor, justice, propriety &mdash; every consideration that should influence good and patriotic men, show the necessity of our eternal separation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> It is said we have some men amongst us who are the advocates of what they call an honorable price, which, when properly interpreted, means nothing more nor less than submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It is pleasant to know that the number of such men is small; but whether large or small, spurn them as you would the viper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Men who preach peace under present circumstances are false to us and to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>It is time enough to speak of an honorable peace when <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> shall have withdrawn his armies from our soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> *** So far we have accomplished all, nay, more than we could have reasonably anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>We have an army in the field well appointed and well equipped, unsurpassed in spirit, unequalled in devotion to the cause, enured to service, disciplined, true, and courageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Our people, old and young, male and female, are of <num value="1">one</num> mind in their hatred of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and in their determination to separate from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Can such a people be brought under a tyrant's power, and be forced to submit to a tyrant's exactions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Can such a people be conquered and subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Never! </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Exemptions from service.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> Men who had no right to ask or expect exemption from active service in the field are round comfortably ensconced in the commissary or quartermasters departments, or in the lying-in hospitals, prepared by the nitre and mining bureau, which has scattered its operations over the whole face of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>All these places could be filled with infinitely more advantage and profit to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by men of age, experience, and matured judgment, who are beyond the military age and unfit for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Young men in too many instances hold such positions, and justice demands that they should be in their appropriate places in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The fact that these men are kept in such positions, for which they possess no superior qualifications over hundreds of others exempt from military duty by reason of age or physical disability, operate prejudicially to the public interest, and sows the seeds of dissension and strife, which will sooner or later produce a harvest of mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>These may be regarded by some as unimportant matters, but still they are worthy of consideration, and it is to be hoped will be speedily changed and corrected.--The public interest demands this, and what the public interest demands no representative of the people should be afraid to execute. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Impressments.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> The manner in which the impressment system has been conducted has produced incalculable mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The agents detected have too frequently been men who possessed neither manners nor business qualifications, and the result has been that they have caused in the minds of multitudes of well-meaning men great dissatisfaction with the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>If men of age, experience, and practical judgment were selected to fill these positions, the ends which the <rs>Government</rs> has in view would be accomplished, and no prejudice in the public mind would be created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Young and inexperienced hands have too often been charged with the execution of this branch of business, and from all I have learned I am satisfied that they have not unfrequently been sent out without the necessary written instruction, and the manner in which their duties have been performed has created the utmost dissatisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Legislation is required for the protection of our people against the impositions practiced by impressment officers and persons claiming to be such, and I trust it will be had at this session. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head>Reunion and reconstruction.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Reunion and reconstruction are but synonyms for submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The man who can assent to reunion or reconstruction, is unworthy to enjoy the blessings of liberty and free principles, and deserves to suffer the horrors of subjugation at the hands of our vandal enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>They have already proclaimed the purpose to strip us of our slave property; and as far as this purpose could be accomplished by them, they have removed it, in common with every other species of property.--They have destroyed our dwellings, devastated our lands, and avowed their purpose to staive us into submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>They have omitted no opportunity to wreak their vengeance upon unoffending women and innocent children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Even the implements of husbandry have been destroyed, as <num value="1">one</num> of the means of accomplishing the starvation of our people and their devilish work of extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>When a chaplain in the <rs>Federal</rs> army can avow the atrocious sentiment that if the extinction of slavery requires the extinction of the slaveholder, he was for his extinction, what can we expect from a people represented by such a clergy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Any fate would be preferable to union with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>They are deaf to all appeals for justice, insensible to all the claims of humanity, indifferent alike to all social, moral, and <name>Christian</name> principles, and recklessly bent upon the extinction of a people whose blood in many instances flows in their own veins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Can we again reunite with them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Can we aid in the reconstruction of a Government which is to be common to us and to them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Every consideration of duty to our <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to ourselves, and to our posterity forbids it. Our peace, our happiness, the prosperity of our country forbid it. As friends and advocates of liberty, independence, and the principles of free government, our judgment, our feelings &mdash; all the nobler impulses of our nature &mdash; rebel against the idea of reunion and reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Every blow struck by our enemy since this cruel war began has only intensified the more deeply our hatred towards them and their hatred towards us, and has widened and deepened the guilt between us and them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>We are now separated, and the public sentiment of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is that we shall remain as we are. It we are to form a union with any people, let it be with some nation of high toned honor and elevated principles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/> The indications admonish us that this war may continue for some time to come, and that we shall be called upon to endure much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It behooves us, therefore, to be patient, firm, and energetic, self-sacrificing and determined, and to omit nothing calculated to aid in securing success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The occasion, the cause, and the hopes and expectations which success inspires, appeal to all to redouble their exertions, their energies, and their efforts.--If we determine with fixed and resolute purpose to succeed, and if we move as <num value="1">one</num> man in everything that is required to sustain the cause, we cannot fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>A people resolved to be free can never die slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>All the glorious recollections that adorn the history of our ancestry, and gave to them, in the eyes and estimation of mankind, dignity and character &mdash; all the sufferings which have been inflicted upon our people; all the bright anticipations which crowd the future, and which promise peace, prosperity, and happiness to us and our posterity, appeal to us to be true and faithful to ourselves and our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The people will be true, and the day of deliverance will come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>It is useless to attempt to conceal the fact that the <rs>Northern</rs> people are as thoroughly united and determined as we are, and it is proper to look the matter sternly in the face, and make our preparations to meet it with equal firmness and decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>No people ever lost anything by properly estimating the power and strength of an adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>We are thus better prepared to maintain our rights, and we can do it with greater success and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Many a battle has been lost, because the power and number, and preparations of the enemy were under-estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It is always wise to look danger fully in the face, and meet it calmly, with spirit and decision, energy and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Prudence, industry, judgment, and patriotism, will save us and the cause, and establish independence upon a firm basis. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> Encourage a proper spirit; inculcate harmony, unity, and conciliation, and all will be well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Victory will crown our efforts, and the end will be liberty, independence, and the establishment of free government, that will insure happiness to our people and prosperity to our country. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="5"> 
<head>Substitutes.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> When this war commenced I was opposed to the substitute system, and my opinion was well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>But in opposition to my wishes and views, it was adopted by the <rs>State</rs> and Confederate authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Substitutes have been tendered and accepted for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, under the laws both of the <rs>State</rs> and Confederacy: and the policy having been established, whether right or wrong, it is now too late to controvert it. Under the action of both Governments it became a binding and subsisting contract, and as such should be respected and observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Contracts between Governments and individuals should at all times be held sacred and inviolable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>No Government which violates them can long maintain its character for honor or integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>When these are forfeited by a Government, the public confidence in it is at an end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> Many of these substitutions, as I understand, are now disregarded and set aside, notwithstanding the fact that the parties have paid large sums to obtain the men who are to fill their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>This is done upon the idea that the <name>States</name> had no right or authority to receive substitutes even before the troops were turned over to the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>If such be the doctrine, I enter my protest against it, and leave it to the parties to controvert the question before the <rs type="place">Courts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>There the applications will receive a hearing, and will, I have no doubt, be fairly and justly decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>I recommend the subject to your consideration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/> I am in favor of every man doing his duty in this war, but at the same time I am equally in favor of the inviolability of contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>When the <rs>Government</rs> makes an agreement with a party, good faith requires that it should respect it and carry it out. No Government which shows a disregard of its voluntarily incurred obligations can hope to prosper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Honesty, fair dealing, and a strict compliance with obligations, assure confidence, and unite the people firmly to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>I trust, therefore, that the conscript bureen will give to this question the most serious consideration before further steps are taken. </p> </div4>

<head>The Impalement of slaves to work on the fortifications.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond city</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2002180" n="1.000 8" reg="pittsylvania, virginia, united states">Pittsylvania county</placeName> have fitted to send their quota of slaves under the call for negroes to work on the fortifications. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The people generally complete that the provision of the law, which requires the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to pay the value of such slaves as may air, or not be returned to their owners, has not been complied with, and they therefore have no guaranies that slaves now sent, if lost, will be paid for. The reason assigned to me for non-payment has been that Congress had made no appropriation for this object, and that payment could not be made until a bill appropriating the amount necessary had become a law. Within the last few days I have been informed that it is the opinion of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> that all such claims must be heard before the <orgName n="Claims Court" type="court">Court of Claims</orgName> when that Court shall be organized, and that no payments can be made without a favorable judgment pronounced by such tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Such a construction seems to me to be at war not only with the spirit but also with the letter of the law requiring the <rs>Executive</rs> to comply with the <rs>President</rs>'s requisition. </p>
