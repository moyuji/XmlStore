<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>His last letter to his paper dwells upon this point so much that, if he is to be accepted as authority, we may assume that those members who can take it will be admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But we incline to the opinion that this is a sort of middle ground that he is occupying between the <rs>President</rs> and the majority in Congress, and from which he can hereafter go over to either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There are unfortunately a few men in Congress who would like to see the present abnormal condition of things protracted; they do not scruple to speak of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as conquered and <unclear></unclear> air of the <name>Austrian</name> bureaux; and they express a willingness to hold them in vassalage for an indefinite period of time.
