<head><placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> &mdash; the enemy repulsed.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We publish the gratifying news this morning of the repulse of the enemy at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The &#x0022;situation&#x0022; is of course still deeply interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>What will the enemy attempt next in his position on the Big Black?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>What are his abilities after his campaigning and repulse there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>What are our forces about?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>and if he is compelled again to withdraw, will he be allowed to effect his long retreat with success?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>All these questions arise, and no <num value="1">one</num> here can answer except with conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We trust to our men and their commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The valor which so often repulsed him may, guided by such a man as <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,P.,P.,,:1"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, achieve something more than a repulse of the enemy, now that he is so far inland from his base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Let us hope that this event is fully as severe to the enemy as represented, and that our brilliant defence of a Gibraltar so often fruitlessly assailed may be turned now into a crushing disaster to the merciless invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>To him <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is a most trouble some place &mdash; a nuisance of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Every failure to reduce it but increases his rage and his malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He returns from each defeat with greater appliances in gunboats and machinery (at which he is especially great, and upon which he is especially reliant,) and increased numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He hurls all his accumulated force with accumulated bitterness and desperation upon the devoted city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But each assault is met with the true valor and constancy of Southern soldiers, and repulsed with terrible effect to the assailant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>How long he will continue to renew his attacks upon such a place, so gloriously defended, remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> malignity certainly never dies, and if his final abandonment of his purpose upon <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> depended upon the subsidence of this passion (not his worst by any means) he would be forever before the walls of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But there is another motive which has something to do with his acts which may even govern his malignity that is his detestation of all unprofitable enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If he finds that attacking <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> pays not, neither directly nor indirectly, he may in time give it up with a malediction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But should he ever get the opportunity to vent his wrath upon that place of immortal fame, he will not leave <num value="1">one</num> stone upon another to tell where it stood. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The telegram received here on Friday about <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was gloomy enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>During the day, as no news was received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and none by anybody confirming it, it was doubted generally; and on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, as there was still no confirmation, people begin to suspect that speculators were shaping the telegraphic messages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Sugar went up rapidly and the market was quite excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>People looked at sugar and they looked at the telegraph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Although bad news from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> would very naturally affect sugar, they were illiberal enough to reverse the usual course of cause and effect and assume that the rise in sugar had caused the bad news! --Whether the logic be good or not, it is clear that the news was <hi rend="italics">gloomy beyond warrant</hi> and that sugar did <hi rend="italics">rise!</hi> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The record to specify the nature of the acts thus meriting entry upon its pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The proposition met with the unanimous approval of both Houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In the course of his remarks in its support, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> R. expressed the opinion that while other times and other nations had produced instances of the expenditure of life under the combination of animal courage and discipline equal to our war, and indeed instances of brave struggles whose moral grandeur might claim close kindred with the sacrificial devotion which has been displayed on all our battle fields; yet of an army so large as ours, or anything like it, fighting from individual conviction of the justice of their cause &mdash; from an intelligent devotion to the principles of liberty and independence &mdash; the past affords no single instance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> &#x0022;We should,&#x0022; he concluded &#x0022;preserve from oblivion the memory of these men and of their illustrious deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The actors and the witnesses are fast passing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Justice to them demands such a reward at our hands, while I believe it will be hailed with approval by every man, woman, and every child, indeed, old enough to appreciate the virtues it will commemorate, through all our land, and by those who are to come after us. The preparation of this &#x0027;Book of Honor&#x0027; will be in the hands of those who are most competent, and will have every motive to do the work faithfully and well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It will be an invaluable resource to the historian who shall hereafter draw from it the anthentic materials of the story of these eventful times and of the high and chivalrous deeds of our sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It seems to me, sir, that at this moment, when we are about closing our labors &mdash; when the last sands of the political being of this Legislature are fast running out &mdash; it is particularly meant that we should show, by some public act of grateful recognition, that our eyes, thoughts, and feelings are still turned to our brave defenders in the field.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>They left scarcely a horse or mule in the county, and burnt several flouring mills, declaring their determination to stop farming operations, and to prevent the grinding of what wheat might be raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They took from the person of a gentleman a fine gold watch, and on his complaining to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, he was told that if he could point out the man who had the watch it should be returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The guilty party was at once designated, but by the officer, who was as great a thief as himself, was permitted to lie out of the scrape, and retain the watch.
