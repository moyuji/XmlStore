<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We are yet without any authentic particulars of the great <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle at Manassas</rs> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>There a nothing really reliable to be added to the dispatch of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:3"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to the <rs>President</rs> which appeared yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>That our forces have obtained a signal triumph over the combined armies of the enemy, there is no room to doubt; but how far this decisive victory has been followed up, was not known up to the hour of going to press last night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Reports, as usual, were abundant and favorable, and if we were to credit <num value="0.5">one-half</num> that were in circulation last evening, we might reasonably conclude that our army is now in a position to demand the surrender of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In the present condition of affairs, however, these statements are to be received with great allowance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Passengers by the train yesterday afternoon state that it was currently reported at <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, that the <rs>Federal</rs> <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> and <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:McDowell,Slegell,,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> had been slightly and banks mortally wounded at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and that <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName>, the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> General who figured so conspicuously in the <rs>Missouri</rs> campaign, had been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>These reports may be correct, but there is no official information upon which to base them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It was further rumored that we had captured some <measure n="7000" type="prisoners">seven thousand prisoners</measure>, all of whom were paroled on the field of battle, and that the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName></orgName> had advanced as far as <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We of course have no means of ascertaining the reliability of these reports, and only give them as we have obtained them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>without asking that they be received with the most implicit confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Passengers also asserted, with apparent sincerity, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had fired the <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and blown up the aqueduct at <placeName reg="Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7015724">Georgetown</placeName>; but, as far as or inquiries extended, there was no sufficient grounds upon which to rest these assertions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> As stated, we have no doubt of the triumph of our arms, nor have we any doubt that our triumph has been signal and glorious; but beyond that nothing is really known, and all else with reference to the condition of affairs at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and beyond that point is mere conjecture. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> It turns out that the cannonading heard nearly all day yesterday, by persons in <placeName reg="Fairfax, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7014160">Fairfax county</placeName>, was that of an engagement between <orgName n="Scanion's Brigade"><persName n="Scanion,Brigade,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Scanion,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigade"></roleName><surname>Scanion</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Cox,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Cox,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cox</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, and a force of the rebels, considerably outnumbering them, at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, the contest being for the possession of the railroad bridge at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>We believe that the rebels retained possession of it at nightfall, but have every reason to think that Scanion must have dislodged them from it at an early hour this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Last night he certainly expected to be able to do so. Our impression is that his loss throughout the day's skirmishing was inconsiderable. </p> </q><bibl n="The Washington Star,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> The main engagement of yesterday, however, was that of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, with a considerable rebel force, at <orgName n="Bristow Station" type="station">Bristow Station</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> It appears that the movement of the enemy on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, from the <rs>South</rs> bank of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName>, via Jeffersontown, in the direction of Little Washington, was actually designed to throw most of the rebel army across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> at the base of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This was done, and it is this morning ascertained here that it was yesterday morning, probably, for the most part, massed at or near <placeName reg="White Plains, Brunswick, Virginia" key="tgn,2115039">White Plains</placeName>, in the valley between the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> and <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> ranges, <num value="7">seven</num> or <placeName><distance reg="9miles">nine miles</distance> <offset>northeast</offset> of  <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName></placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> At an early hour yesterday morning <orgName n="division"><persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> (doubtless dispatched to that point by <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> on account of the affair there the night before) came up with a large rebel force about <orgName n="Bristow Station" type="station">Bristow Station</orgName>, with whom he had a heavy engagement, lasting nearly all day. In the course of it <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> drove the enemy, step by step, back to the vicinity of <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Our loss in killed, wounded and missing, in the day's engagement there, was about <num value="300">300</num>. <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> is said to regard the affair as a signal Union success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> It is evident from these facts that the late skirmishes on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> were little more than feints on the part of the rebels, who aimed to get in between <orgName n="army"><persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> and the fortifications around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We opine that having done so in a measure they will have rather a lively time in getting out of the position they have thus chosen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> It is not proper for us to publish any facts concerning the movements of the vast Union army now in the enemy's rear, already made, to punish his temerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>We, however, know them to be such as to incline us to believe that a very few days will see the end of rebels in arms in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> We may add, not improperly, we fear, that not only are the fortifications around this city so garrisoned, equipped and prepared as to enable them successfully to withstand any attack that such an army as that of the rebels might make upon them, but that there is also a large reserved force of disciplined, veteran troops, in such a position with reference to them as to make the assurance of their security doubly sure, even without the certain cooperation of the large Union force lately upon the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> From the facts concerning the movements and positions of the rebels we narrate above, it is evident that their purpose is either to put <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> between themselves and <orgName n="army"><persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and while essaying to prevent (with a comparatively small force) the latter from crossing it, to assail us in and about our fortifications; or else to attempt to cross over into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, marching via <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><measure n="24hours" type="date">Twenty-four hours</measure>, at furthest, will surely solve this problem of their present aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It matters not which scheme the rebels have in view, as either must inevitably fail, met as it will be by our <num value="2">two</num> united great armies, and the troops in the fortifications immediately surrounding this city. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It is manifest that what the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations want is an end of that war as speedy, and leaving the industrial system of this country as little disorganized as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It would seem impossible for any considerate person to doubt that this is the very consummation which the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must want even more than it can be desired by the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>A new campaign is even beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>In order to determine whether it is likely to reach the desired end, it will not be unprofitable to consider the causes of its prolongation to the present period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>This Government at the beginning assumed, and it has constantly insisted, that the <rs>Union</rs> could, must and should be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>On the other hand, the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations, when they saw the storm burst upon the country, either doubted or actually disbelieved the possibility of that great salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> had but a subordinate and indirect interest in the great problem, and it supposed that if the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could be only convinced that the <rs>Union</rs> could not in the end be preserved, they would at once forego the contest and consent to a national dissolution, which it was erroneously thought would be followed by peace, while we know that it would only be the beginning of endless war. Thus, <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> opinion has practically favored the insurgents and encouraged them with ephemeral sympathies and unreal expectations of foreign intervention, and has thus protracted the war to the present time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> Certainly this Government and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people are even more confident of the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> now than they were a year ago, and are, therefore, even less likely now than they were then to accept peace, with the inconceivable pains and perils of dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Can it be presumptuous, then, for us to ask <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> statesmen to review, in the light of the events of the war, the opinion which they formed at so early a stage of it, that the opinion itself might, perhaps, properly be deemed a prejudice? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The only argument opposed to them is that the insurgents have determined not to acknowledge the authority of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The evidence of this is a certain resolute and defiant tone maintained by their organ. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> Certainly, so long as the insurgents have any hope of ultimate success they could not be expected to discourse otherwise than in just such a tone, nor will they fail to cherish such a hope, so long as they find a willingness to meet it with sympathy in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> But it must be remembered that the insurgents are men, and that they may reasonably be expected to speak and to act like other belligerent factions under similar conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>So, also, being men, and subject to the laws which determine the economy of society, they must in all cases conform themselves, however unwilling, to the circumstances by which they are surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>They cannot, more than other masses of men, determine for themselves under <num value="1">one</num> state of circumstances what they will do under a different <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> A writer upon war advises brave men never to nail their colors to the staff, remarking that if they shall be able, and find it desirable, they can maintain it there without nailing, while it will be more convenient to lower it if they shall find themselves unable or no longer desirous to keep it flying.--But, speaking practically, what has been the result thus far in the present case ?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The disunionist, even in their strongest holds, are not a people, but only a faction, surpassing the loyal in numbers, and silencing them by terrors and severities in many places; but, nevertheless, too few and feeble to prevent the return of any district or any State to the <rs>Union</rs>, in the presence and under the protection of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> I am aware that in regard to this point I am opening a subject which was early interdicted in this correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The reason for the interdiction, and the reason for a departure from it, are, however, equally obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It was properly left out of view, so long as might be reasonably hoped that by the practice of magnanimity this Government might cover that weakness of the insurgents, without encouraging them to persevere in their treasonable conspiracy against the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They have protracted the war a year, notwithstanding this forbearance of the <rs>Government</rs>, and yet they persist in invoking foreign arms to end a domestic strife, while they have forced slavery into such prominence that it cannot be overlooked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> He argues that the advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies is certain death to slavery, and that a servile war must commence sooner or later; that the stampede of negroes from the <q>&#x0022;disloyal&#x0022;</q> States is becoming very great, and that the <q>&#x0022;rebels&#x0022;</q> are thus daily weakened in their capacity to raise provisions for the continuance of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>He concludes as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> Let us now suppose that any <num value="1">one</num> or more <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> States should think it right or expedient to intervene by force to oblige the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to accept a compromise of their sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>What other effect could it produce than to render inevitable, and even hurry on, that servile war, so completely destructive of all <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> interests in this country, which this Government so studiously strives to avoid?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>I know that the danger of any foreign nation attempting such a policy if it has over existed, has passed, as I am happy in knowing that no foreign Government has over threatened such intervention, while several magnanimous Governments have repudiated all unfriendly designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>I have put forward that hypothesis only by way of preface to a question not less significant &mdash; namely, what must be the effect of such a policy abroad as will encourage the insurgents with hopes of an intervention which is never to occur?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Is not that effect visible in the obstinacy of the insurgents, in their destruction of the cotton and tobacco already cultivated and liable to be brought into commerce by the return of peace, and in their studied neglect of the planting the seed of their staples, and turning so much of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> labor as they are able to save to the production of supplies of provision and forage to enable them to continue the war? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> The effect will be further developed as time goes on, in opening a way for that servile war which, if it shall be permitted to come, will produced infinite suffering throughout the world, and can only at last result in an entirely new system of trade and commerce between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and all foreign nations. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>In a few weeks he will have <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> fresh troops in the field, in addition to those he already has. Even if our present force were able to contend alone with this enormous host, it is not just to them that they should be left to do so. They must be reinforced &mdash; very largely reinforced; and it is the duty of Congress to see that they be so. The importance of this duty cannot be overrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>It is paramount, for the moment, to every other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It is scarcely less important that it should be done now &mdash; instantly &mdash; before anything else be even thought of. We must have a reserve &mdash; a very large reserve &mdash; and it must immediately be put in training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>This is necessary, let our determination be what it may. If we resolve to advance, it is necessary to give us the power of sustaining the aggressive movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>If we determine to halt, it is necessary to enable us to repel the onward movements of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We entreat the members of Congress to turn their attention entirely to this object for a season, and not to withdraw it until they shall have completed a conscription law.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/> <hi rend="italics">Sir:</hi> There are times and circumstances when not to speak out is to sacrifice cardinal principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>We are now in just such times, and surrounded by just such circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>If you will recur to the brief interview between us in the <rs type="place">Hall</rs> last week, you will readily perceive, and, I am sure, generously appreciate, my motive in addressing you this note through the press. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/> As legal adviser and retained counsel for very many of our non script soldiers, I had the honor to present a petition for them to Congress, on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of its present session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>That petition was referred to the committee of which you are the chairman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>No report or action, so far as the proceedings of the <rs type="place">House</rs> inform me, has been made or had. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> The duties of counsel are not less imperious or sacred than those of representative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>In this capacity I now address you, because of the silence of your committee as to the petition and its action, through you, as its honored chairman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>on the report you made to Congress on yesterday. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> It is proper to say--<hi rend="italics">in limine</hi>--that I address you, sir, simply because you are the chairman of the committee to which the petition of my clients has been referred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>I will add, however, that it is a source of high satisfaction to me &mdash; individually and professionally &mdash; to know that I am addressing a statesman from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>,</hi> the resting place of the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Rutledge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00260" reg="mostcommon:Rutledge,nomatch:0"><surname>Rutledge</surname></persName>, Lownesses, Calmouns,</hi> of other and better days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Not only this &mdash; that <hi rend="italics">your</hi> State is as renowned for the manly chivalry and bold action of its public men, as <hi rend="italics">they</hi> are distinguished for their high sense of personal honor, devotion to States'-Rights, and invincible resistance to executive encroachments on the true theory of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> government and constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>This, sir, is no idle, passing compliment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It springs from the heart and is embalmed in the <hi rend="italics">historic annals of your State.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> There were certain grave constitutional questions presented in the petition of my clients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>They were not mere idle vagaries or theoretic problems; but stern, practical <hi rend="italics">living issues,</hi> connected with the vital organic action of the fundamental principle of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>They touch the <hi rend="italics">main spring</hi> of our governmental structure; they lie embedded in the essential materials which constitute the jewel of constitutional liberty; without their practical operation and mandatory development, our new experiment will be but a semblance and a cheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>I, then, respectfully ask &mdash; will your committee pass them, unheeded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>will they <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> a new bill, based on the negation of so vital a principle, and frame a new law in itself <hi rend="italics">impracticable,</hi> unless the original Conscript act is, in letter, spirit, and purport, violated! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> The bill which your committee has reported, proposes to extend the <name>Conscript</name> act to all over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> and under <measure n="45years" type="date">45 years</measure> of age. The act of <date value="04-16">16th April,</date><hi rend="italics">releases</hi> all over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> of age. <hi rend="italics">This is a fact which is fully admitted by the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary of War">Honorable Secretary of War</rs>, in his letter of the <date value="05-20">20th of May</date> to the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Is</hi> <num value="3">three</num> A Member of your Committee, or the <hi rend="smallcaps">House,</hi> who will Deny the fact in his Seat! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> But perhaps it may be considered in bad taste for <hi rend="italics">us</hi> to discuss <hi rend="italics">that bill.</hi> It certainly would be, except so far and to the extent to which it proposes to curtail the vested rights of my <hi rend="italics">clients,</hi> accrued and accruing, under the <hi rend="italics">original bill.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/> <num value="1">One</num> word on this point, and for the present I will dismiss the subject, and turn it over to your enlightened wisdom and experienced sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>If I rightly comprehend the <hi rend="italics">terms</hi> of the bill which you have reported, it empowers the <rs>President</rs>, as Chief Executive of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, to <hi rend="italics">conscript</hi> all men over <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> and under <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure> in all the <name>States</name> if those States do not answer the call made on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> I am aware that the opinion which I gave on the <rs>Conscript Act</rs>, and the petition which I have presented, have subjected me to much and serious an-inmedversion in certain quarters.
