<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>You can hear them specially the refugees from this section, laughing, and <unclear></unclear> to each other a cross the street, and see them shaking hands at every street corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>As the facts were immediately telegraphed to <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName>, and, see more <hi rend="italics">authentic</hi> details were to be had, I deferred writing you till I should get nearer the scene of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Whereupon the old, creature, who had never before wished to <unclear></unclear>, became oppressed with a sense of imprisonment, and, actually died in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought was, what a pity to destroy such substantial bridges, when the ford is so good, but we were emended that the water was high when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were along, and were assured by intelligent men that most probably the burning of the bridges here was all that kept the enemy from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Moreover, we were assured with reference to the many small bridges burnt on the road, that, besides their destruction being a military necessity, it saved, by the detention of the enemy, more than would rebuild them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The citizens say that the rout was perfect and that the enemy's cavalry fled disgracefully, pursued by numbers smaller than their own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The discussion of this and similar bills, it says, and the foolish proclamations of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, have revived the sinking cause of the rebels, and brought them back in triumph to the vicinity of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>So far as I know no attack was contemplated, and for some hours no enemy appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Many of the men strayed unrebuked through the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> camps, helping themselves, others scattered in the abattis, lately the scene of such terrible conflict, bringing in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who concealed themselves there when their comrades were beaten off. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> On there men, thus scattered, a heavy but harmless fire was opened with musketry by the enemy, from the woods some <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> to our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The men immediately ran to their colors, and the whole line advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>A very prevalent impression existed along the line at the time that we had friends in front who had advanced and drawn the enemy's fire. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>They were immediately greeted with a tremendous and most destructive fire at very short range from a concealed foe. Some confusion resulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>These brigades fell back to the point from which they started to re-form, which they subsequently did in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It halted to hold its position and protect its own flanks, until the continuity of the line was restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>And just there the <unclear>re-</unclear> and only fight worthy the name was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Over and again this brave brigade struck at the overpowering foe, right, left, and front, with the bayonet.--Every time, the enemy broke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>And thus it preserved its ground for hours, never yielding an inch until <persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Mahone,nomatch:0"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s and part of <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Colston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Colston,nomatch:0"><surname>Colston</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName> came up to cover its flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>By the time this was done &mdash; and it was well and gallantly done, without much fighting &mdash; the battle was over, the enemy whipped and silent.
