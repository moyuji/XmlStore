<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>We must then give him battle <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, or compel him to retire before us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> Should he retire on <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> (as the newspapers say he is now doing) we will be advancing towards <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>; but should he venture on <placeName reg="Florence, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,7013767">Florence</placeName> or <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName> to unite his forces with <persName n="Resecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Resecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Resecrans</surname></persName> or <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, we will have to concentrate enough of our forces from <rs type="direction">Middle</rs> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> to follow him rapidly and defeat him in a great battle, when we would be able to resume our march as before indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>We must, however, as soon as practicable, construct strong works to command the <placeName reg="Tennessee River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2715022">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Poor Fork Cumberland River, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,2592540">Cumberland rivers</placeName>, for otherwise our communication would be cut off by the enemy as soon as these <num value="2">two</num> rivers shall have risen sufficiently to admit the entrance of their gunboats and transports. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> The best positions for said works are about <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> below <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Forts Donelson</placeName></placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName>, not far from Eddysville, where those <num value="2">two</num> rivers come within <measure n="1.5miles" type="distance">one and a half miles</measure> of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I am informed there is at that point a commanding elevation, where a strong field work could be constructed for a garrison of about <num value="2500">twenty five hundred</num> or <num value="3">three</num> <sic>throusand</sic> men, when could hold out (with ample provisions and ammunition) against a large <sic>armay.</sic> Under the guns of this work and along the bank of each river a series of batteries armed with the heaviest guns (<num value="8">eight</num>, <num value="9">nine</num>, <measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure> and rifled guns) could be constructed, bearing directly on obstructions placed in each of said rivers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> When <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> shall have fallen into our possession I would construct a work there for the command of the <rs>Ohio</rs> and the canal, and I would destroy the latter as soon as possible, so completely that future travelers would hardly know where it was. This I would do as a return for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vandalism in attempting to obstruct forever the harbors of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>A detachment of our army could, I think, take <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, while the main body would be marching to <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>; but if we could get boats enough it would be shorter to go up the <rs>Ohio</rs> in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>To keep the command of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> would construct a strong work, heavily armed, at <placeName reg="Covington, Kenton, Kentucky" key="tgn,7014762">Covington</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It is evident the forces at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Yazoo River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2784619">Yazoo river</placeName> would then have their line of communication by the river with the <rs>North</rs> cut off, and they would have either to surrender or cross without resources into <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, where <persName n="Holmes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> would take good care of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>From <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> I would compel the forces at <placeName reg="Corinth, Sumner, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098632">Corinth</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson, Tenn.</placeName>, to fall back precipitately to <persName n="Humboldt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Humboldt,nomatch:0"><surname>Humboldt</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, or their lines of communication would be cut off also.

<head>The Northern elections.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> The elections thus far seem to have gone largely in favor of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Both <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> have returned a majority of Democratic representatives to Congress, and persons well acquainted with New York politics believe that the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> will give a majority of <num value="40000">40,000</num> for the <rs>Democratic</rs> ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>In the meantime, however, <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName>, who but the other day published an article in which he foreshadowed curses that have fallen on no city since the fall of <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName> as destined to fall upon New York in the event of <persName n="Wadsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="mostcommon:Wadsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wadsworth</surname></persName>'s election, has faced to the right about and shouts vehemently for that very <persName n="Wadsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="mostcommon:Wadsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wadsworth</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Perhaps he may have received orders from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00253" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> &mdash; perhaps he may have been bribed, as some of our contemporaries conjecture &mdash; but the most probable surmise is that he sees something in the atmosphere which indicates the certain election of his new favorite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> It can make very little difference with us, we imagine, whether the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> or the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> triumph in these elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Neither of them is a peace party, so far as we are able to see, and both of them propose to carry on the war with all the powers of the <rs>Government</rs>, legitimate or usurped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>With regard to the <hi rend="italics">manner</hi> of conducting it there is, it is true, a difference of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The Abolitionists seek our subjugation by emancipating the slaves and arming them to fight against us.--The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> profess to leave property as it now is. This difference, however, is theoretical merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00254" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is a wide-mouthed declaimer against the <name>Abolitionists</name>, yet he has done more injury to Southern slaveholders than all the <name>Beechers</name> and all the <name>Garrisons</name> that ever preached a crusade of murder against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>From <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, he has lent himself, heart and soul, to the projects of the <name>Abolitionists</name>, and whether he be <num value="1">one</num> in theory it matters very little to the <rs>South</rs>, seeing what his practice has been. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> The <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> have more sense than the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>They see the absurdity of attempting to subjugate the <rs>South</rs> by liberating the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They see that by doing so they destroy the productiveness of the <rs>South</rs>, and by means of Southern products only can they hope to pay off their debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It is probable, therefore, that they might propose a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, with certain pledges, guarantees, &#x0026;c. To this the <rs>South</rs> will never consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They will never exist in the same political association be its name what it may, be its terms what they will, and be the guarantees whatever the good will of the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> may make them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>They want nothing more to do with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and they are determined to have nothing more to do with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Let them pay off their own debt with their own resources; we have as much as we can do to pay off ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We cannot consent to return to the state of vassalage from which we have emerged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We cannot consent to sit in a Congress in which nothing is debated but the <hi rend="italics">nigger</hi> from the beginning of the longest session to the end of it. We can never again affiliate with people who made a martyr of the cold-blooded assassin, <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, and thought he was doing a glorious deed when he was dying his hands in the blood of our people.--We of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> made up our minds to endure the worst extremity to which war can reduce a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>We are prepared for it. The Government that should propose to reunite us with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> could not exist a day. It would sink so deep beneath the deluge of popular indignation that even history would not be able to fish up the wreck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> It can make no difference to us, then, what party prevails in the coming elections in the <rs>North</rs>.--Neither is likely to propose anything that the <rs>South</rs> will accept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Both will conduct the war on the same principle, as we may learn from the example of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>We must look to ourselves and not to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Even <persName n="Buren,Mister,John,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="expanded:Buren,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName> cannot think of letting us go without inflicting a deep humiliation on us.
