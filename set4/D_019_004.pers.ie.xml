<head>Letter from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> An interesting letter in the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore American</orgName>, from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, gives an inside view of the official business of the new &#x0022;Republic&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> At the <rs>Governor</rs>'s quarters I found the greatest activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The room was filled with aids writing out orders and dispatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The various <rs>Secretaries</rs> of His <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Military-Chief">Military Chief</rs> of the <rs>Republic</rs>, were all employed in attending to the demands made upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The Governor himself was seated upon a rostrum facing the entrance, surrounded by half a score or more of gentlemen in military undress or in citizens' habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>All seemed impressed with anxiety and concern, and from what I saw going on, and from what I heard, I inferred that the <rs>State</rs> considered herself in an actual state of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The messengers that ran hither and thither bore military looking dispatches, with great seals upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The Governor appeared careworn, but determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He expressed himself to those about him as engaged in preparation for the worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He listened to the suggestions of his advisers, and read the reports of military subordinates as soon as they reached his hand, and on the instant issued such directions as seemed to be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The measures he has already taken for defence are principally confined to the harbor, beyond <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.--This post is not generally known to be almost in the middle of <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, half-way between <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Three Trees, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096824">Fort Johnson</placeName>. <placeName reg="Three Trees, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096824">Fort Johnson</placeName> is no stronghold in any sense, but merely the sight of an old revolutionary work, on which entrenchments are now being thrown up, and batteries are being erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName> is also the site for another work undergoing construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Both the localities bear directly upon <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and, besides, command all vessels that enter the harbor on the <num value="1">one</num> side, while opposite positions command the rest of the entrance to the bar, so that before any craft or vessel-of-war is able to reach <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, she will have to encounter the breastworks, batteries, &#x0026;c., erected on the outside. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> To the left of the <name>Gubernatorial</name> quarters is a chamber occupied by a number of staff officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These gentlemen were in the midst of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A long green baize table extended nearly from end to end of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was literally covered with papers, while the floor of the room was in an equally unfortunate condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There was no lounging on the part of any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The men all looked to be thoroughly immersed in business; many of them were busy writing out orders, which were promptly delivered to men in waiting; none were idle, and affairs of the greatest moment appeared to occupy every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The Governor is quite up to the mark of promptness which the order of the people demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>All under him are bound to be active, and all that liveliness can accomplish will be done, you may rest assured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> I should give you some description of the <rs>Governor</rs>'s apartment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story of the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName>, the seat of municipal and magisterial justice, corner of <address><street n="Broad Street">Broad</street></address> and <address><street n="Meeting Street">Meeting</street></address> streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The <rs type="place">Recorder's Court</rs>-room is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> you enter on the story above the basement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Passing through this you ascend to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story by a broad and winding staircase of mahogany until you are brought up in front of the <rs>Mayor</rs>'s office, which of itself is a most luxuriously furnished apartment, being fitted up with heavy red damask curtains, mirrors, gilded frames, marble mantles, richly papered walls, heavy velvet chairs, luxurious sofas and rich <placeName key="tgn,2200703" n="1.000 10" reg="Brussells, Lincoln, Missouri">Brussells</placeName> carpets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Adjoining this retreat of official dignity is the <rs type="place">Executive Chamber</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>A placard on the door-post given information of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>You pass the vigilance of a sentinel and brush through a crowd of military men in attendance, and are ushered into the <rs>Executive</rs> presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing that strikes the eye is a dais or rostrum, in appearance something like the reading desk of a church, only it is covered with dark red velvet and bestrewn with papers, inkstands and pens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Private-Secretary">Private Secretary</rs> of the <rs>Governor</rs> occupied it when I was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> admitted into the apartment and he was as busy as all the rest, writing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Above this desk is a bust of <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, and leaning against the wall below it is a dozen or more of long, black ebony rods, with old heads, which I am told are used on State occasions by high functionaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They are chiefly carried in the hand when processions are moving, and belong, I believe, to the <rs>Aldermen</rs> and <rs>Mayor</rs> of the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The entire room is richly furnished, and is of large dimensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>At this time it was in much confusion, owing to the great amount of business transacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>All around the walls rich pictures, portraits, busts, &#x0026;c., were suspended, giving an air of refinement to the apartment in perfect keeping with its other appointments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> In front of the dais, and indeed scattered all over the room, were writing tables, with clerks and aids at work &mdash; giving the whole place exactly the appearance of a drawing-room suddenly transferred into an editor's or reporter's quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>About the grand old fireplace a knot of military officers were gathered in conversation; among these the <rs>Governor</rs> freely circulated, and seemed anxious to participate in what was going on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Since the affair of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, our military ardor has been up to the highest pitch &mdash; each day has brought into existence new companies, and by degrees the city assumes a thoroughly warlike appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Military uniforms, of the homeliest character, swarm the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>None but Southern-made <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs> are worn, except perhaps the cloth of a finer texture I noticed on some of the soldiers, which, they tell me, is imported from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> direct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> We have had rumors that the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Harriet Lane</rs> had been dispatched, or is about being dispatched, with reinforcements for <persName n="Anderson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Mary,Jane,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The Governor is determined to intercept her at <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> below the fort, where earthworks are being erected, composed of <placeName key="tgn,2020752" n="1.000 1" reg="palmetto, manatee, florida">Palmetto</placeName> logs and sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Similar earthworks are being erected on the other side of the channel, at the lower end of <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName>, so that she will have to pass through a raking fire, and it is believed that she will be sunk before she can reach the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The Citadel Cadets have their battery on <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName>, and have charge of the defences at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The Vigilant Rifles are stationed on <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, near the <rs type="place">Light House</rs>, and their guns have full command of the ship channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The <orgName n="Zouaves company" type="company">company of Zouaves</orgName> have been stationed at another point with a powerful battery, near the mouth of the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Every defencible point of the harbor is in possession of armed men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> No definite movement has yet been made for an attack on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, though rumors are abundant in relation to some movement in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The rumor on the street is that it is to be starved out and then stormed by large parties of men on rafts, protected by the batteries from the shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Mary,Jane,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, however, is undoubtedly beleaguered, but is believed to be in possession of abundant supplies, and should the fortress be attacked he can hold out long enough to receive succor, if it is the intention of the <rs>Government</rs> to make any movement in that direction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The number of arms in the <orgName n="U. S. Arsenal" type="org">United States Arsenal</orgName>, which is now in full possession of the <rs>State</rs>, has been greatly exaggerated.--They do not exceed <num value="25000">25,000</num> stand, instead of <num value="70000">70,000</num>, and many of them old flint locks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The city is nightly patrolled by the military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Though there is no fear of the negroes or any enemies within the city, it is thought necessary to drill the new recruits in all the stern realities of the soldier's life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Preparations are making to fortify some of the points of the harbor with cotton bales, covered with a foot of earth, so as to prevent their conflagration from hot shot that may be used from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>. <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">Chevauz de frise</hi></foreign> and other obstructions are being devised to drop in the channel to prevent any vessels-of-war from coming in. All the buoys in the channel are being removed, and the lights on the coast will be extinguished so soon as it is ascertained that any naval vessel is approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The coast is the most dangerous in the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> The military on the coast, unused as they are to such exposure and hardships, are suffering greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The weather has been quite cold, as well as damp and disagreeable, and their relatives in the city are in great distress about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The realities of practical secession are already found to be much more serious than was anticipated, although the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun has not been fired yet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> I learn to-day that the <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post-Office Department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> has refused to all an order of the <rs type="place">City</rs> Postmaster for <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> worth of stamps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It is supposed that cash in advance will be demanded for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>This is awkward, and difficult to remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>All the fire companies have donned military uniforms, and are drilling in prospect of being called into active service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> It is now reported that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Mary,Jane,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was scared out of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> by <num value="3">three</num> rockets let off at the eastern and of <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName>, and that he left in great haste, thinking it was a signal for attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This is not so, however, though it is certain he did not take much time in transferring his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>This is evidenced by the condition of the quarters of the officers &mdash; such as hats, <unclear></unclear> cents, <unclear></unclear> opened, with books on the floor, and stool overturned. </p> </div4> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> In his message to the <rs>Pennsylvania Legislature</rs>, <persName n="Packer,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Packer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Packer</surname></persName>, after discussing the <rs>Personal Liberty</rs> law of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, makes the following suggestions: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> While a majority of the <rs>Judges</rs> of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, in the <name>Prigg</name> case, held that a State had no constitutional right to provide by legislation for delivering up fugitives from labor, a minority were then of the opinion that State laws, consistent with and in aid of the constitutional injunction, were valid and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>And this minority opinion is now the judgment of the present Court, as recently indicated in a case which arose in the <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">State of Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>There is, therefore, nothing to prevent the revival of the act of <dateStruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></dateStruct> and its restoration to the place in our code to which by its merits it is so justly entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>This would leave to the option of the claimant whether he would seek his remedy under State or National laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He had this right before the repeal of our act of <dateStruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></dateStruct>, and, in my opinion, no good reason can be assigned for refusing to place him again in the same position. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> I would also recommend that the consent of the <rs>State</rs> be given that the master, while sojourning in our State, for a limited period, or passing through it, may be accompanied by his slave, without losing his right to his services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>While such legislation is due to the comity which should ever exist between the different States of this Union, it would undoubtedly tend greatly to restore that peace and harmony which are now so unwisely perilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>By it <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> would concede no principle &mdash; we would be simply falling back upon our ancient policy, adopted at a time when our people were themselves struggling for their rights, and never departed from, until, by a misconception of its meaning, <num value="1">one</num> of our most important statutes was declared unconstitutional. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> From <dateStruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, a period of <measure n="67years" type="date">sixty-seven years</measure>, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, herself a free State, permitted the citizens of other States to sojourn within her limits, with their slaves, for any period not exceeding <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, and to pass through the <rs>State</rs>, in traveling from <num value="1">one</num> State to another, free from all molestation.--Was she injured, or was the cause of human freedom retarded by the friendly grant of this privilege?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>This question cannot be truthfully answered in the affirmative; but it may be safely averred, that by changing our policy in this respect, we have, in some degree, at least, alienated from us the feelings of fraternal kindness which bound together so closely the sisterhood of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Let us, then, renew this pledge of amity and friendship, and once more extend a kindly welcome to the citizens of our common country, whether visiting us on business or pleasure, not withstanding they may be accompanied by those who, under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws, are held to service and labor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> In relation to a settlement of the <rs>National</rs> troubles, the <rs>Governor</rs> says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> May we not wisely follow the example of our fathers, by re-enacting the old <placeName reg="Compromise line">Compromise line</placeName> of <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, and extending it to the boundary of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Not by the means of legislation of doubtful constitutionality, but by an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, and thus permanently fix the condition of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, so that those who desire to occupy them may find a home, at their discretion, either where slavery is tolerated or where it is prohibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>If the adoption of such an amendment would peacefully settle the difficulties around us, I am satisfied that it would be sanctioned by the people of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>At all events they should have an opportunity to accept or reject it, if made as a peace-offering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>I would, therefore, recommend the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> to instruct and request our <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Representatives in Congress to support a proposition for such an amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to be submitted for ratification or rejection to a <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">Convention of delegates</orgName>, elected directly by the people of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> </q><bibl n="Governor"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> In the event of the failure of Congress speedily to propose this, or a similar amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the citizens of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> should have all opportunity, by the application of some peaceable remedy, to prevent the dismemberment of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>This can only be done by calling a <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">Convention of delegates</orgName> to be elected by the people, with a view solely to the consideration of what measures should be taken to meet the present fearful exigencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>If Congress should propose no remedy, let it emanate from the source of all authority, the people themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> Every attempt upon the part of individuals, or of organized societies, to lead the people away from their allegiance to the <rs>Government</rs>, to induce them to violate any of the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or to incite insurrections in any of the <name>States</name> of this Union, ought to be prohibited by law, as crimes of a treasonable nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It is of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance to the perpetuity of this <orgName n="Great Union" type="union">great Union</orgName> that the hearts of the people, and the action of their constituted authorities, should be in unison in giving a faithful support to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The people of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> are devoted to the <rs>Union</rs>.--They will follow its stars and its stripes through every peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>But, before assuming the high responsibilities now dimly foreshadowed, it is their solemn duty to remove every just cause of complaint against themselves, so that they may stand before high heaven, and the civilized world, without fear and without reproach, ready to devote their lives and their fortunes to the support of the best form of government that has ever been devised by the wisdom of man. </p> </div4>

<head>Message of the <rs>Governor</rs> of New York.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> After referring to State affairs, <persName n="Morgan,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,Edwin,D.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s message to the <orgName n="New York Legislature" type="legislature">New York Legislature</orgName> touches on Federal relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It opposes the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> is held up as the root from which sprung all our present evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The message concludes thus: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> Not desiring the adoption of the <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 4898" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> line, in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, and opposing, with almost solid front, the weight of her influence to the repeal in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, this State does not ask, nor does she desire, the restoration of that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>After full and free discussion, her people have declared against the extension of slavery into any of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and this they regard as a disposition of that question until revoked by the same authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Ever ready, nevertheless, as she has proved herself heretofore, New York will, in all honorable ways, endeavor to reconcile the estrangements now existing in the country. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> A magnanimous and loyal State, in such an exigency, may well forego the question whether assumed grievances are real or only imaginary; but while her action should be marked by patience, calmness, conciliation and fraternal affection, there should be no surrender of important rights, nor sacrifice of vital principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>It is equally clear she should not insist on points of pride, or on more abstraction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> Though brought forward under misapprehension, <num value="1">one</num> such grievance is alleged against this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>In <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, conformably to the general opinion of that day, the <name>Legislature</name> passed a statute granting a trial by jury, in the <rs>Courts</rs> of this State, to persons charged as being fugitives from service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Afterwards, the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, in the case of Prigg against the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, decided that all State laws, even though subordinate to the <rs>Federal</rs> enactments, and favorable to the extradition of fugitives, were inconsistent with the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and therefore void; and so this statute of our State, which granted a trial by jury, became ineffective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>It has been universally held to be obsolete by all our commentators, and all our public authorities, although now improperly classed among what are technically called &#x0022;Personal Liberty laws,&#x0022; and made occasion for exciting jealousies and discontents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>I therefore recommend its repeal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> In this connection, and while disavowing any disposition to interfere with that which exclusively pertains to the individual States, and in a spirit of fraternal kindness, I would respectfully invite all those States which have upon their statute books any laws of this character, conflicting with the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, to repeal them at the earliest opportunity; not upon condition that a more equitable fugitive slave law be passed, nor upon any other conditions, but relying for the proper modifications of this enactment upon the justice and wisdom of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Let the free States fulfill all the obligations of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and laws, then, with propriety, they may exact like obedience from all the other States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> That the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President elect">Vice President elect</rs>, though constitutionally chosen, were unacceptable to a portion of the <rs>South</rs>, was the cause <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> avowed for succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>This ground, however, proving untenable as soon as assumed, the agitators fell back upon other alleged grievances and renewed their complaints with a view to <unclear></unclear> and alarm the people of those States with idle and painful fears. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> Every <num value="1">one</num> knows, or may know, that the newly-elected <rs type="role2">President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>, not only can have no motive nor desire to do any injury to the complaining States, but that they will have no power to exercise for such a purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> The <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName> is now controlled by the same political majority which has controlled it for the <num value="2">two</num> last Presidential terms; the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, already chosen for half the term for which the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> are elected are of the same majority as the <name>Senate</name>; and the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> is pressingly the same as it has been for nearly <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century, and all the constitutional guarantees are in force now as here <unclear></unclear>, against Executive <unclear></unclear>. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> While the question of slavery, throughout all history, has been a subject of debate, the record of the past will show that the people of the free States have remained content with the disposition of the subject made by the <rs>Constitution</rs> and Federal laws, and have refrained from any political agitation of it until attempts were persistently made to extend the institution into the national domain, with a view, as we have seen, to increase the number of the slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The alternative was now forced upon the <rs>Northern States</rs>, either of a ceaseless agitation of the subject of slavery, with a view to its removal even from the slaveholding States themselves, or else of resisting its introduction into the public domain through the intervention of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>They chose the latter, and have on all occasions proclaimed, and in the most solemn manner pledged, to the slave States, the entire, absolute, and unquestioned control, regulation, management and disposition of slavery within their own borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>This is the position of the free States to-day, as it always has been, and the convictions and sentiment of the whole people, save those of a mere fraction, are in harmony with it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> Angered by private griefs, or what they have deemed an unjust fugitive slave act, a few inconsiderate persons of the <rs>Northern States</rs> have made either actual or seeming aggressions upon the rights of the people of the slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>This, of course, has been met by the people of the latter in a temper and spirit hostile and retaliatory, as might have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Vindictive laws have been passed by them, peaceable and unoffending citizens of Northern birth have been degraded or banished by Southern communities and authorities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> What is especially wanted, both at the <rs>North</rs> and at the <rs>South</rs>, is not only a cessation of hostile words and acts, but a complete restoration of all those amicable and fraternal relations which formerly existed in every portion of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and without which the <rs>Union</rs> ceases to confer its highest advantages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> No apprehension, however, need be entertained that the people of this law-abiding State would, in any case, suffer their authorities or agents in the <rs>State</rs> or Federal Government to invade or impair any constitutional right or privilege of the slave States; on the contrary, they stand always as ready to guarantee those rights as to defend their own, and I think it would be well for the <name>Legislature</name> to give such new and solemn utterances to these convictions as shall afford to the people of all the <rs>Southern States</rs> the assurance that all their rights, under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws, are recognized, and will, on the part or the people of this State, be respected and maintained inviolate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> I fully believe that if justice and moderation shall mark the conduct of the loyal States, we shall safely pass the present crisis, as we have passed many others, without loss of substantial rights or self-respect; for I am unwilling to admit that there are madmen, either at the <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, sufficiently formidable in power or in numbers, to destroy the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName>; a Union which has been productive of inestimable good; a Union in which all sections and parts have contributed in diverse, though harmonious modes, to that common result of strength, stability and happiness, manifest to every eye, in every direction, throughout the length and breadth of this extended land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> In view, however, of the momentous questions involved, it becomes the solemn duty of the <rs>National Executive</rs> to act with promptitude and firmness; the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">National Legislature</orgName> with moderation and conciliation, and the public press, throughout the country, with that regard to the rights of all sections and interests which its vast influence and responsibilities demand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> Every State can do something, and ought to do all that it can to avert the threatened danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Let New York set the example in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Let her oppose no barrier; but, on the contrary, let her Representatives in the <orgName n="Federal Legislature" type="legislature">Federal Legislature</orgName> give their ready support to any settlement that shall be just and honorable to all &mdash; a settlement <num value="1">one</num> alike to the cherished memories of the past, the mighty interests of the present, and the myriads of the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> Let her stand in attitude of hostility to none; but extending the hand of fellowship to all, and living up to the strict letter of that great fundamental law, the living and immortal bond of the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName>, cordially unite with other members of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, in proclaiming and enforcing the determination that the <rs>Constitution</rs> shall be honored, and the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName> shall be preserved. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Morgan,,Edwin,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Morgan,Edwin,D.,,"><foreName>Edwin</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName>  <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, <date value="1861-01-01">Jan. 1, 1861.</date> </closer> </div4>
