<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> I observe in the <orgName n="Richmond Papers" type="newspaper">Richmond papers</orgName> that the credit of the cavalry charge made upon the enemy at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName> is given to the <orgName type="regiment" key="2VACav">2d Virginia cavalry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Now, while the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> is a gallant regiment, yet it is not entitled to the credit given it on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The charge was made by the <orgName type="regiment" key="6VACav">6th Virginia cavalry</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Flournoy,Lieutenant-Colonel,Thomas,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Flournoy,Thomas,S.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>After the enemy were driven from <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName> the cavalry were ordered in pursuit, the <orgName type="regiment" key="6Cav">6th cavalry</orgName> being in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><num value="4">Four</num> companies of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> overtook the enemy about <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName></placeName> on the turnpike leading to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The enemy, comprising <num value="3">three</num> companies of cavalry, <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery, and more than a regiment of infantry, had formed to receive the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> charged them, when their cavalry took to immediate flight; but their infantry, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> regiment made a determined stand, and the conflict for some time was fierce and bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We lost about <num value="25">twenty- five</num> in killed and wounded, the enemy about the same number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We took about <measure n="600" type="prisoners">six hundred prisoners</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> In killed, wounded, and prisoners, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> regiment was actually demolished, not more than <num value="15">fifteen</num> escaping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>After the rout was complete, and most of the prisoners captured, others came up and assisted in taking prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Owing to the difficulty in crossing the bridge at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName>, which had been set on fire by the enemy, it was difficult for the cavalry to cross the river, which accounts for so small a portion of the cavalry being in the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>There were but <num value="4">four</num> companies in the charge, which were--<orgName n="company"><persName n="Dulany,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dulany,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Dulany</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>, <persName n="Grimsley,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grimsley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Grimsley</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Flournoy,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Flournoy,Thomas,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Flournoy</surname></persName>'s, and the lamented <persName n="Baxter,Captain,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Baxter,George,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Baxter</surname></persName>'s. <num value="3">Three</num> other companies of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> came up in time to follow in the pursuit, viz: <orgName n="company"><persName n="Richards,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Richards,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Richards</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>.

The rout of the enemy was complete, and this charge of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> is considered <num value="1">one</num> of the best cavalry charges that has been made during the present war, and it is due the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> that it should have the credit of its own deeds.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Having noticed in several of the <orgName n="Richmond Papers" type="newspaper">Richmond papers</orgName> communications concerning the battles near this place of the <dateStruct value="--07"><day reg="7">7th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="--8"><day reg="8">8th instant</day></dateStruct>, and seeing that they are denominated the battles of Crose Keys and <placeName reg="Lewiston, Androscoggin, Maine" key="tgn,7013885">Lewiston</placeName>, I beg leave to call the attention of the public, through the medium of your widely circulated journal, to a few facts and events which will entitle this place to the honor of having been the theatre upon which was enacted those glorious achievements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>As you are pressed for space and prefer short communications to lengthy ones, I shall be as brief as possible, and without further preliminary remarks give my reasons for believing that the recent battles fought near this place should be entitled the <q>&#x0022;Battles of <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>.&#x0022; </q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> In the first place, <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s army had retreated to this place, the long trains of baggage wagons and prisoners had passed safely over the bridge, and the firing commenced immediately on the banks of the river opposite the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The enemy were driven back by degrees until they reached the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Union Church, Jefferson, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057675">Union Church</placeName>, where the hottest of the contest ensued, about <placeName><distance reg="2.5miles">two and a half miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName></placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> In the second place, the enemy's cavalry dashed into town, surrounded the house that they supposed was the headquarters of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and demanded his surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They were immediately fired upon and driven away faster than they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Many of the houses in town have bullet holes through them, and several of them had cannon balls and shells shot through them; and in several places the fences are completely riddled with grape and canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Also, many pieces of shell have been picked up in various parts of the town, all going to prove conclusively that those battles should be entitled the battles of <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>And it was at this point, too, that the enemy were aiming to cut off <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s retreat, and the battles having actually commenced immediately in, and were terminated in the immediate vicinity of the town, I am clearly of the opinion that this place should not be deprived of the historic glory which will be given to those important events. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> If you had a map of the locality, and could see the geographical position of the place, I am sure you would enter the list with me and contend that <placeName key="tgn,2113715" n="1.000 5" reg="port republic, rockingham, virginia">Port Republic</placeName> should certainly be entitled to the honor and glory of christening those battles; and I am sure you have not failed to observe that all of the <rs>Northern</rs> correspondents denominate them the battles of <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> Much more might be said on this subject, but as I have already said enough to convince a candid public of the justness of our claims to the coveted honor, I shall say no more for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>We make some extracts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> It must be kept in mind that, under the most favorable circumstances &mdash; the immediate repudiation of the blockade, supported by a competent naval force to sweep every blockading vessel from the <rs>Confederate</rs> coast &mdash; the supplies of cotton must still continue for many months to be scant and dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Nature has arranged for the <rs>Southern States</rs> a business season which man cannot invert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>As the staple matures, the rivers, without which cotton lands are of little value, begin to rise; and during the long harvesting of the crops &mdash; the so-called picking season &mdash; bale after bale, in small lots, so soon as ready for the market, are placed on board the fleet of steamers which swarm on every navigable water course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>At the same time the seaport cities become healthy, and admit of the immigration of a large white laboring class from the <rs>North</rs>, who are indispensable to the proper and prompt disposal of the crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Thus the picking, ginning, baling, transportation, and sale of the cotton are so nearly simultaneous that when the last bale is picked on the plantation, the business season in the seaport is already drawing to its close. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> Contrast with this the conditions under which the crop of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> is to be moved, should the ports be opened during the summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The rivers are low, and navigable only for boats of the lightest draught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Of such boats no new ones have been built for the trade, as is usual even in ordinary seasons; but a great many have been converted to warlike purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The cotton lies unpinned on the plantations, and though a bountiful supply of gunny bags and iron ties from this country may, in a measure, remove this difficulty, these supplies must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reach the planter are the cotton can be made ready for shipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Suppose all these obstacles removed, whence shall come the necessary labor at the seaport?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The class which always supplied it &mdash; even if it could endure the fatal summer heats, and the yellow fever, was banished from the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> coasts &mdash; now composes the bulk of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Will these be instantly disbanded, and if so, will the <rs>Confederates</rs> permit, without question, the same invasion which, in another form, they have poured out their life-blood to resist? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>I say we, courteously, for I am not included in the class of persons who are contumacious to dogs, horses, and other quadrupedal inhabitants of our planet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The fact is, I am more interested in a beaver than a beau; and a chained bear, who travels all his waking hours in a circle, and always turns a somersault at a particular point, is much more interesting to me than a fashionable young fellow doing very much the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> For instance, when I said to my little brother: <q>&#x0022;How came you to go into the china closet, and take mamma's oranges?&#x0022;</q> he answered, redolent of the purloined fruit, <q> &#x0022;O sister, how could you see me through the door, when it was locked?&#x0022;</q> and he went away convinced that I was something very like a witch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>You could not have followed me, unless you had been on the back of another <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName>; and, besides, you say that you have been here all the time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> <q>&#x0022;Simply and only,&#x0022;</q> I replied, <q>&#x0022;because I have a nose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>When you came in, I smelt <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName> and the penny-royal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The mingled odors told me that you had been brushing the flies off the horse with some springs of the herb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The next odor I smelt was the thyme, and then the wild roses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>When you came to this side of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>I smelt the verbena &mdash; the only perfume <persName n="Stacy,,Mary,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="default:Stacy,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Stacy</surname></persName> uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>When you came a little nearer, I smelt Turkish tobacco and the sizing of paper; and then I was sure you had some paper from <persName n="Stacy,,Luke,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="default:Stacy,Luke,,,"><foreName>Luke</foreName> <surname>Stacy</surname></persName>, and the most probable idea was, a letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> The gate was fastened by a pin, which was put in a hole bored in the gate-post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>When this pin was taken out the gate swung open, and if the wind were right, it might be closed again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> <q>&#x0022;He has more sense than a great many men,&#x0022;</q> I said, as I passed into the orchard, and when the crushed clover blossoms gave me notice that the horse had passed but a few minutes previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>I went to him and tried to unbuckle the bridal on the wrong side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>He quietly turned the other side of his head to my awkward hands, putting the right buckle pertinaciously before me, till I unfastened it.--<persName n="Cumming,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="default:Cumming,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Cumming</surname></persName> came along, greatly pleased, but said that <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName> should do the gate-trick again, that he might see him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>He drew out the gate-pin with his teeth, and when the gate was sprung open, he put the pin again in the hole, and went his way again to feast upon the sweet grass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> <q>&#x0022;Leave him to me,&#x0022;</q> said I; <q>&#x0022;I will take care of him.&#x0022;</q> When <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> was gone, and <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName> was satisfied with the grass, I called him by a low whistle that his master used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He trotted up to me, and laid his nose upon my shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>I led him to the door, and saddled him with my own side-saddle, and then, with very little preparation, I started for a contraband ride.--<persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName> cantered away seemingly proud of his burden, and I was rocking in the cradle of an ecstatic delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/><measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> fled, and I was in my <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>I always called him <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName>, and it never occurred, to me that our relations could be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>People asked why he did not marry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>He said that his old bachelorism was a chronic complaint, and would probably never be cured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> night as I lay in bed that the thought occurred to me. What if <persName n="Cumming,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="default:Cumming,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Cumming</surname></persName> should marry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It is surely no harm to speak of it now, for he has been married several years, and I--.But I will not anticipate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> The pretty widow, <persName n="Jameson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Jameson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs</roleName> <surname>Jameson</surname></persName>, had been staying a month with a friend in our neighborhood, and <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> had often been very polite to her, and, what was worse than all, he had promised that she should ride <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The next day was appointed for her to ride, and by a net very strange coincidence, I this night asked myself the question: <q>&#x0022;Why cannot I be married to <persName n="Cumming,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="default:Cumming,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Cumming</surname></persName>?&#x0022;</q> The answer was, he is old enough to be your father. </p> 
<p>

My pulse beat fast, and the long vista of my future life looked gloomy and terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>After tormenting myself till I thought I wanted to die, I fell asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>I awoke in a kind of shuddering horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>I had heard sounds the like of which I had never heard before; they seemed compounded of the squeal of a horse and the groans and cries of a human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>I was sure I had heard these sounds, that it was not a sleeping fancy; but when I was fully awake I heard them no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It was a warm night in the latter part of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, and my windows were raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>I slept on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> floor, and <num value="2">two</num> large windows of my room faced the south.--Half a mile in a direct line from these windows was a post road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>I was sure that the sounds I had heard came from the road, or its near vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>I listened earnestly, but all was still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Suddenly there floated into the room, filling it, as it were, with an odor that I was perfectly sure was from human blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>I shrank down into my bed, and shook with horror; then, with a great effort of my will, I arose, threw on a dressing gown, and hurried to my father's room. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> <q>&#x0022;Father, father!&#x0022;</q> I cried, <q>&#x0022;come with me.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> <q>&#x0022;What is it, <persName><foreName>Agnes</foreName></persName> dear?&#x0022;</q> said my mother.

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> I waited for my father to dress, and it seemed an hour's time, though only a few minutes, that he was putting on his clothes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> When we were out of hearing of my mother, I told him of the sounds and of the smell of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>He always believed me when I told him of anything that seemed incredible, for he had much experience of the truth of the testimony of my senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/><q>&#x0022;Father,&#x0022;</q> said I, <q> &#x0022;half a mile from here, close to the post road, a human being is lying, bleeding to death, I am sure of it&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> My father took a lantern and went to <persName n="Cumming,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="default:Cumming,William,,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <surname>Cumming</surname></persName>; I dressed, and when they came I led the way to the spot, where I was convinced we should find some <measure n="1" type="dead">one dead</measure> or dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The howling of the dog that preceded us struck us all with a sad solemnity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>As we drew near the edge of our field, which was bounded by the road, we saw a horse standing, and as we came nearer we saw it was <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Lying beside him was a man. My father stooped to examine, and said: <q>&#x0022;I believe he is dead.&#x0022;</q> The halter was buckled to his arm, and he was bitten horribly in his arms and legs, and had bled to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They raised him and laid him on the back of the now docile <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName>, thinking that perhaps he had only fainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They took him to our house, but he was quite dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>He proved to be the thief who had stolen <persName n="Selim,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Selim,nomatch:0"><surname>Selim</surname></persName> before, and who had only been <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> out of prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>After necessary formalities, the poor wretch was buried.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> I was very ill from the shock of this dreadful scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>I believe I was out of my senses, and had a sort of brain fever, which was very much aggravated when the <persName n="Jameson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:Jameson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">widow</roleName> <surname>Jameson</surname></persName> called to see me. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> <q>&#x0022;<persName><foreName>Agnes</foreName></persName>, dear,&#x0022;</q> he said, almost impatiently, <q>&#x0022;I wish you never would call me &#x0027;<persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName>&#x0027; again;&#x0022;</q> and his forehead had an ugly scowl on it, which greatly marred its exceeding beauty. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> <q>&#x0022;Please promise never to call me uncle again,&#x0022;</q> he said, beseechingly. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> We regret this Department has been the scene of various outrages within the past few days; and it would seem that the public peace is becoming as unstable as it was under the secession rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>We have had street rows, and various municipal disagreeable, calculated to create alarm for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>We find secessionism more defiant and presumptuous and Unionism growing dejected and uneasy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>We cannot see why this should be so, and sincerely trust that some prompt and efficient measures will be taken to avert calamities which seem to be hanging over us. The community is growing into an unwholesome excitement, and it will require the greatest delicacy and firmness to allay it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/> We do not believe that it is longer safe to allow the daily congregation of knots of citizens in the streets, a custom which has been tolerated, we think, under a mistaken notion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>From these little gatherings much evil may ensue, and as it is easier to prevent a mischief than it is to correct it and undo its consequences, we sincerely hope that the whole body of the people will, for a time to come, at least, be compelled to <q>&#x0022;move <num value="1">one</num>&#x0022;</q> The authorities are but playing with fire in a powder magazine, when groups are suffered to clog the sidewalks and occupy the corners in this community under existing circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>The following charming composition is furnished to the <hi rend="italics">Union</hi> by a correspondent: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> Yesterday afternoon, coming from <placeName reg="Old Point, Hancock, Maine" key="tgn,2557595">Old Point</placeName>, my attention was attracted to a party of she secessionists, who were rendering themselves conspicuous and offensive to the respectable portion of the passengers, by the disgraceful and insulting language they uttered against the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers, the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and Union people of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.--Prominent among this party were those who would have the world believe them the ladies <q>&#x0022;par excellence&#x0022;</q> of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>To the shame and disgrace of these women, be it said, their conduct was better adapted to a brothel house than a steamboat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/> I desire to ask you sir, whether there is any law in this country which can afford protection to the loyalist, and punish those who disgrace our steamboats and places of public resort by their presence and infamous conduct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/> What excuse is there, or can there be, offered by the military authorities for granting passes to this class to travel to and fro from our city to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, for no other purpose than to insult people, and act as spies for the rebel Confederacy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Has it come to this, that under the very nose of our <rs type="role" reg="Military-Governor">Military Governor</rs>, our soldiers and Union citizens are </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> to be subjected to the insults of rebel women, whose husbands and families are living upon the patronage of the very people they heap their billingsgate slang upon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The unladylike conduct of <num value="1">one</num> of these she secessionists to the guard, who politely asked to see her pass, after she got on board yesterday afternoon, was beneath the dignity of any honorable-minded woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>She should have been arrested, and an example made of her that would learn others of the same stripe to act with civility to our soldiers, and not treat them as though they were brutes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/> Can you, or can the authorities, explain why passes are so lavishly issued to these characters, while honest, honorable and loyal citizens have to stand back like poor men at a frolic, while these creatures are treated as though they had rights and privileges superior to Union men and women?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>It is high time that this much abused practice of granting passes to these well known parties was put a stop to. </p>

<head>By the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.<lb/>a Proclamation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/> The <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName> impelled by the sacred obligation to protect the citizens of this State from the usurpations and tyranny of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, having passed an act <q>&#x0022;to authorize a force of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men to be raised for the defence of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>,&#x0022;</q> it becomes my duty to endeavor to execute that act. And, notwithstanding the heavy calls which have been heretofore made, and which have been unflinchingly responded to by our people, yet I again confidently appeal to <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> to give their hands and their hearts to this undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, by overwhelming majorities of their Convention and Legislature, have solemnly announced to the world the purpose of this Commonwealth, under no conceivable circumstances, again to acknowledge allegiance to, or unite the destinies of our people with those of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Under these circumstances, it is their duty to put forth their power with whatever of energy may be at their command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>A large portion of the <rs>Western</rs> and Northwestern parts of the <rs>State</rs> has been in the occupancy of the enemy, and though there are as warm and as loyal hearts there as in any part of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, yet, from this untoward circumstance, they have been able hitherto to do but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The new force now called for is intended chiefly for the defence of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Is it expecting to much to ask these valiant men to come forth and aid in raising this force for this great and laudable object?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>The <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> have appointed a Western man to command this force &mdash; a man identified with you in interest by connexion, by family ties, by a noble ancestry, by long-tried public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>They have evinced their confidence in his ability, in his zeal, in his patriotism, in his devotion to the great cause in which we are engaged, by appointing him. Will you not rally to his standard, and give him the force necessary to make the law effectual?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Will not all <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> aid in this noble purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>If anything other than the love of country, and obedience to the call of your mother, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, be wanting, it will be found in the execrable acts of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>A recital of a few of these acts, which are undeniable, will suffice for justification in the eyes of the world: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/> The course they pursued previous to the war was more than sufficient to justify our separation from them; but their disgraceful violations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and of plighted faith since the war; their utter perversions of truth; their reckless disregard of justice and of the rights of property, and their departure, in numerous instances, from the usages of civilized warfare; the invasion of our homes and the murder of our peaceful citizens, render a connection with them in future odious to our sense of honor and abhorrent to our feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>It has produced an estrangement as enduring as if there was an impassable gulph between us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/> The Constitution, as they interpret it; the contempt of its provisions, according to their own interpretation; the laws made in conformity with it, and those in direct conflict with its plainest provisions, which are equally approved by them; the men who have been the instruments to execute their power and vengeance, and the hirelings who have pillaged our land, desecrated our churches, polluted our fair fields, sacked our towns, and insulted the innocent and helpless, render them alike detestable to us and disgraceful to humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/> They were bound by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to guarantee to us our rights, and protect us against invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>They have invaded us themselves, with the avowed object to subjugate and overwhelm us, to confiscate our property and banish us from our domain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/> They were required to give no preference by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of <num value="1">one</num> state over those of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>They have shut up all our ports and prohibited us from having intercourse with themselves or the nations of the earth, while they have left all of their ports open to the commerce of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>They have refused to permit us to obtain with our own means even the medicines necessary for our sick and wounded &mdash; articles never hitherto considered contraband by any civilized nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/> They were prohibited from forming or erecting a new State within the jurisdiction of any other State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>They have permitted an illegal Legislature, not acknowledged by the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of this State, or by a majority of our people, to profess to establish a new State within the jurisdiction of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, acknowledging the acts of the <rs>Governor</rs> of that State, receiving its Representatives and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> into the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> without the color of law, justice or right, and paying for their pretended services out of the public fisc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>They have granted to this pretended Governor money which they have acknowledged to be due to the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>They have authorized the raising of troops within this pretended State to war against our people and desolate the firesides of their brethren, and stimulated them to bloodshed and massacre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/> They have allowed vacancies in the <name>Representation</name> of this State to be filled by writs issued by the false Executive of this pretended State, against the express provision that the <rs>Executive</rs> authority of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> alone shall issue such writs, with the full knowledge on their part that the rightful Governor of this State had been undoubtedly and constitutionally elected by a majority of the entire population of the <rs>State</rs>, before the commencement of the war, and that he still continues in office under his regular appointment, and in which election the people of this pretended State participated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>They have permitted such Representatives to be elected by soldiers in the army, and not by people in the district, against an express provision in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, which prohibits soldiers in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from voting in such elections, thus recognizing the base traitor against his own State as a fit associate and colleague for Representatives who are entitled to the station, and allowing low pretenders to the position of <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to be dignified with that honorable distinction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/> They were prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>They have sent their myrmidons into churches and dragged our ministers from the sacred desk for a mere omission to put up a petition to the <name>Almighty</name> for their execrated <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>They have shut up our places of worship for the same cause, and prohibited our people from assembling together for the exercise of religious duties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/> They were denied authority to abridge the freedom of speech or of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>They have recklessly imprisoned private citizens, holding no office or position, civil or military, for expressing a mere difference of opinion with themselves, and for fearlessly uttering their sentiments; and even incarcerated our honorable women for similar cause, permitting their armed jailors to watch and insult them in the privacy of their cells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>They have placed the press of the country, wherever their power extends, under censorship, and in numerous cases prohibited the circulation of papers, broken up their forms, and scattered their types to the winds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> They were restrained from infringing the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>They have disarmed large portions of the people of <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> still in their Union, and hunted and baited those in others who have presumed to keep their own arms against their mandate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/> They were expressly prohibited from quartering soldiers in any house, without the consent of the owner, and not even in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law. They have not only thus quartered them, but they have instigated their soldiers when so quartered to plunder them of every valuable, and wantonly to destroy what their cupidity could not carry away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>They have not only shot down helpless owners who ought to have been reverenced for their age and sex, but have consumed the owners and their dwellings in <num value="1">one</num> undistinguished conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>And when they have professed to pay for property illegally obtained, they have paid the owners in pretended money, which they have previously criminally counterfeited and debased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> It was expressly provided that no person held to service or labor in <num value="1">one</num> State under the laws thereof, escaping into another, should, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but should be delivered upon claim of the party to whom such service or labor might be due. And yet they have openly instigated our slaves to escape, hold them by the power of the military arm, establish a commissariat for their subsistence, and give authority to their hypocritical priests and canting females to provide for their education and their temporal and spiritual welfare, perpetrating wholesale robbery and depriving owners of property guaranteed to them, in order to inculcate their fallible and uninspired doctrines into </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/> the minds of their miserable and deluded victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>They have taken from their owners such property without a pretence of compensation, and in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> liberated all the slaves, pretending to allow a mere pittance for their value and for that pittance have given promise to pay provided the owners, at the end of the war, should prove loyal to their odious Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/> With this catalogue of violations of solemn constitutional obligations, well may we say they keep no faith, and pervert truth, justice, and right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> When, in the history of civilized nations, has not been known that non-combatants, plain citizens, engaged only in farming pursuits, were imprisoned for having shown allegiance to their own State laws When has it been known that wives and pure and spotless maidens have been violated by soldiers without an effort on the part of their officers to pursue the perpetrators with the vengeance of the law. What civilized nation would not blush to conceal its own flag, the emblem of its nationality and honor, and hoist on the battle field the flag of an enemy in order to decoy that enemy into a murderous fire, and then glory in the meanness of the deception and the cowardice of the act? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/> What ancient or modern nation ever used a flag of truce to decoy an enemy in battle other than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Let history record the disgrace and brand the infamy upon their brew for all time to come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/> What ancient or modern nation would openly fire upon a public hospital, in which the sick, the wounded, and the dying, are being cared for by the generous and the kind-hearted, the surgeon and the <rs>Sister</rs> of Charity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>We brand it as a crime upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and call upon the historian to record it against them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> They were required to guarantee to every State a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Wherever their armies have obtained a foothold, they have established a military government and appointed military satraps and provosts martial to execute laws never sanctioned by the people or the government which they created, and have executed <unclear> trary</unclear> power, enforcing it by bayonets and at <unclear> th,</unclear> months of cannon, these military rulers issuing proclamations insulting to the people unknown <unclear></unclear> civilization and brutally disgraceful, compelling obedience by presenting the alternatives of submission or starvation, and by their mere military order, causing some of our most patriotic citizens to be ignominiously hung upon a charge of treason without trial and without law! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> Can any people be expected to submit to such wrongs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Will the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> tamely submit to such tyranny?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>If such acts are perpetrated while they have but partial control, what may we not expect when the demons have away and authority? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/> Citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the <rs>State</rs> appeals to you to add to your many noble exertions for the cause in which we are engaged, this <num value="1">one</num> effort to redeem unfair State from the hand of the oppressor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Make up the force now called for, and be prompt in your action. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Moving his column by the right towards <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, a series of brilliant encounters ensued in which the enemy were successively driven from entrenchments and rifle-pits, with the loss of many guns.
