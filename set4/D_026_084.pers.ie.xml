<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> I saw him <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> nearly <measure n="28years" type="date">twenty-eight years</measure> ago, when he proposed to become the illustrator of my earliest book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>He was very cheerful, and looked very bright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>In the night of that day week he died. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The long interval between these <num value="2">two</num> periods is marked in my remembrance of him by many occasions when he was supremely humorous &mdash; when he was irresistibly extravagant &mdash; when he was softened and serious &mdash; when he was charming with children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>But by none do I recall him more tenderly than by <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> that start out of the crowd when he unexpectedly presented himself in my room, announcing how that some passage in a certain book had made him cry yesterday, and how that he had come to dinner because he couldn't help it, and must talk some passage over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can ever have seen him more genial, natural, cordial, fresh and honestly impulsive than I have seen him at those times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can be surer than I of the greatness and goodness of the heart than then disclosed itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> We had our differences of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>I thought that he too much feigned a want of earnestness, and which was not good for the art, that he made a pretence of undervaluing his art that he held in trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>But when he fell upon those topics it was never very gravely, and I have a lively image of him in my mind, twisting both his hands in his hair, and stamping about, laughing, to make an end of the discussion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> When we were associated in remembrance of the late <persName n="Jerrold,Mister,Douglas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="default:Jerrold,Douglas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Douglas</foreName> <surname>Jerrold</surname></persName>, he delivered a public lecture in <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, in the course of which he read his very best contribution to <hi rend="italics">Punch,</hi> describing the grown up cares of a poor family of young children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>No <num value="1">one</num> hearing him could have doubted his natural gentleness, or his thoroughly unaffected manly sympathy with the weak and lowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>He read the paper most pathetically, and with a simplicity of tenderness that certainly moved <num value="1">one</num> of his audience to tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>This was presently after his standing for <placeName reg="Oxford, Lafayette, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057155">Oxford</placeName>, from which place he had dispatched his agent to me with a droll note (to which he afterwards added a verbal postscript) urging me to &#x0022;come down and make a speech, and tell them who he was, for he doubted whether more than <num value="2">two</num> of the electors had ever heard of him, and he thought there might be as many as <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> who had heard of me.&#x0022; He introduced the lecture just mentioned with a reference to his late electioneering failure, which was full of good sense, good spirits, and good humor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> He had a particular delight in boys and an excellent way with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>I remember his once asking me with fantastic gravity, when he had been at <placeName reg="Eton, Jackson, Missouri" key="tgn,2319483">Eton</placeName>, where my oldest boy then was, whether I felt as he did in regard of never seeing a boy with out wanting instantly to give him a sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>I thought of this when I looked down into his grave, after he was laid there, for I looked down into it over the shoulder of a boy to whom he had been kind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> These are slight remembrances; but it is to little familiar things, suggestive of the voice, look, manner never, never more to be encountered on this earth, that the mind <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> turns in a bereavement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>And greater things that are known of him, in the way of his warm affections, his quiet endurance, his unselfish thoughtfulness for others, and his munificent hand, may not be told. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> It, in the reckless vivacity of youth, his satirical pen had ever gone astray, or done amiss, he had caused it to prefer its own petition for forgiveness long before: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> In no pages should I take it upon myself at this time to discourse of his books, of his refined knowledge of character, of his subtle acquaintance with the weakness of human nature, of his delightful playfulness as an essayist, of his quaint and touching ballads, of his mastery over the <rs>English</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Least of all, in these pages enriched by his brilliant qualities from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the series, and beforehand accepted by the public through the strength of his great name. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> But on the table before me, there lies all that he had written of his latest and last story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>That it would be very sad to any <num value="1">one</num>--that it is inexpressibly so to a writer &mdash; in its evidences of matured designs never to be accomplished, of intentions begun to be executed and destined never to be completed, of careful preparation for long roads of thought that he was never to traverse, and for shining goats that he was never to reach, will be readily believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The pain, however, that I have felt in perusing it has not been deeper than the conviction that he was in the healthiest vigor of his powers when he wrought on this last labor.--In respect of earnest feeling, far seeing purpose, character, incident, and a certain loving picturesqueness blending the whole, I believe it to be much of all his works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>That he fully meant it to be so, that he had become strongly attached to it, and that he bestowed great pains upon it, I trace it in almost every page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>It contains <num value="1">one</num> picture which must have cost him extreme distress, and which is a masterpiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> children in it, touched with a hand as loving and render as ever a father caressed his little child with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>There is some young love as pure and innocent and pretty as the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>And it is very remarkable that, by reason of the singular construction of the story, more than <num value="1">one</num> main incident usually belonging to the end of such a fiction is anticipated in the beginning, and thus there is an approach to completeness in the fragment as to the satisfaction of the reader's mind concerning the most interesting persons, which could hardly have been better attained if the writer's breaking off had been foreseen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> The last line he wrote, and the last proof he corrected, are among these papers through which I have sorrowfully made my way. The condition of the little pages of manuscript where death stop ped his hand shows that he had carried them about, often taken them out of his pocket, here and there, for patient revision and interlineation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The last words he corrected in print were, And my heart throbbed with an exquisite bliss.&#x0022; <name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant that on that <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas eve</occasion></dateStruct>, when he laid his head back on his pillow and threw up his arms as he had been wont to do when very weary, some consciousness of duty done and <name>Christian</name> hope throughout life humbly cherished, may have caused his own heart so to throb when he passed away to his Redeemer's rest! </p>

<head>The representative man.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> A Lincoln journal advocates the re-election of that person to the <name>Presidency</name>, on the ground that he is the best representative man of the average masses of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> (<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>) people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> There are various classes of human being in that heterogeneous compound, but, taking the average, the allegation of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> journal is probably not wide of the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Certainly there is a small minority which he does not represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>There is a minority, as small, we fear, in proportion to the whole population, as that of Lot in <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName>, who have nothing in common with <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>There are men like <persName n="Hopkins,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="mostcommon:Hopkins,R.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Hopkins</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, who not only have never bowed the knee to Baal, but have denounced the hideous idol and his worship from the moment that his hideous features saw the sun. These men are not politicians; they have never dabbled in that miry pool, but they are educated gentlemen, who would be an honor to any country, and have always been not less the enemies of fanaticism than the champions of virtue, morals, and religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Here is <num value="1">one</num> class which <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> does not represent, and which has no more affinity of any kind with him than the same class of gentlemen in the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> Another portion of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> people, of whom <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> cannot be considered the representative man, is the class of public men of whom <persName n="Pierce,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, is a notable example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They are few in number, indeed, and <persName n="Pierce,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00248" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> is left almost alone to gild with solitary grandeur the desolate Northern sky. &#x0022;Faithful among the faithless, &#x0022; he has breasted the furious wave of popular passion without once stooping his proud crest to the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>However other men, once professing the same political principles, may have turned, or temporized, or gone bodily over to their once execrated enemies, he has scorned to give an inch to the myrmidons of fanaticism and despotism, and has preferred the brightness of an unsullied conscience to the favor of the multitude or the friendship of a powerful Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> But men of the stamp of <persName n="Hopkins,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="mostcommon:Hopkins,R.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Hopkins</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pierce,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> are few indeed in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Their numbers are too small to secure protection even for themselves.--Their characters, instead of giving them influence, are a standing rebuke to the iniquity and madness of the populace, and therefore render them objects of hate instead of reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>In any civilized country citizens of such wisdom and purity would be the recognized leaders of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The very fact of their being out of office and having no connection with the party issues and party organizations of the day would impart to their sentiments a more commanding influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Their words of wisdom would be welcome as refreshing rains upon a parched soil, and their calm, majestic names would rise up in the midst of the universal commotion like massive light houses on the borders of a stormy sea, surrounded by the waves, but not yielding to them, and sending forth a clear, unbroken radiance to guide stormiest mariners to a haven of security and repose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> These exceptions apart, the claim of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> paper that its <rs type="role2">President</rs> is a representative of the average intelligence and moral character of the <rs>North</rs> cannot be disputed.
