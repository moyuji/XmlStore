<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They sent forward a detachment with <num value="8">eight</num> pieces of cannon along the <placeName reg="Corn Brook, Bartholomew, Indiana" key="tgn,2031483">Brook</placeName> road to the vicinity of <orgName type="battery" n="Battery 9">Battery No. 9</orgName>, and formed a line of battle on <placeName><persName n="Taylor,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,M.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> from the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The line was formed of cannon, supported by dismounted sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The latter approached during the artillery duel which ensued to within <measure n="175yards" type="distance">175 yards</measure> of the battery, being shielded by <placeName><persName n="Parker,Colonel,J.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="default:Parker,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, near the turnpike From this point they succeeded in killing <num value="1">one</num> and wounding <num value="3">three</num> of our men, belonging to the command of <persName n="Stephens,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, at the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> After the artillery duel had terminated, about <time value="4pm">4 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Their camp-fires were visible for some distance from the surrounding country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They were not permitted, however, to rest in peace during the night, notwithstanding their rapid marches and excessive fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>About <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> a part of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s Legion, which had been following in their wake, directed some shells into their illuminated camp, the effect of which is left to conjecture, except that it is known to have greatly expedited their departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>They did not stay to finish their nap, and stood not upon the order of their going, but quitted the place at once. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>They avoided Mechanicville, however, taking the route by Hawe's shop.--Their subsequent movements must be developed by further news, which, if it comes to hand, will be added to this account. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> During the short sojourn of this column of the raiders in the <rs type="place">Brook</rs> neighborhood they took a great deal of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>These, with a number of other robberies and kidnappings, they perpetrated on this side of the <rs type="place">Brook</rs>, and went on robbing and stealing, no doubt to the end of the chapter on the other side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>They took a number of citizens not in the army, and after detaining them for some hours set them at liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Our informant, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the number thus taken, states that, according to the report of the <rs>Adjutant</rs>, the number of this division of the enemy amounted to <num value="3400">3,400</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Our informant also gathered from the same officer that the command of <persName n="Gregg,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gregg</surname></persName>, which approached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> through <placeName reg="Goochland, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002163">Goochland</placeName>, numbered <num value="3600">3,600</num>, making the aggregate of the <num value="2">two</num> divisions <num value="7000">7,000</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Whilst the operations above mentioned were going on the <rs type="place">Brook turnpike</rs>, the column of the enemy which went into <placeName key="tgn,2002163" n="1.000 17" reg="goochland, virginia, united states">Goochland county</placeName> were ascertained to be approaching the city by the <rs>Westham Plankroad</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>A portion of the city troops, consisting of the <rs type="place">Armory</rs> battalion, <persName n="Ford,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Ford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Ford</surname></persName> commanding, the <name>Department</name> battalion, <persName n="McIlhany,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:McIlhany,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>McIlhany</surname></persName> commanding, and another battalion under <persName n="Waller,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Waller,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Waller</surname></persName>, were sent out to check their progress and arrest their march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Before the battalion was fully aware of the proximity of the enemy, or the numbers they were confronting, a fire was opened upon them, and several of the men killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The fire of the enemy was returned, and we have reason to believe not without effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Finding themselves outnumbered, and the other battalion not having yet come up, the <rs type="place">Armory</rs> battalion commenced falling back, turning and firing upon the enemy as they retired. --This was kept up for about a mile, when they were met by the <name>Department</name> battalion, which at once formed in line of battle and made ready for the approach of the enemy, who it was understood were pursuing the <rs type="place">Armory</rs> battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>At this point the advance of the enemy was arrested, but we again lost several in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>During the night no further attempt was made by the enemy to advance on the city, and under the cover which the almost impenetrable darkness of the night afforded, they moved off, and are supposed to have finally united with the column that had been so unceremoniously disturbed in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,2119163" n="1.000 3" reg="meadow bridge, fayette, west virginia">Meadow Bridges</placeName>. </p> </div4>
