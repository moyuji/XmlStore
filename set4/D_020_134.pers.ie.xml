<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> The appropriations to cover deficiencies are rendered necessary by the excess of the force in the field over that upon which the estimates were founded, and by extraordinary expenditures connected with the employment and discharge of the <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> contingent. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>A call for the troops was immediate made; but so numerous were the offers that it was found difficult to discriminate in the choice, where the patriotism of the people demanded that there should be no restrictions upon enlistments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Every portion of the loyal States desired to swell the army, and every community was anxious that it should be represented in a cause that appealed to the noblest impulses of our people. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> As stated in my last report, at the commencement of this rebellion, the <rs>Government</rs> found itself deficient in arms and munitions of war, through the bad faith of these intrusted with their control during the preceding Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The armory at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> having been destroyed to prevent its possession and use by the rebels, the <rs>Government</rs> was compelled to rely upon the singed armory at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, and upon private establishments, for a supply of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Every effort has been made to increase the capacity of that armory, the greatest product of which, prior to there troubles, had never exceeded see muskets per mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>In charge of an energetic and able ordnance officer, the force being doubled, and operations vigorously prosecuted day and night, there were made at this establishment, during the past month of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, a total of <num value="6900">6,900</num> muskets; and it is confidently expected that <num value="10000">10,000</num> will be manufactured during the present month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>On a recent visit, with a view to enlarge the capacity of the armory, I directed the purchase of a large quantity of machinery already finished, which, when put in operation, will enable this establishment to produce during the next year <num value="200000">200,000</num> stand of the justly celebrated <name type="weapon">Springfield rifles</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I respectfully suggest the recommendation of a liberal appropriation by Congress for the purpose of yet further increasing the capacity of this armory, believing that it can be made sufficient to supply all the muskets and rifles which the <rs>Government</rs> may hereafter need in any contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Located in a healthful country, in the midst of an industrious and ingenious people, where competent workmen can always be obtained without difficulty, and sufficiently near to all the materials needed in the manufacture of arms, it is at the same time accessible to every part or the country by water and railway communication. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> After having made contracts for arms with the private establishments in this country, it was deemed necessary by the <rs>President</rs>, to insure a speedy and ample supply, to send a special agent to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, with funds to the amount of <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of dollars, to purchase more.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> The demand for arms has called into existence numerous establishments for their manufacture throughout the loyal portion of the country, and it has been the policy of this Department to encourage the development of the capital, enterprise, and skill of our people in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The Government should never have less than a <num value="1000000">million</num> of muskets in its arsenals, with a corresponding proportion of arms and equipments for artillery and cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> In my last report I called attention to the fact that legislation was necessary for the reorganization, upon a uniform basis of the militia of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>In the absences of any general system of organization, upwards of <num value="700000">700,000</num> men have already been brought into the field; and, in view of the alacrity and enthusiasm that have been displayed, I do not hesitate to express the belief that no combination of events can arise in which this country will not be able not only to protect itself, but contrary to its policy, which is peace with all the world, to enter upon aggressive operations against any Power that may intermeddle with our domestic affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>A committee should be appointed by Congress, with authority to sit during the recess, to devise and report a plan for the general organization of the militia of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> I recommend that the system of promotions which prevails in the regular service he applied to the volunteer forces in the respective States; restricting, however, the promotion to men actually in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>At present each Governor selects and appoints the officers for the troops furnished by his State, and complaint is, not unfrequently made that when vacancies occur in the field, men of interior qualifications are placed in command over those in the ranks who are their superiors in military experience and capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The advancement of merit should be the leading principle to all promotions, and the volunteer soldier should be given to understand that preferment will be the sure reward of intelligence, fidelity and distinguished service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The course above recommended has been pursued by this Department, and it is my attention, so far us is in my power, to continue a system, which cannot fall to have a most beneficial effect upon the entire service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> By existing laws and regulations an officer of the regular army ranks an officer of volunteers of the same grade, notwithstanding the commission of the latter may be of antecedent limit the opportunity for distinction of volunteer officers, and a change should be made by which seniority of commission should confer the right of command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> I submit for reflection the question whether the distinction between regulars and volunteers, which now exists, should be permitted to continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The efficiency of the army, it appears to me, might be greatly increased by a consolidation of the <num value="2">two</num> during the continuance of the war, which, combining both forces, would constitute them <num value="1">one</num> grand army of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> Recruiting for the regular army has not been attended with that success which was anticipated, although a large number of men have entered this branch of the service.--While it is admitted that soldiers in the regular army, under the control of officers of military education and experience, are generally better cared for than those in the volunteer service, it is certain that the popular preference is largely given to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Young men evidently prefer to enter a corps officered by their friends and acquaintances, and beside the county granted to volunteers in most of the <name>States</name>, inducements are often directly offered to them by those whose commissions depend upon their success in obtaining recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>In addition, the volunteer is allowed to draw his full pay of <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">$13</measure> per month, while by law <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">$2</measure> per month his deducted from the pay of the regular, to be returned to him at the end of his term of service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> In my judgment this law should be repealed, and the regular soldier be allowed to receive his full pay when due. He should also, receive either a reasonable bounty upon enlisting, or an advance of <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> of the <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> which a law of the last session of Congress grants to regulars and volunteers on the expiration of their periods of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>This would doubtless stimulate enlistments, as it would enable the soldier to make some provision for those dependent upon him for support until he receives his pay </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> By the act approved <date value="1864-08-05">August 5, 1864</date>, the <rs>President</rs> is authorized to appoint as many aids to <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs> of the regular army, acting in the field, as he may deem proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The number of aids, in my opinion, should be limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>In view of the injurious operation of this law, and of the facilities which it opens to frauds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>I respectfully urge its early repeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> Corporations, like individuals, are liable to be governed by selfish motives in the absence of competition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>An instance of this kind occurred in the management of the railroads between <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>As this rate seemed extravagant to the department, when considered in connection with the great increase of trade upon these roads, made necessary by the wants of the <rs>Government</rs>, inquiry was made concerning the expediency of using the roads from New York to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> via <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as long as there was any such power really in existence, felt a sufficient degree of respect for itself not to recognize the so-called Republic of Hayti, founded by negro slaves upon the dead bodies of their masters; whom they had massacred in cold blood, and with an atrocity to which there is no parallel in the history of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Applications were made from time to time, and once during the administration of <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, an envoy or agent of some kind was sent over here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>But Congress uniformly rejected all overtures from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Now, however, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation having been substituted for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the fellowship is considered congenial and pastoral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Accordingly, it is recommended to fraternize with Hayti.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The Hayti negro is a good enough associate for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will have a Hayti plenipotentiary in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to figure at his diplomatic dinners, and form an object of attraction at his decrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Nor is this all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>But the most remarkable proposition is that for colonizing the negroes stolen from the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will not take them home to them and give them the freedom of their cities on terms of equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Still another is, that the forces were originally thrown on the island for the purpose of erecting the necessary defences to control the entrance to our harbor, and having finished the work were taken back to the rendezvous on <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName>, or to construct fortifications at some other point. </p>
