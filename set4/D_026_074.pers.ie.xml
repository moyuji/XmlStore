<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But this would be to forget the chivalrous feeling of which the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have given such abundant proof during the past <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> If there are men ready to desert causes that seem to be in peril, there are others, (and it is often the majority, be it said to the honor of humanity,) who press more closely near their flag when threatened by superior numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>To expect to disarm soldiers respected even by their enemies, by talking to them of the relative weakness of those who remain true to their cause, is to ignore the highest, the noblest, the most consoling trait of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is to ignore patriotism No!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is unbecoming the dignity of the press to degrade itself by such inventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Its mission is more grave and serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It is the duty of the press, especially at such critical times as these, to tell the truth, the whole truth, bitter as it may be. Men who are not wholly deprived of sense, sooner or later tear the well under which it is attempted to conceal it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We do not know it she still has shoes to cover her feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>But at all events, judging from the enthusiasm of her soldiers, we believe that her bare feet would be ready, as in the past, for the hardest marches &mdash; Her soldiers, if wanting shoes, would no doubt repeat the noble and touching words of a veteran of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <name>French</name> revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It is idle, it is dangerous to be misled in the strength of <num value="1">one</num>'s enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> What effect the enormous Federal bounties offered to <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> soldiers may have in tempting more of that hitherto misguided people into the ranks of our enemies it is impossible to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>But it is clear that very great inducements must be offered to prevail upon any considerable number of them to enter a service where so many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> have only attained a bloody grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>It is reported &mdash; and we are inclined to believe the report &mdash; that the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> are becoming generally disaffected to the war, and that the influence of their clergy is exerted in conformity with the pacific and Christian counsels of the <rs>Pope</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> have always been the best soldiers in the <rs>Federal</rs> armies, and the absence of this fighting element from future battles would render the enemy less formidable than at any former period of the war. They may substitute negroes, but they will only excite our dericion; or they may ransack the Old Word for mercenaries to do the fighting of a nation which is afraid to fight for itself, but a people who have encountered and defeated <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> have no reason to fear any other human foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> The <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> ought to be with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, because it was the <rs>South</rs> which resened them from the political and religious persecutions which the <rs>North</rs> had organized against them a few years ago, because it is only in Southern independence that they can look for a refuge from the same persecutions, which will be revived against them when this war is ended as inevitably as the rising of to-morrow's sun. <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> would cease to be <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> if it had not a victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>And its whole history attests that, of all its victims, there is none which it so loves to hunt, and worry and devour as the religious faith of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Anti slavery is a mere episode; detestation of Catholicism is its whole existence; its mother's milk, its blood, marrow, muscle and bones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Every Irishman knows that, from the hour of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s horrible excesses in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, to the present moment, the religion that the <name>Irishman</name> loves above all things, the <name>Puritahates</name> above all things, and desires above all things to degrade and destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Nothing keeps this appetite now in abeyance but the progress of this war. Even that is not sufficient to suppress altogether the vindictive animosity awakened by the <rs>Pope</rs>'s late letter, a manifestation of Christian and friendly regard to a struggling and heroic people which the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> will never forgive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>There was a time, even at the beginning of the war when the sentiment of nationality and idolatry of the <rs>Union</rs>, was the dominant idea of the <rs>Northern</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>But what has become of Unionism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Where is Conservatism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The man in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who utters these words makes himself a laughing stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The Conservatives and the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs>, with their liberal political and religious ideas, area weak and helpless minority, and <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>, armed to the teeth, with its foot upon the prostrate laws and liberties of the <unclear></unclear> hand, reigns the supreme master of the nation at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and even drives on <rs n="Roman Catholic" type="religion">Roman Catholic</rs> <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> to fight its battles and perish in its slaughter pens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Will it be more mindful of their religious than it has been of their political rights, when it has the opportunity of glutting its innate and ineradicable hatred of the <rs n="Roman Catholic" type="religion">Roman Catholic</rs> religious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Let the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> take warning in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The Confederacy once conquered and such flames of religious persecution will be kindled in the <rs>North</rs> as the world has not beheld for centuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>But if <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> fails in this struggle, as to all human appearances it will fail, it becomes thenceforth as impotent as it is malignant; the <rs>North</rs> itself will turn upon and crush it as the author of its ruin; it will perish politically and ecclesiastically, and the freedom and religion of all mankind will be the better for its perishing. </p> </div3>
