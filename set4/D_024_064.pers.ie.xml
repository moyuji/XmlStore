<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> <placeName key="tgn,2022925" n="1.000 25" reg="fort mcallister, bryan, georgia">Fort McAllister</placeName> has been made the object of <num value="7">seven</num> attacks from the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>That the reader may better understand the position of affairs, we would state that <placeName key="tgn,2022925" n="1.000 25" reg="fort mcallister, bryan, georgia">Fort McAllister</placeName> is situated on the right bank of the <placeName key="tgn,1128019" n="1.000 51" reg="ogeechee, georgia, united states">Ogeechee</placeName>, and occupies the farthest point of mainland jutting out into the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The river flows straight from a point about a mile above the fort to a distance of about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> below, where it makes a bend and runs almost south and behind a point of wood, thence onward to <placeName reg="Oshawa Sound">Oshawa Sound</placeName> and the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>During the afternoon of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <num value="3">three</num> iron Monitors &mdash; the <rs>Montauk</rs>, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> supposed, from the descriptions in the New York papers, to be the <rs>Passaic</rs>, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> the <rs>Weehawken</rs> &mdash; steamed up from behind the point of wood, rounded the bend, and came up to within a short distance of the fort, the <rs>Montauk</rs> about <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">1,000 yards</measure> off, and the other <num value="2">two</num> in the rear, some <measure n="150yards" type="distance">hundred and fifty yards</measure> from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Here they Anchored in line of battle for the next day, and the night was passed in quiet, both sides no doubt busy with preparation for the work of the morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Around the point, and a little over <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles distant</measure>, lay <num value="3">three</num> mortar schooners and an old steamer, which also took part in the fight and kept up a rapid fire throughout.--Such was the force and disposition of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The <rs>Montauk</rs> and another iron-clad were armed with <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> and <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> gun each, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> with <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8 inch</measure> rifle guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The mortar boats threw <num value="10">10</num> and <measure n="13inch" type="distance">13 inch</measure> shells. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Our battery remained us in the former fight, except that it had been reinforced with a <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10 inch</measure> columbiad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Another part of our force was a detachment of rifles, <persName n="McAllister,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McAllister,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>McAllister</surname></persName>, under command of <persName n="Flatbee,Lieutenant-3,B.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Flatbee,B.,A.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-3">3d Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Flatbee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>These men went up the river and crossed over the marsh by night to a point about <placeName><distance reg="250yards">two hundred and fifty yards</distance> from the <rs>Montauk</rs></placeName>, and in full rifle range, where they dug out a rifle pit in the mud, and remained the greater part of the fight, it is believed, not without important success, as will be seen hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Thus stood matters up to <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, when our troops, wearied with waiting on the enemy, opened on the <rs>Montauk</rs> with the rifle gun. The <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> columbiad, <num value="42">42</num> pounder, and <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10 inch</measure> columbiad, followed suit in the order in which they are named, all <unclear></unclear>directing their fire on the <rs>Montauk</rs>; indeed, she was the only <num value="1">one</num> of the iron-clads that we shot at during the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The rent were doubtless much disappointed at not being &#x0022;tested.&#x0022; The <orgName n="Savannah Republican" type="newspaper">Savannah <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi></orgName> gives an interesting recount of the assault, which conclusively proves that iron-clads against land works are not invulnerable: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> At <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> the <rs>Montauk</rs> fired the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun and was followed by her associates in rapid succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Thus commenced the firing on both side, and the deadly strife was kept up steadily for <measure n="7.5hours" type="date">seven and a half hours</measure> without the slightest intermission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Considering the strength of the combatants reportorially, and the immense weight of metal thrown in terrific grandeur there has been nothing like it since the commencement of the war; indeed history furnishes no parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is estimated that the enemy threw some <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> shot and shell at the fort amounting to some <num value="60">sixty</num> of <num value="70">seventy</num> tons of the most formidable missiles ever invented for the destruction of human life.--Only thick of <num value="11">11</num> and <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> round shot, and rifle shells <measure n="8inches" type="distance">8 inches</measure> in diameter and <measure n="17inches" type="distance">17 inches</measure> in length, screaming along their destructive way like to many fiery demons, plunging into the earthwork's of <placeName key="tgn,2022925" n="1.000 25" reg="fort mcallister, bryan, georgia">Fort McAllister</placeName> to the depth of <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure>, or exploding with a voice of thunder and the jar of an earthquake, for more than <num value="7">seven</num> mortal hours, over, around and in the midst of our undaunted little band of patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Form and quarter they stood to, their guns through it all, and at the close, with a defiant shot and shout of victory, saluted the retiring foe. Such a fire was never directed against mortal man before, and they came out not only unscathed but triumphant from the fiery ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>About mid- day a <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> shell struck the upright post of the <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8 inch</measure> columbiad and slivered the entire carriage to stem; the gun was consequently lost to them for the <unclear></unclear> of the day. The main traverse wheel of the <num value="42">42</num> pounder was carried away by a shot and replaced within <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> in the midst of a terrific fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> About <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> past <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> P. M a shot from our <num value="42">42</num> pounder struck the body of the <rs>Montauk</rs>, a volume of steam was soon to leave from her side, and her turret refused to revolve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>She immediately weighed anchor, turned her how down stream, and retired from the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The fort gave her a parting salute as she rounded, to which she replied by <num value="2">two</num> random shots--<num value="1">one</num> of which went up the river, and the other across the march &mdash; as much as to say to her troublesome customer. &#x0022;If I can't whip you go to the d &mdash; l&#x0022; The fort fired the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and the last shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In a few minutes the other <num value="2">two</num> rams turned about and followed their file leader which, on making the bend below, was taken in tow by a steamer, as if in a damaged condition.--This conclusion is supported by the testimony of our pickets, who report that her pilot house was taken down and the men were at work on her during the whole of that night and the day following. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Thus ended the fight with the exception of a slow but continued fire, which was kept up from the mortar boats from behind the point of wood throughout the night, in order to prevent repairs on the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If, however, did little or no damage, nor did it cause a suspension of the work for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The garrison being pretty well worn out by the labors of the day. <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Schnaff,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Schnaff,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Schnaff</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> of sharpshooters volunteered to make the necessary repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Though under fire these brave men continued their work throughout the night, and at daylight the dismounted columbiad was again in position, all the breaches repaired, and the fort in complete order for another trial of strength with her formidable antagonists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>At dawn the men were again at their guns; but hour after hour passed and no enemy hove in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had received their fill, and concluded to let us alone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <persName n="Elarben,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Elarben,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <surname>Elarben</surname></persName> and his little band had taken their position under cover of the marsh, within rifle shot of the enemy's rams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of extreme peril, being not only exposed to a raking fire from the gunboats should they be discovered, but also in a direct line with the fire from the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>During the fight an officer made his appearance on the deck of the <rs>Montauk</rs> with glass in hand, and presented the long wished for target.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>A Maynard rifle slug soon went whizzing by his ears, which startled and caused him to right about, when a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> slug apparently took effect on his person, as with both hands raised he caught hold of the turret for support, and immediately clambered or was dragged in at a port hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It is believed that the officer was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The display of awning on the <rs>Montauk</rs> the day following, and the funeral on <placeName key="tgn,7013087" n="1.000 1" reg="oshawa, ontario">Oshawa</placeName>, <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, give strength to the opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> As soon as this shot was fired, the <rs>Montauk</rs> turned her guns upon the marsh and literally raked it with grapeshot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The riflemen, however, succeeded in changing their base in time and avoiding the missiles of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of them was hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Too much credit cannot be bestowed on this daring act of a few brave men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The damage done to the garrison was confined to the wounding of <num value="1">one</num> man in the knee, and another slightly in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Considerable havoc was made in the sandbanks in the fort, and the quarters of the men were almost entirely demolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The officers' quarters received <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> shots, but suffered no material damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Inside the fort, and to the rear and left of it for half a mile, the earth was dug up into immense pits and furrows by the enemy's shell and shot, a large quantity of which has been gathered up, and will be returned to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in a different form, should the occasion offer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> It is almost incredible that our troops should have remained under such a fire for so long a time and not <num value="1">one</num> of them be killed or seriously wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Indeed, their safety would seem to throw suspicion on the whole account of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But it is all true and why it is so cannot be accounted for on any principle of natural law. The escape was miraculous, and can only be ascribed to that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>All seeing eye that wateriest over the actions of men, and that Omnipotent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Arm which is ever stretched out to uphold the right and shield from harm the cause of the just and oppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We might name a number of extraordinary incidents that occurred during the bombardment that battle human reason and irresistibly turn the eye of the require up to Him with whom all things are possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> A shell fell and exploded in the pit of the rifle gun, where a number were serving, and but a single fragment was left on the floor, yet no <num value="1">one</num> was hurt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> Several officers were lying in the door of the hospital, and <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> others standing around outside, and not <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet distant</measure>, when a <measure n="5inch" type="distance">5 inch</measure> shell struck the bank and rolled down to the very door-sill and exploded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>All were burnt with the powder, but not <num value="1">one</num> was turned by a figment of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Where they went to who can tell? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> An officer of the fort, whose word no <num value="1">one</num> will dispute informed us that the shells from the mortar boats at night, or many of them after being <unclear></unclear> aimed and coming in an exact crave for the fort ever a distance of <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, when nearing it, without any natural cause, and as if by army gentle unseen hand, were turned aside and felt to the right or left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>All were amazed at the remarkable phenomenon, and puzzled to explain it. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> The most intense regards of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are now fastened upon <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Why the projected attack hangs fire so long is a mystery to everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Nearly a month has clapped since the <rs>British Consul</rs> was ordered by his superiors to &#x0022;stand from under,&#x0022; and every <num value="1">one</num> held their breath in expectation of a terrific crash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Then it was postponed till the <date value="03-01">1st of March,</date> and the <date value="03-01">1st of March</date> having come and gone, we now hear that it is to be the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The preparations, military and naval, are of the most for minable kind; but perhaps it has been discovered that the defences are equally so. The General in command at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> is not a man to count any necessary precautions, and the people are among the most <unclear></unclear> and circumspect of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>We have often had occasion to call attention to those qualities of <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> character, for which they have not generally received credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>They are supposed to be a head-over-heel, impulsive race, never looking before they leap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>It is a great mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>They are as remarkable for their forethought, and for taking time by the forelook in all great enterprises as the <name>Bostonian</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>If they had not been, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> would have fallen in the beginning of the war. But it has always been ready for any force the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> could bring against it.--It is in a mere complete state of preparation now than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It is powerful in its fortifications and in its guns, but more powerful than all in the deep and universal determination of every man, woman and child in it that the city shall be destroyed rather than fall into <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/> The supreme malignity with which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> look forward to their revenge on <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> will not be gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>They may burn the place up, they may make it a heap of smoking ruins; but the city, the community, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, will never be there to roll under their tongues as a sweet morsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/><placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> remembers the fate of New Orleans, and would rather be levelled even with the ground, and have the plough share run through the place it was built upon, than submit to such a fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>It was bad policy in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to let loose their vengeance upon New Orleans as they did. They forget their usual craft and cunning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>If they had behaved with ordinary humanity, the resistance of other Southern cities might have been less desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>But, henceforth, no Southern city that is defensible, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> least of all, will be permitted to fall into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>A few days may test the truth of this prediction as far as <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>We hope to be able to record, not only the disappointment, but the crushing defeat of the vindictive enemy. </p> </div3>

<head>The Northwest.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> It is in vain that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press seek to disguise the serious disaffection which prevails in their Western provinces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The Northwest, which like the <rs>South</rs>, has been always made tributary to the manufactures and commerce of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and which has borne the brunt of the present war, is beginning to sigh for peace, or if peace cannot be otherwise obtained is preparing to calculate the value of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>We do not imagine that this feeling is universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> element is of course for war, and wherever there is a strong infusion of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> population, as there is in many portions of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, we need expect only the most embittered and implacable hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>But the mass of the <rs>Northwestern</rs> population is not <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The majority is not <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The interests of the <rs>Northwest</rs> are with the <rs>South</rs> and not with <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>That it has furnished the bravest and hardiest troops to the <rs>Union</rs> during the war, is no evidence of its intense Yankeeism of character or peculiar hatred of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The qualities of courage and resolution are in general allied with generosity and chivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>The men who faced each other in the death grapple at <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' may, in reality, be more alike and have more sympathy with each other than the <rs>Northwest</rs> and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>It is true that the <rs>Northwest</rs> is the home of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>; button is in a minority in his own State, in his own county, and his own town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>When we speak of the <rs>Northwest</rs> we speak of the party which is in the ascendant, and of what its evident interests dictate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>For the interests of a people are the only key to its policy, and the interests of the <rs>Northwest</rs> are with the <rs>South</rs>, and not with <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/> What, then, should be the course of the <rs>South</rs> to the <rs>Northwest</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>In the first place, to fight them with knives in both hands till we have driven them off our soil, and made them thoroughly understand that wants the very last process on the face of the earth by which they can obtain an unobstructed and prosperous navigation of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, or by which, even if successful they can obtain anything but a desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>We must fight them to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>A few great, crushing victories will be the best and only efficacious inducements to peace we can offer them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Not that we presume upon their timidity or resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>They have demonstrated their fighting qualities beyond all dispute, and can afford, without lose of reputation, to relinquish a war which is only ruinous to their prosperity, and in which they are only made subservient to the interests and passions of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/> The Northwest has in itself the materials of a great empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>There is room enough in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> for <num value="3">three</num> Republics, and it would be for the common interest, and maintain a proper balance of power, that there should be <num value="3">three</num> instead of <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>We can all live in greater peace and her many apart than under <num value="1">one</num> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>With the <rs>Northwest</rs> our relations would necessarily be friendly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>It seems to us that there is nothing inconsistent in the stern determination to be exterminated rather than be conquered by the <rs>Northwest</rs>, and the avowal of our readiness to respond in a friendly spirit to all amicable demonstrations from that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The motive by which these demonstrations are prompted may be of interest; if so, that only makes it more certain that the demonstrations are in earnest and mean business. </p> </div3>
