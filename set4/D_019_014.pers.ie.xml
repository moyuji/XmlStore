<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The declaration inserted by the <name>States</name> who then signed articles of Confederation, that there should be <orgName n="Perpetual Union" type="union">perpetual Union</orgName>, amounted to a construction by them that the right was inalienable and was implied, and not necessary to be reserved expressly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>There is an equality of obligations as well as equality of rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>As no <num value="1">one</num> should doubt the right of secession, reserved expressly by <num value="3">three</num> States, upon the principle I have mentioned, every other State is entitled to exercise the same right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The present Constitution contains no declaration that the <rs>Union</rs> shall be perpetual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>We have, therefore, the authority of each of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> States that seceded from the articles of the <name>Confederation</name>, separately, for what we have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The right to do so now is a constitutional <num value="1">one</num>, because it was reserved expressly or implied by the ratification of each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Each State had admitted every other State to be a sovereign State; but each State is entitled to exercise this right by the law of nations on such a compact as this for violations of it which the free States have committed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>If <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> nations, civilized and Christian at the date of the treaty between them, should afterwards become piratical, or authorize her citizens to practice robbery, it would be sufficient cause for the other party to put an end to it. If in a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, between <num value="2">two</num> States, <num value="1">one</num> should not only fail in a case requiring it to send troops to aid the other, but add them to the force of the enemy of her ally, it would be most ample cause for the injured party to abandon the compact which had existed only to <unclear></unclear>. In all such cases the aggrieved party has the right to put an end to the treaty forever, and reject all offers to renew the violated covenants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The covenant in the <rs>Constitution</rs> that <num value="1">one</num> object of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is to establish justice, has been by most of the free States construed, under their higher law, to mean that it is praiseworthy to steal negroes or to aid them in their flight &mdash; that the covenant to deliver a fugitive indicted for a crime against the laws of a slaveholding State is construed to mean nothing unless the act charged in the indictment be a crime also according to law against the <rs>State</rs> in which the felon has taken refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In the case of <num value="2">two</num> of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s followers, murderers and invaders of this State, the <rs>Governors</rs> of free States refused to deliver--<num value="1">one</num> escaped to <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs> another to <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The refusal was upon a pretext &mdash; the real ground, I believe, was because they had done nothing more than invade a slaveholding State, to incite a servile insurrection, which failed because the slaves would not enlist under them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Another object of the present Confederacy was to secure domestic tranquility, which has been perverted by the believers in the &#x0022;higher law,&#x0022; to keep up constantly excessive agitation on the most exciting subject, slavery; and, by way of variety, once in the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> the leaders have treated us to the invasion of the most powerful of the slaveholding States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> The time for a <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">general Convention</orgName> of the slaveholding States is after the separate secession of them, or of as many of them as will secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The right is a separate <num value="1">one</num>; each State acceded separately to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and each must secede separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The right is founded on the right of self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>If all the slaveholding States were to meet in Convention to decide on the question of secession, and agree to be bound by the will of a majority, the minority, whether for or against secession, could not exercise their right of self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>If they were against secession they would be bound by the will of the majority to secede, as they would be if in favor of secession to remain in the <rs>Union</rs> if the majority preferred to do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/> --A correspondent of the <rs>Country Gentleman</rs>, writing from <placeName reg="Scotts Hill, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076550">Scott's Hill, N. C.</placeName>, says </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/> &#x0022;The principal crop raised in this vicinity is the pea-nut, or ground peas, as they are generally called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>They promise to be very good, as the season has been very favorable for them.--In my section of the country there are <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> bushels raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>We consider them more profitable than cotton, where the land is suitable for their culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>They have been a source of great wealth to this section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The following is the mode of cultivation: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> &#x0022;The ground is well broken and then checked off <measure n="2.5feet" type="distance">two and a half-feet</measure> each way. --<num value="2">Two</num> shelled peas in the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>After they are up, they are cultivated by running a sweep <num value="16">sixteen</num> or <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> in width both ways, over which the ground is stirred well around the plant, and all the grass taken out. Very little dirt is put around the place, as nearly level culture is the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>This process of working must be continued every <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, until they meet and cover the ground, when grass will cease to grow, which is about <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> from the time of planting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>They require very neat culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>The pea grows entirely in the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>They blossom as the field pea, but they put out a stem from the bloom which penetrates the ground about <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure>, when the pea is formed on the end of it. They are dug with a plow made for that purpose, passing under the bunch, of sufficient depth to loosen the ground and set up until they are thoroughly dry, when they are picked off at leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>It is a difficult matter for an inexperienced person to know when they are ripe enough to dig; but when nearly all the leaves are shed, and the peas, on opening, nearly all present a reddish appearance, they will do for digging.
