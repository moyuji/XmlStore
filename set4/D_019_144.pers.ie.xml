<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>As usual in cases of military movements in the city, curiosity prompted large numbers of people to assemble on the sidewalks and at the doors and windows of residences, to survey the man&#x0152;uvres of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Their passage was in no way interrupted, and as far as we can learn there were no exhibitions of any kind calculated to arouse the least feeling of hostility.--There was no hooting or abusive language on the part of the spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Situated about <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> from the mouth of <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>, at a point a mile in width, the hill or bluff upon which we have erected our fortification seems of itself a frowning battlement; and crowned with our heavy columbiads it presents no very inviting appearance to the blockading squardron which may be seen from time to time hovering in the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> beyond, almost constantly since our arrival here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>This is of course intended as a check upon Southern commerce; b ut despite their vigilance, a number of our vessels have effectually run the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>We have anxiously awaited an attack, but the recent Federal repulses by the <name>Aquia</name> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> and other batteries, have taught the blockading fleet a lesson they will not soon forget. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/> In addition to our battery, and an extended line of redoubts surrounding our camp, numerous and strong entrenchments have been thrown up in rear of and on either side of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>These, with the strong force of the various arms of the service in and near <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, render the place, we may safely say, almost impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>But more to be relied on than the strength of our position, in its natural or artificial advantages, is the unconquerable enthusiasm of those who hold it. If he <q>&#x0022;is thrice armed who hath his quarrel just,&#x0022;</q> then may the defenders of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> securely meet our hireling invaders with the calm confidence of certain victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>And here, on this classic ground, hallowed by the clustering memories of an earlier revolution, we will fight a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> battle in the same holy cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Each man among us feels that he is doing battle for his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>All that we have, or can hope for, is involved in this issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The homes we fight for are the heritage bequeathed us by sires who won them from invasion on many a hard- fought field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Here sleep those noble sires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>It was on Southern soil we drew our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> breath, and the fond recollections of our childhood are all here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Those dearest to us in life are breathing the same sunny air, and the spirits of our loved and lost have winged their homeward flight through Southern skies, while their bones are mouldering in Southern soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> In such a cause, and with such incentives to action, the <rs>South</rs> is invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>That patriotism, that love of country which binds us so firmly together, has its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> origin at the family hearth-stone, thence sends its eddying circles abroad, embracing an undivided South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>There are few among us who have not left at home some kindred dear ones, for whose sake, in whose defence the hardships and perils of war are cheerfully endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>There are eyes beaming on us in our dreams by night to light us on to the victories of the morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>There are lips awaiting us whose whispered welcome will be worth more to us than the loudest trumpet notes of fame; and surely there is none among us who may not look forward to that <num value="1">one</num> reward, the consciousness of duty done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> Since our arrival here, the health of the various camps has been generally good, and our troops have endured the hardships inseparable from a life on the tented field with the fortitude of veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>There have been <num value="2">two</num> deaths, and those in the ranks of our neighbors and fellow- soldiers, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1LARegiment">1st Louisiana Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>They had come from their far-distant homes at their country's call, to fight her battles &mdash; perchance to seek the bubble reputation at the cannon's mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Sad and untimely was their fate; and as their comrades-in-arms bore them towards their last resting place, (<num value="1">one</num> a mere boy &mdash; dead, too, on the eye of <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2036878;tgn,2016605" n="0.143 000000.8553	placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.116 000000.6983	placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;0.095 000000.5702	placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America">Bethel</placeName>'s victory,) few eyes were undimmed, no heart untouched by the melancholy scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Perhaps their loved ones at home are waiting even yet to read of victories in which those dear to them may hold a part, or looking eagerly to the day when they may bid them welcome home again, our independence and our peace restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>We, too, through the gloom of the present, look forward to that day. Though we are all eager for the fray, and mindful that none but the brave deserve the fair, yet we cannot forget the bright eyes and dewy lips we have left behind us, whose approving smile we look to as our choicest meed of praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>But I weary you and must conclude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>In my next I hope to tell you of another and more glorious victory. </p> <closer> <signed><orgName n="Peyton Battery" type="battery">Peyton Battery</orgName>.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> the detachment of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">1st Regiment</orgName> stationed at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>, with the <rs>Warrenton</rs> and <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName></persName>, Rifles, received orders to march to this place, which I must say did not please our boys very well; for having been sent forward, they did not like the idea of going backward when the enemy was almost within sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>There was, however, no other alternative as good soldiers but to obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Accordingly, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, after an early breakfast, we packed up our duds for a tramp; <num value="1">one</num> which we somewhat dreaded too, for it bid fair to be a day, even as early as this, (<time value="5am">5 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Soon, however, wagons came and took our baggage and drove into the road leading to <orgName n="Fairfax Station" type="station">Fairfax Station</orgName>, at which we were very much gratified.--We then fell into line and were reviewed by <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, (I have heard that he has been promoted to that position,) the citizens generally, and the ladies particularly, many of whose eyes were filled with tears; and as the hearty drops were seen to chase each other down their cheeks, it could and did not fail but to produce a like emotion with us, and as we turned to get the last gaze and wave of handkerchief, the prayer went up from many a heart, may <name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless them and may they never want for a defender while an enemy's foot pollutes <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s soil!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Many of these had been driven away by the presence of the enemy so near them, and had but just returned to their homes; and to be again left defenceless, seemed to us to be cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Such, however, we soon learned was not to be the case; for after waiting some time at the station where the train arrived, we discovered that it was filled with troops, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1ALRegiment">1st Alabama Regiment</orgName>, better known as the <rs>Raccoon Roughs</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> When we arrived here, we were met with open arms and <num value="3">three</num> cheers from our companions of the old <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, whom we had left behind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/> It is extremely warm here &mdash; much more so, apparently, than at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>, and we are suffering for want of a sufficient number of tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Some of the companies have none at all, and all of them are in want of more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>We have <num value="10">ten</num> men in tents that are calculated to hold only <num value="6">six</num> men. This is far too many for comfort in this hot weather, as well as prejudicial to our health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Our officers may have applied to the proper authorities for them; but if they have, I must say that they are a long time coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>This is not as it should be; for a sufficient time has elapsed since we have been in service for us to be supplied at least with necessary articles; comforts we do not expect, such as we had at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>I mention this, for you may not be aware of this want, and I am confident were it known that they would be forthcoming, at least enough to make us more comfortable. </p>
