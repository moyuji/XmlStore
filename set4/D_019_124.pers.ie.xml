<head>The painter's bride.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/> Very near the close of the <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> century a family named Solario occupied a hut in the suburbs of Christi, the capital of the <placeName reg="Calabria" key="tgn,7007850">Abruzzo Citra</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>It was thatched with reeds and twigs, and a couple of holes in the wall admitted light and air. In the centre were some smooth stones, on which the fire was kindled, the smoke of which cased it in soot like a lining of ebony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>A kettle or <num value="2">two</num>, a few stools, a rough table, a pile of leaves covered with sheepskins, and a rude crucifix, formed its furniture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>A magnificent white dog stretched himself at length before the door, a cat purred by the hearth, and the donkey and pig made free of the establishment &mdash; went in and out at pleasure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/> But all this did not matter much, since it was not a <hi rend="italics">home,</hi> nor even a <hi rend="italics">dwelling,</hi> but simply a shelter for its nominal inhabitants at such times as its stifling atmosphere and unsavory scents were more endurable than the cold and storm without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Especially might this be said of the little <rs>Antonio</rs>, who often slept upon its roof, and took his meals of hard bread, oil, salt and goat's cheese, by the water tank which served the peasants in that quarter of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>There, at least, he could feast his eyes if not his palate, and could either add to the enjoyment of his dessert of chestnuts and pine seeds, or could lighten the labor of masticating an unusually tough crust, as the case might be. Built upon a high hill, the city commanded a view of a wide and fertile valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Noble vines were trained and tended in great vineyards, or clambered untamed from tree to tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>The soft gray of the olive contrasted with the shining foliage of the laurel hedges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>The square lower of a convent rose out of a group of cypresses, and a hamlet of silk growers was just visible in its framework of lofty mulberries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Pyramids of evergreen verdure, uplifted upon the tall trunks of the stone pines, dotted the broad grain fields, which were shut in by the <rs type="place">Maiella Mountains</rs>, with their woods and crags. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/> But not even the pleasant laugh and gossip, or the twang of old Biblio's guitar, could-give to the cool plant-fringed rim of the basin a charm equal to that of <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>'s own nook in a corner of a <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>There the deep, tender gloom of gigantic ilexes, and the flickering shadows of lighter growths, fell upon the close turf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>The thorn showered its petals like snow-flakes over the magical mosaics wrought by lovely blooms, by white and rose-flushed anemones, sweet violets, daisies, and the golden cistus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Shattered pillars in various positions waved with creeping plants, which had fastened upon their tops and went swaying downward with a wild and careless grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>Here an exquisitely moulded torso was wreathed with the rich flames of the scarlet cactus &mdash; there vast shafts of granite were embedded among thick, juicy aloes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Along the crumbling wall grew patches of light-hued moss, red gillyflowers, and masses of fragrant honeysuckle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Thither <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>, in scanty jacket and sheepskin trousers much the worse for wear, daily led his goats; and while they browsed around him, he drank in the beauty of each time and season, and was melted to a pleasing sadness by the traces of buried centuries, though he knew not why. More than once, also, he went with a neighbor to the valley of Orient, where the water fall of that name makes its double leap from the stupendous heights of Monte Cavello and Monte Mucchia in long reaches of living crystal, until breaking into foam in its rocky bed, it fills the pass with rainbow-tipped spray, and sends its thunderous music far through the dim gorges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>He sought, too, shaggy cliffe, bare and pitiless, rock-strewn ravines, silver and purple with clinging lichens, and tangled glens, through whose green roof the sunbeams slowly sifted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>He prepared for his life-task by this hearty companionship with nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Unconsciously, however, for he knew nothing of art except through a few hard angular Madonnas in the churches of Chieta, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> in a better style by <persName n="Steffani,,Thomas,,,de" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="expanded:Steffani,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Steffani</surname></persName> and Gennarodi Colo, in the <name>Convents</name>, whither he had sometimes gone on Saints day with myrtle garlands and bunches of wild flowers for the high altar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>His ambition took a much more humble direction, and the utmost that he desired was to become a coarse smith, and to have a hammer and anvil like his <persName><roleName n="Uncle">uncle</roleName> <foreName>Pietro</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Fortunately, <persName><foreName>Pietro</foreName></persName>, liking his honesty and modest self-reliance, smoothed all difficulties, made him as good a craftsman as himself, and then sent him to <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName> with a new jacket, a handful of bajocchi, and his benediction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>There <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>'s quickness and ingenuity enabled him to attempt nicer work than his master had executed, and alternately striking hard blows on the glowing iron, mending a pan for an old woman, or an ear-ring for a young <num value="1">one</num>, he found his position quite to his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>But this care-free state was destined to be of short duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Colantonio del Flore, the then only painter of distinction in <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">southern Italy</placeName>, had a daughter of bewitching beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>She was yet a child, and <num value="1">one</num> morning on her return from school she tripped lightly up to <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName> with her missal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>She had broken the clasp; would he mend it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>The padre, her master, would be angry at her carelessness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>The very moment the smith saw her sparkling face, and marked her graceful step, half timid and half eager, his heart was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>She must give directions &mdash; must stay, really, to see the work done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Possibly he might not otherwise please her. Then, as she hesitated, he began a mountain story, so overflowing with arch merriment that it was impossible to go. He called her Violetta, (Violet,) and afterward was perpetually in venting some innocent little artifice to draw her to his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>It was truly wonderful how he always happened to have such a surplus of pretty tokens, which she must accept simply to help him to get rid of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Now it was a cluster of fine cherries, which they ate together, but of which the smith was careful not to take too many; then it was a dish of choice figs, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>More substantial, but still simple gifts, followed, ending with a dog from the <name>Chilti</name> cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>In time, the interviews must have become more confidential, for, after <num value="1">one</num> of them, Violetta burst into del Fiore's studio, exclaiming: </p> 
<div4 type="dialogue" n="1"> 
<head></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/> &#x0022;Dear Father, will you believe that I have had an offer?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/> &#x0022;Of a tart or a bunch of grapes, I suppose.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/> &#x0022;No, indeed, father, it was an offer of marriage, just such as grown ladies have?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/> &#x0022;May I be permitted to inquire the gentleman's name?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/> &#x0022;<persName n="Solario,,Antonio,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00393" reg="default:Solario,Antonio,,,"><foreName>Antonio</foreName> <surname>Solario</surname></persName>, the handsome smith by the <name>Capuan</name> gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>You know him, father.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/> &#x0022;And may I ask what was your reply?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/> &#x0022;I said that you would not give me to any but a painter; and he replied that he would then be a painter himself &mdash; that he was already half of <num value="1">one</num>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/> &#x0022;And what then?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/> &#x0022;He asked me how long I would wait for him, and I answered <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>; we were young and could well do so. And that is all, only he is coming to ask for me an hour be fore vespers&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/> &#x0022;Ha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>ha! ha! ho! ho! ho!&#x0022;laughed del Fiore. &#x0022;Well, child, go to you nurse.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/> &#x0022;But what shall you say to <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>, dear father?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/> &#x0022;Oh, I shall say yes, of course; you will forget him in <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/> And del Fiore turned to his easel and thought no more of his daughter's suitor until he stood before him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/> &#x0022;Signor del Fiore,&#x0022; said the smith, &#x0022;I have come to ask the hand of your daughter.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/> &#x0022;But you are not a painter, Solario.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/> &#x0022;May I marry her if at the end of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> I can prove myself <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>and will you promise that during my probation she shall not be in any way influenced against me?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/> &#x0022;Certainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>She shall do as she chooses &mdash; entirely as she chooses.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/> &#x0022;Then may I bid her farewell before I leave <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/> &#x0022;But are you not making too much of this affair, Solario?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>Violetta is young, and youth both changes and forgets.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/> &#x0022;I do not think so, <persName n="Signor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00394" reg="mostcommon:Signor,nomatch:0"><surname>Signor</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>At least, let me hope&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/> Del Fiore withdrew, and in a few moments Violetta appeared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/> &#x0022;My own darling bride,&#x0022; whispered <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>, &#x0022;I must bid you good by. Your father would not, for many reasons, desire me to remain with him as a pupil, and I could not see </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/> you daily, yet wait so long to marry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Dear Violetta, do not forget me, and do not doubt my faith, for we of the <name>Abruzzi</name> love once and forever.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/> &#x0022;But where are you going?&#x0022; asked Violetta, sadly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/> &#x0022;To Lippo Dalmatio, at <placeName reg="Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna" key="tgn,7004847">Bologna</placeName>; and you shall yet be proud of me, my sweet little wife.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/> &#x0022;I am proud of you now. Oh, <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>, do not, do not go.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/> &#x0022;I must, Violetta; but I shall return if Madonna pleases, and we will be very happy together.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/> Then sealing his betrothal with a kiss, <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName> hurried away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/> Then raillery of which Violetta became the object was certainly injudicious, if it were intended to detach her from <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>She believed herself a martyr, and bore it bravely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>It also kept him in mind, and words and intonations, on which she would not otherwise have bestowed a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought, recurred to her with all their tender meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>Each claimant for her hand was compared by her with her betrothed, as he had appeared to her in the rose light of her young fancy; and however gay, wise, or accomplished, she in variably found him hard and cold beside the picture of memory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/> In time <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName> began to be mentioned among the prominent pupils of his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>He was becoming known; he was studying the works of Vivarini, in <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>; of Bicci, in <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>; of Galasso, in <placeName reg="Ferrara, Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna" key="tgn,7004264">Ferrara</placeName>; of Pisanello and Fabriano, in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/> The <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> went by, and del Flore stood <num value="1">one</num> lovely morning in rapt admiration before some charming paintings which had just been hung in his studio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Good perspective for the period, naturally arranged drapery, and heads full of expression, fixed his delighted gaze.--He was aroused by the pressure of a little hand which softly clasped his own, and beheld kneeling before him Violetta and <persName><foreName>Antonio</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/> &#x0022;Yes, yes, my children, &#x0022; he said; &#x0022;yes, yes, I know what you would have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Yes, marry in welcome, and the sooner the better.--Really, love does wonders &mdash; that is,&#x0022; he added, thoughtfully, &#x0022;when it has anything to work upon.&#x0022; </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
