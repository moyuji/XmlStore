<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>This were to give the lie to <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="nearbymention:Seward,W.,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, and to prove to the world that the rebellion, so far from being nearly extinguished, is more formidable than it ever was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>What sort of half-conquest can that be which it requires <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num> of fresh troops to completes?
