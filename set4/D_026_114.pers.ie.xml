<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Speculation was rife in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> yesterday as to the strength of the force now in the vicinity of the city and their designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The prisoners who were brought in give very different accounts of the force, though all agree that there are &#x0022;<num value="3">three</num> divisions.&#x0022; What <num value="3">three</num> divisions in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army number we are unable to say; but of this we may be certain, that if the force had been a very strong <num value="1">one</num> it would never have allowed <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> to dog it all the way from <placeName reg="Ashland, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2110477">Ashland</placeName>, attacking it whenever it chose and gaining advantages, without having turned upon it and given battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The design of the enemy, as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> planned, was doubtless to come to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and make a demonstration upon it, which was to be answered by co-operation from the force on the south side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The appearance of a very large army of Confederates on the southside has interfered with <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s plans, and prevented the co- operation which was expected, and the heavy force of troops in the city was also a surprise to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This cavalry raid has now been away from its base of operations for <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure>, and by this time the forage for their horses and provisions for their men must be nearly exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Yesterday morning, about sunrise, the enemy, finding that the <rs type="place">Meadow bridges</rs>, over the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, were burnt, attempted to go down the <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On this road they were met by a body of infantry (the name of which command need not be stated) and repulsed, after a brisk fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They then fell back into a dense body of woods, on <placeName><persName n="Taylor,Mister,H.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Taylor,H.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Scrawberry Hill">Scrawberry Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>To the edge of this woods, which is distant from the city fortifications about <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure>, across a field, they advanced their artillery and some infantry skirmishers, and commenced a brisk fire.--our infantry skirmishers advanced and drove them from the edge of the wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>During most of the day the fighting here was kept up without much effect on either side, very few of our men being killed or wounded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They went into the fight, and with great gallantry attempted to <unclear>lodge</unclear> the enemy from some breastworks of logs and rocks that he had thrown up, but found them too strongly posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They then fell back across a field to a wood on this side within range of the enemy, and here a spirited firing was kept up until <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, when the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA19">19th Virginia</orgName>, <persName n="Gant,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Gant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gant</surname></persName>, was sent up to relieve the battalion companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They, however, declined being relieved, and remained until their ammunition was exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> the whole force was ordered back, and the firing ceased. </p>

<head>Power of ordnance.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> Each turret contains <num value="2">two</num> guns, and from the peculiar facility which it has for giving direction to the heaviest ordnance, no doubt arises the desire to make these of the heaviest description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>How far other considerations should control the character of the ordnance, is necessarily an unsettled question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> To strike an armored ship, it may be best to use a gun capable of the greatest power; but whether this shall be derived from a projectile of great weight, driven by low velocity, or of less weight and high velocity; whether it shall be a <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15-inch</measure> gun, fired with <num value="35">thirty five</num> or <measure n="40l." type="pounds"><num value="40">forty</num> pounds</measure>, or a <measure n="13inch" type="distance">13 inch</measure>, fired with <measure n="50l." type="pounds"><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> of powder, is not here material; the weight of the gun for either purpose will not vary to any important degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>But in operations against earthworks, whose material cannot be damaged permanently, but only disturbed, and which are only to be dealt with by keeping down their fire, a much lighter projectile would be preferable, in order that the practice may be as rapid as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Hence a piece of <measure n="16000pounds" type="mass">16,000 lbs</measure> for <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10 inch</measure> or <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> shot and shell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> When a number of monitors are brought together, it would be better also to have guns of like kind in each turret, and bringing into action which ever might be preferable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> Each of the monitors of this squadron had a <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> and a smaller gun, <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> or <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8 inch</measure> rifle, and hence the rapidity of fire which was most desirable was not attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>That this was due to the calibre of the gun, and not to its being located in a turret may be shown by <num value="1">one</num> notable instance. </p>

<head>The Ironsides.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The Ironsides is a fine powerful ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Her armor has stood heavy battering very well, and her broadside of <num value="7">seven</num> <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> guns, and <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> rifle has always told with signal effect when opened on the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The defects of the vessel are the unplated ends, which are consequently easily damaged by a raking fire, and involve the rudder and screw more or less, while she can return no fire in either direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>This was particularly and frequently inconvenient in attacking the works on <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>, for at certain stages of the tide vessels tall nearly across the channel, and present bow and stern to the beach of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>So that sometimes it was necessary to delay placing the vessels in position, and at others she would swing around very awkwardly when engaged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The monitors, on the other hand, were almost equally well defended on all sides, and could fire in any direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The Ironsides was also open to descending shot, and her scope of fire too much restricted by badly placed ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The desire for comparison which rages just now can easily be satisfied by bringing the above data in juxtaposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Just as they are, the <rs>Ironsides</rs> is capable of a more rapid and concentrated fire, which, under the circumstances, make her guns more effective than the <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> of the monitors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> On the other hand, she was restricted by draft to the mid-channel, was very vulnerable to the raking fire, and the direction of her own guns was very limited interally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The monitors could operate in most of the channels, could direct their fire around the whole circle, and were almost equally well defended on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The defects in both classes of vessels are susceptible of being remedied partially or entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The defence of the <rs>Ironsides</rs> could be made complete, and that of the monitors equally so. The armament of the monitors equally could be perfected so as to give all desirable rapidity of fire, but by no contrivance could the <rs>Ironsides</rs> be enabled to use much heavier guns than those mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Yet when such changes were made as experience suggested, there still would remain to the monitors the lighter draft, choice of guns from the heaviest to the lightest, defensibility, and direction of fire around the whole circle; consequently the ability to carry a heavier battery into the least depth of water, with equal power of offence and defence in any direction, and that with half the number of guns carried in broadside by another vessel. </p> </div4>

<head>Comparison of Iron-clads.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> The comparison now made is to be understood as having relation to existing circumstances, and not at all intended as conclusive in regard to the general merits of iron-clads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> It is in this sense that the action of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> is to be considered with reference to the selection of <num value="1">one</num> class of vessels over another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> It is evident that it was not designed to adopt any <num value="1">one</num> style exclusively, for of the <num value="3">three</num> vessels <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ordered, <num value="2">two</num> were of the ordinary broadside class &mdash; the <rs>Ironsides</rs> and the <rs>Galena</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The latter was quickly proved to be absolutely inefficient, and so must any armored steamer of that size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It is universally admitted that plates of less than <num value="4.5">four and a half</num> (<num value="4.5">4 &#x00BD;</num>) inches cannot stand the shock of heavy projectiles, and vessels so armored must be of considerable tonnage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>I presume the <name>Department</name> only intended to build such vessels as were best adapted to the service at the scene of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> Keeping in view the peculiar exigencies of the case, which required light draft and great ordnance power, it appears that the selection of the <name>Department</name> could not have been more judicious in preferring a number of monitors to operate from a heavy frigate as a base; and of the intent of the <name>Department</name> could have been carried out in regard to numbers, we should now have been in entire possession of the coast from the <name>Capes</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to New Orleans, including <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> Many detects of both classes are easily remediable, but some of those in the monitors could only be determined by the lost of battle; before that, approximation only was possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> What other style of vessel could the <name>Department</name> have chosen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Certainly none that has been built by <name>English</name> or <name>French</name> naval authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The Warrior and her class are exceedingly powerful, but could not get within gunshot here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>On the other hand, there is very little navigable water on the coast which is not accessible to the monitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>They command supremely all that is near the shore, and cannot themselves be reached by vessels of heavier draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>So that when there was some reason to apprehend the appearance of certain rams in this quarter, I assured the <name>Department</name> that the iron-clads could maintain position so long as coal and provisions lasted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> It may appear that I speak too positively on the subject, but some experience with them certainly gives a right to do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> With a single exception, I have been on board a monitor in all the principal actions, and the recurrence of casualties to the <rs type="role" reg="Fleet-Captain">Fleet Captains</rs> near me shows that I was in a situation to judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> Yesterday was the <hi rend="italics"><num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> day</hi> of the strife for the possession of this city, and it is not yet taken by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government proposed, by its grand combination, to have accomplished the work with certainty and promptness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But there has been a hitch in each Department of the strategic schedule; and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, as far as appearances can signify, is as far from failing into the invaders' power as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The large force under <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Gen,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gilmore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Gilmore,nomatch:0"><surname>Gilmore</surname></persName>, has been performing a dance of forward and back, and cross over, without acquiring any advantage since the day it landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>On the contrary, it has been repulsed whenever it advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Still it lingers, apparently for some thing to turn up. The mounted infantry raid will fail, and the whole question of the situation reverts to the <num value="2">two</num> great armies now confronting each other on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>If <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> finally defeats <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, the question is settled for <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>He goes home, and, if he follows the fate of his disappointed and defeated predecessors, to the shades of retirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>He will not be allowed to turn politician and run for the <name>Presidency</name>, like <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, who took care to make a &#x0022;masterly retreat,&#x0022; which he called a &#x0022;change of base,&#x0022; and to impute the embarrassments which led him to this course, to the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Yet he may win the day on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> still not fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>In every engagement, thus far, he has been sorely baffled, and thus will he continue to be foiled until he withdraws' or until his expedition is more immediately ended, by complete disaster. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> Suppose he tries a change of plan, by effecting a junction with <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, either in the <rs>James</rs> or the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>: Either movement will enable <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to profit by a concentration that will make him fully equal to meet the force thus accumulated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> The capital is safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The Government is determined to defend it, and the army and its heroic leaders, are competent to the task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The suspense and agony of the struggle tries the spirit of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>But a short time of this painful ordeal, will bring relief &mdash; the sweet repose of quiet and security, and the joy that the capital of our beloved mother <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has again been saved from the ruthless invader. </p> </div3>

<head>A contrast.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> The contrast between <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> parade, sensationalism, bluster, and bragging, and the conservative sentiment, sincerity, and freedom from all affectation and bluster, of the <rs>Southern</rs> character, may be very happily illustrated by the customs of the press of the <num value="2">two</num> peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Had the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had <num value="1">one</num> tithe of the military success that has crowned the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms within a few weeks, not a day would have passed that the huge dailies of the principal Northern cities would not have had columns of jubilation and boastful accounts introduced by flaming displays of capitals of all sorts, forming captions sometimes as long as the narratives they introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Here the most signal victories are announced plainly and truthfully, without parade or balderdash &mdash; just as they should be to a sensible, sincere, and intelligent people, who are not to be misled or unduly excited by flaming and bombastic announcements, and by exaggerated and boastful narratives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The presses cater for entirely different people, and therefore their styles are entirely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It is due to the press to say that the style here entirely accords with the spirit of its conductors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>If the people wanted a different kind of press, a different set of conductors would be found no doubt to meet their wishes, but neither the people nor the editors desire anything else. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> Another marked distinction between the papers of the <num value="2">two</num> countries is the uniform frankness and truthfulness of the <rs>Southern</rs> press, with regard to defeats of our arms and to facts even painful; such as those of the currency, the supplies and, indeed, every other public matter, painful or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>If truth is alluded to on an affair of public concern, it is not with the purpose of disguising it. But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press is false, deceitful, and unscrupulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It deals as much in suppression of truth as in suggestion of falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/><num value="1">One</num> great agent of the invasion is lying, and the press takes charge of that column of attack upon the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The nature of its strategy is, however, now so well understood that it has no more effect here, or we may say in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, than had upon the <rs>English</rs> that corps of horrible looking men which formed part of the <name>Chinese</name> army, whose business it was to strike terror to the enemy by their gongs, loud noises, summersaults, and grimaces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> This war is a stern reality.
