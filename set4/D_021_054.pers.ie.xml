<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> The public mind of the entire <rs>South</rs> is fast recovering from the causeless panic occasioned by the unfortunate affairs at <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Considerate men see that much ultimate good may come of them, by inuring us to defeats that must often occur in a war with a power possessed of inferior numbers and superior resources of all kinds, by curing us of that rashness which our continued successes had begotten,--and, most of all, by stimulating enlistments, and thus increasing the numbers and efficiency of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It is now almost certain, that by <date value="04-01">the 1st of April</date> we shall have a larger disposable force in the field than that of our enemies; for they must retain <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> to guard and retain that State and the <rs type="place">City of Washington</rs>, a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> to hold those States, some <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> in their various forts, and probably <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> in their fleets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> Thus, their stationary force being <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num>, even if their armies <num value="700000">number seven hundred thousand</num>, they will have a disposable force of only <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> with which to invade our interior; and, in long incursions, this will be diminished at least <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> by the forces detailed to keep up communication with their bases of operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Besides, by deferring their invasion of the <rs>South</rs> until the warm season, they will soon decimate their ranks by the malarious diseases of our climate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> Heretofore we have had to fight against superior numbers, but so soon as they quit their vessels, march into the country, and meet us in the open field, we shall outnumber them, if we please, in every conflict. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> They cannot probably hold <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> longer than the rainy season keeps the <placeName reg="Poor Fork Cumberland River, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,2592540">Cumberland river</placeName> flooded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>We know not how large an army they have there, but believe it cannot be very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Should we be mistaken, and they attempt to hold it permanently, we ought in a few weeks to make prisoners of their whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> If, with their whole land and naval force, and their eager appetite for cotton, they durst not attempt to descend that river, they will surely not now venture to do so with a crippled and divided navy and army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>They cannot make that city a base of operations from which to invade the <rs>Cotton States</rs>, for in a few weeks, probably days, the <placeName reg="Poor Fork Cumberland River, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,2592540">Cumberland river</placeName> will become unnavigable for the smallest gunboats, and they would be cut off from their Northern supplies and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>If they attempt it even with a force of a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men, we should at once surround them with a force of a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num>, and capture their whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>This would end the war; and we should not be surprised that it should end somewhat in this way. The <rs>North</rs>, under weight of debt and want of cotton, is becoming desperate, and will rashly quit its wooden walls ere long and march far into our interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Then we will make prisoners of their armies, and gloriously and triumphantly wind up the war. Let faint-hearted people recollect that we never yet met them with equal numbers in the open field without defeating them, and that under the levy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> which is now going on in the <rs>South</rs>, if they invade us by land after <date value="04-01">the 1st of April,</date> we will meet them with superior numbers.--Our bad roads will prevent their invading us sooner. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>We copy a portion of the <q>&#x0022;incidents:&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> Notwithstanding the present haggard and war-worn appearance of the prisoners, were they washed and shaven, and otherwise recruited after their late fatigues, they would be a noble looking set of men. They were uniformly courteous in their intercourse with visitors &mdash; much more so, we regret to say, than a few blackguards who visited them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/><placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 4" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">The Tennessee</placeName> men whom we met invariably said that they had enough of fighting, and if they could be liberated would at once settle down to a quiet life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Many expressed a wish to settle in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The <rs>Mississippians</rs>, when interrogated simply said that they would wait till they <q>&#x0022;got well out of this scrape&#x0022;</q> before they said anything about it &mdash; their air and bearing, though courteous, betokening that they were ready to continue the fight and carry it to the bitter end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the captives, a <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> of fine form, and used to war from his childhood, sought out a captain in <orgName n="cavalry regiment"><persName n="Voss,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Voss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Voss</surname></persName>'s cavalry regiment</orgName> almost immediately upon entering the camp, and made known his desire to enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>He said he had been compelled to fight with <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName> and other men of his stripe, against the flag he loved, and now he wanted to make amends by fighting on his own account against the traitors and their serpent colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>We left the captain arguing the question of propriety with his commanding officer, who probably advised the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> to let the matter rest as it was for a time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/> A little, <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">three-foot</orgName>-<num value="6">six</num> fellow, apparently about <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> old, was in <num value="1">one</num> of the regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> suggested that he must be a drummer, or something of that sort.--<q>&#x0022;No sir,&#x0022;</q> said he, <q>&#x0022;I shoulder a musket, by G--!&#x0022;</q> He had certainly attained to maturity in profanity, if nothing else. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/> A laughable incident occurred, which will perhaps teach the offender that a rebel may be as quick at a repartee as any other man. A soldier had given a <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> bonnet to a rebel who had lost his head-gear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>An officer of the <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> regiment, who chanced to notice it, commenced bantering him about disgracing a <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> bonnet by placing it on a rebel's head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/><q>&#x0022;Thank God!&#x0022;</q> exclaimed Reb., <q>&#x0022;it is only a matter of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>I had rather be in h--<num value="11">11</num> than be a Scotchman!&#x0022;</q>--That officer suddenly came to the conclusion that he had business in some other part of the camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/> Nothing observed by the <name>Secession</name> prisoners seemed to astonish them more than to see the manner in which our citizens visiting them were dressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Mississippians</name>, who at home was considered somewhat of a wag, said: <q>&#x0022;I rather conclude it is the <name>Sabbath</name> day up here; the people all seem to be dressed in their Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes!&#x0022;</q> Seeing that an inquisitive <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> was eyeing him rather sharply, the same man remarked, <q>&#x0022;aside:&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Wonder if that man ever saw me before!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>If he hasn't, it's all square, as I never saw him until now, and I don't care if I never see him more.&#x0022;</q> And the joker turned his head without a smile, and accepted a ping of tobacco from a reporter who had gone to camp with his pockets filled for the purpose of distributing to the new arrivals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/> Some few of the prisoners, we have heard, still appear to harbor a sort of bitterness of spirit toward our people and institutions.--It is related that last evening a citizen who was talking with a squad from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> overheard the following <unclear>dialogue</unclear> between a tall, lank <placeName reg="Texan">Texan</placeName> and a short, stub-shot specimen from <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/> We have often remarked that land batteries, properly constructed, can never be silenced by vessels of any size, and that in the <rs n="General History" type="misc">general history</rs> of all warfare, with the exception of the present war, in which our batteries, with few exceptions, have been of the most miserable description, land fortifications have always proved too much for ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>But batteries can be passed without much danger by gunboats at full speed, and, to meet this contingency, vessels loaded with stone should be sunk in the channel, and, if necessary, iron clad piles be also driven in, surrounded by <foreign lang="fre">chevaux de frieze of treer,</foreign> which could be easily cut down from the neighboring shore, and so arranged as to give the enemy a tangled knot to untie before he could get at the obstructions in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>In addition to this, bomb proof batteries commanding the channel should be placed on the shore, and other batteries farther back, commanding any spot at which the enemy might attempt to land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>This, we are assured by high naval authority, is the proper and the only reliable mode of defending a river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>This is the confession of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves, and we are, therefore, warranted in believing that, with proper defences, armed with guns of this description, no steamers that the enemy can build can come up <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.
