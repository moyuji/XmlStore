<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>After expressing his regret that by the acceptance he shall have to retire from any further labors in behalf of <placeName reg="Mount Vernon, Knox, Ohio" key="tgn,2080902">Mount Vernon</placeName> be refers to the angry state of feeling in the country and the necessity for the revival of the kindly sentiments which once existed between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, as sufficient excuse to warrant his sacrificing his own inclinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>He thus proceeds: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> I suppose it to be the almost universal impression &mdash; it is certainly mine &mdash; that the existing state of affairs is extremely critical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Our political controversies have substantially as an died and almost purity sectional character &mdash; that of a fearful struggle between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It would not be difficult to show at length the perilous nature and tendency of this struggle, but I can only say, on this occasion, that, in my opinion, it cannot be much longer kept up, without rending the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I do not mean that either of the great parties in the country desires or aims at a separation of the <name>States</name> as a final object, although there are extremists in considerable numbers who have that object in view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> While a potent and a careful influence is exercised by men of this class, in both sections of the <rs>Union</rs> a portion of the conservative masses are insensibly and gradually goaded into concurrence with opinions and sentiments with which in the outset, they had no sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Meantime, almost wholly neglecting the main public interests, our political controversies turn more and more on questions, in reference to which as abstract fondness, the great sections of the country difference countably, though there is nothing practically important at stake, which requires the discussion to be kept up. These controversies are carried on with steadily increasing bitterness and exasperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The passions thus kindled have already led to acts of violence and bloodshed, approaching to civil war in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and attempted servile insurrection in the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The great religious and philanthropic association of the country are sundered, and the kindly social relations of <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> seriously impaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The national <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, hovering on the verge of anarchy, requires weeks to effect the organizations, which ought to be the work of an hour, and it house its sessions, (many of its members, I am told, armed with concealed weapons) on the crest of a volcano.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The candidates for the <name>Presidency</name> representing respectively the dominant sectional ideas, will, at the ensuing election, in all probability, be supporter by a purely geographical vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In other words, we are already brought to a pass, at which <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> cannot and will boy to operate in the periodical reorganization of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Can such a state of things long continue, especially with the ever-present risk of new causes of exasperation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I own that it seems to a impossible, unless some healing course is adopted, that the catastrophe, which the mass of good citizens so much deprecate, should be much longer delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A spirit of patriotic moderation must be called into action throughout in Union, or it will assuredly be broken up. Unless the warfare of inflammatory speeches and incendiary publications is abandoned, and good citizens, as in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, will agree to deal with the same elements of discord (for they existed then as now) as our fathers dealt with them, we shall but for a very few years longer be even nominally brethren of <num value="1">one</num> family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><hi rend="italics">The suggestion that the <rs>Union</rs> can be maintained by the numerical predominance and military profess of <num value="1">one</num> section exerted to coerce the other into submission, is in my judge at, as self contradictory as it is dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It comes invalid with the death smell from fields wet with brother's blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If the vital principle of all <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> governments is &#x0022;the concept of the governed&#x0022; much more does a union of conquest sovereign States require, as its basis, the forming of its members and their voluntary cooperate on in its organic functions.</hi> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Even in the hot blaze of that natural indignation which the wicked invasion of the <rs>South</rs> has caused, the <rs>South</rs> will do the <rs>North</rs> no such injustice as to suppose that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Everett,,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName></hi> is a fair specimen of her people.--There are some whose voices have not joined the rabble shout, nor bowed the knee to <hi rend="smallcaps">Baal;</hi> there are a few who boldly and manfully have spoken out for truth and justice; and even of the brutal multitude, wallowing in fierce passions, it cannot be said that they are inconsistent and hypocritical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> <hi rend="italics">My friends of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>,</hi> who have assembled here tonight, I greet you with the warmth of an overflowing heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Had not similar scenes on my way to this place, in demonstration of the interest of the <rs>Southern</rs> people in the cause in which I am engaged, accustomed me to them, this kind reception might have taken me by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I take it, however, as no compliment to myself personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I think I understand very well this demonstration and all other welcomes that have greeted me on my way hither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is but the expression of the profound earnestness of Southern men in the glorious cause in which we are all engaged, to which my energies are pledged, and in which my life, fortune and honor is forever enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>[Applause] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> I doubt not you want to hear something of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>[Voices &#x0022;Yes; tell us about her? &#x0022;] The troubles you have had here, the difficulties you have surmounted, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> has felt and encountered to a far greater extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> are more divided than the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The insidious influences of the enemy have for years been brought to bear on her in the effort to surround the <rs>South</rs> with a &#x0022;wall of fire,&#x0022; occupying as she does the position on the left flank of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>On account of the geographical situation of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, it is apparent to the mind of all that these States must be the great battle-fields upon which this war is to be waged, if <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> shall think proper to continue it. I had hoped, however, and I still have some hope, that after the terrible defeat and dreadful slaughter which his minions met with at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> the other day, he will look at the thing properly and be governed by reason in stead of fanaticism, and cease this war before the sun goes down to morrow night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>If he has been laboring under the delusion that he could conquer the <rs>Southern</rs> people, the battle which was fought the other day at <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName> ought to be satisfactory evidence to him that such a thing is utterly impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He ought to know that history presents no case where such a people as the <rs>Southern States</rs> contain, with such resources to back them, with such interests at stake, with such courage to nerve their arms and such principles to inspire their hearts, ever were conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>And all who, like <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, attempt the hazard us experiment, will learn from the book of bloody disaster that they never can be conquered [Continued cheering, and cries of &#x0022;Never!&#x0022; &#x0022;never!&#x0022;] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> I sympathize deeply with the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, as well as you do with the people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>As I before remarked, the geographical position of the <num value="2">two</num> States makes them the battle grounds by necessary consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>We are placed in the front ranks; we occupy the out posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>If these are taken it cannot be expected the citadel will long hold out. Hence, I have everywhere, from the time I entered the <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">State of Arkansas</placeName> until I reached this place, invoked my fellow-citizens to rally to the rescue; if they did not want to see their own homes in flames, their own firesides desolated, they must march forthwith, either to <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, meet the invader face to face, and drive him from the soil, or die in the noble endeavor.-- [Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> I know you desire to hear something specially about <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Well, we have had some little skirmishing there; we have no taste for standing off and looking on, and when we get close to the enemy, we are bound to make him smell our powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>We had a little skirmish at <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName>, where I had but <num value="600">six hundred</num> men, and half of them unequipped &mdash; the enemy having <num value="2700">twenty- seven hundred</num> well drilled soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Although it was un wise to make any stand against such overwhelming odds, my men could not resist the opportunity of taking a shot or <num value="2">two</num> before retreating &mdash; We lost <num value="3">three</num> men and they lost <num value="9">nine</num>, We continued on the retreat <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> or <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, with enemies all around me, with forces sent to intercept my road, communications with friends cut off, and reinforcements could not reach me in large bodies; my friends came to me in squads of fives, tens, fifties and hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>I knew they would come, and I awaited them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>At length I had a sufficient force to make a stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>On the <date value="07-05">5th of July </date> the enemy appeared, numbering <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> men, under command of Col <persName n="Siegel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Siegel,nomatch:0"><surname>Siegel</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>We routed them, drove them <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure>, and from every position they took, and the last we heard of them they were still running [Laughter and cheers] It was done exclusively by <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Another battle we had a day or <num value="2">two</num> afterwards, and I think it is the greatest fight of the war, although upon a small scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/><persName n="Cook,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Cook,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Cook</surname></persName> had raised a regiment of <num value="800">800</num> men, mostly <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>.

[Cheers] There has been some little skirmishing on the north side of the <placeName reg="Missouri River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014086">Missouri River</placeName>, of which, however, I can give no account, having seen nothing but telegraphic reports from that region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The day after the <date value="07-05">5th of July</date> battle, I was met by the gallant <rs>McCulloch</rs> &mdash;&mdash; <persName n="McCulloch,,Ben,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="default:McCulloch,Ben,,,"><foreName>Ben</foreName> <surname>McCulloch</surname></persName> &mdash; you all know him. [Cheers] That gallant soldier had marched for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> and nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He knew the enemy was after me. He was <measure n="15hours" type="date">fifteen hours</measure> too late, but it was not his fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I have been mortified, my fellow citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, to see it published in your papers that <sic>that</sic> gallant officer and myself had a difficulty after the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>My friends, if I had the power, and desired to make a man who should stand as the representative of manhood, and combine within himself all that is excellent in human character, I know not the model I would sooner take than the gallant, noble, brave <persName n="McCulloch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:McCulloch,Ben,,,"><surname>McCulloch</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>[Cheers.] With <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> men he came to our assistance, with troops from <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> regiment from this latter State was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and best I ever saw. They came all the way on foot, they came to fight and not to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>In addition to this force he brought to my aid his high military genius, his resistless energy and brave and fearless heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>[Cheers] <persName n="Polk,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="default:Polk,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> has ordered to my assistance <num value="13000">thirteen thousand</num> men, and they are now on their way to the battlefield [Cheers] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> I shall return as soon as the cars can take me to the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">State of Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>I shall go to the field, and there I shall remain until the invader is driven from our soil, or we are conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>[Cheers.] I do not expect the latter to take place, Such men as we have can never be conquered, [cheers.] because they are fighting for that which is dearer than life itself &mdash; their rights [Cheers.] I have left behind me wife, children, home, everything that is dear to man. My men are in the same condition.--We would be worse than cowards if we gave up the contest with anything less than life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> In the great battle lately fought &mdash; the battle of <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Eugene,,,:1"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> &mdash; our men exhibited a foretaste of what <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s menials may expect in every contest that is to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Any set of raw troops who can, with nothing but <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie knives</rs>, charge upon the bayonets of regulars, as our men did in the late battle, can never be whipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>There is no instance upon record where raw recruits were known to make such bold, daring, slashing charges right up to the mouths of cannon, manned by veterans, and take them, as did our men on that occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Nor was an army with such equipments and appointments, as the enemy possessed, ever before known to leave all their munitions in the hands of a force so numerically inferior as ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Let every man in the <rs>Southern States</rs> be of good cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>With all the divisions of my people and all the difficulties and embarrassments that have been thrown around me by the combined efforts of traitors and foe, I have never for <num value="1">one</num> moment doubted what is to be the final result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>[Applause] All we have to do, my friends of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, is to rise once and overpower the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Their troops have been <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> troops; their time is about expiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>You may take my word for it, very few of those men who have tested the strength of Southern steel will be anxious to re-enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>[Cheers.] Then I say, before they reorganize their shattered army, let us strike, and strike home--[Cheers.] I claim to have no superior military capacity, but to my mind the quick and decisive blow is the <num value="1">one</num> we should make in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and drive the invader from our soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>I advise every man in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, that can raise an arm in defence of his home and rights, to go to <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>What is life to me or to the <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> soldiers left behind <unclear/> Everything that makes life at all valuable, causes to exist unless we can be with those near and true to us, unless we are able to maintain our rights, vindicate our honor, and establish our independence. &#x0022;Give me liberty or give me death,&#x0022; is my motto in this contest.

<head>Newspapers and fault-finders.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> It is a good deal the fashion in these times to sneer at newspaper reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The fact that some of the statements made in every newspaper subsequently turn out to be inaccurate, or even absolutely unfounded, affords something of a pretext to those who deal in these wholesale denunciations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>People who deal in these flippant diatribes do not choose to recollect that, amongst the mass of daily intelligence from all sections, by newspapers, by telegraph, by letters, and orally, which every <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> journalists must examine and arrange, suppressing what is clearly scandalous, and rejecting what is palpably false or wholly improbable &mdash; a duty performed every <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>--nothing but infallibility can prevent journalists from falling sometimes to detect that which is false, and sometimes placing in print that which is inaccurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Especially, in times like these, when the whole atmosphere is hot with excitement, and the whole community is talking at random, the press would have to be endowed with Divine wisdom to preserve it from error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>It is at worst but a reflection of the public sentiment and intelligence &mdash; the mirror in which the community sees its own features &mdash; and if the image is not always what it should be, the fault may possibly be in the countenance that is reflected as much as in the <rs n="looking glass" type="product">looking-glass</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Moreover, as our able and patriotic contemporary, the <orgName n="Baltimore Exchange" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">Exchange</hi></orgName> justly remarks, no newspaper does or can be expected to vouch for the entire accuracy of every item that appears in its columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Its conductors have no power to summon their informants before them, and put them on oath, subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The most they are bound to do, is to sift as fairly and intelligently as they can the mass of matter before them, and conscientiously suppress what they honestly believe to be untrue in itself, or unjust to any individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>This duty they perform, as far as we know, about as honestly as the world at large discharges any of its obligations; and any man who reflects on the subject, will be forced to acknowledge that, considering the amount of information which journalists furnish to the public, it is more to be relied on than that circulated by any other class of people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>When they give currency to a statement, it is <num value="9">nine</num> times out of <num value="10">ten</num> substantially correct, because they have generally, as it is their business to do investigated the facts as soon as they heard them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>But of how many persons in the community can this be said?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Are there not, every day, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> absurd and libellous statements afloat throughout the community, and are not these repeated over and over again in the course of a morning by half the population?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Do not the very individuals who complain the most of the inaccuracies of the press, help to circulate, time and again, some falsehood or scandal, which they find is contradicted by the press the next day?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>If newspapers published indiscriminately all the reports which the rest of the community is continually engaged in discussing and giving currency to there would be more than cause enough for complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The real wonder is that so many of the multitudinous items of information in a daily journal should be as correct as they are. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> But neither for these, nor for anything else that is good, do the croakers, grumblers and fault-finders give credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>With all the shortcomings of the newspapers, they are the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to grab them in the morning and the loudest in cursing the carriers if they are not received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>We sometimes wish that the press could be entirely abolished for a time, just to see the eclipse that would come over some people, and over the reputation of others, how owe all their notoriety to newspapers, but for whose excessive good nature not more than a score or <num value="2">two</num> of men in this country would be known out of their own balliwick. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>We intended to move about <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, and they commenced their attack before our movement could be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> waited patiently upon the knoll which I have designated; but the same cannot be said of your humble servant or the other gentlemen around about &mdash; until finally the rattle of musketry upon our extreme left betokened that &#x0022;somebody was getting hurt.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> To understand the battle, you must know that our line was faced towards <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and immediately back of it, defending the various fords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>By turning our flank, the line of battle was changed to a direction perpendicular to the <num value="1">one</num> which we had assumed, and commencing at our left extended back for a mile and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>When the musketry betrayed the &#x0022;cat in the meal tub,&#x0022; away went the <rs>Generals</rs> and their Staff, flying upon the wings of the wind to reach the scene of action, distant fully <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>. The country was a rolling <num value="1">one</num>, thickly interspersed with pine thickets, and the battle ground was an open valley with a hill upon each side, rising some <measure n="100feet" type="distance">100 feet</measure> above the low ground, and distant from each other about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">600 yards</measure>. The struggle was an alternate movement of regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>When the head of <orgName n="column"><persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>'s column</orgName> reached <placeName reg="Sudley, Anne Arundel, Maryland" key="tgn,2700708">Sudley</placeName>'s spring, (a ford much higher up than it was anticipated they would cross, as the <rs type="place">Stone Bridge</rs> was the point we were defending upon the extreme left,) quietly they sneaked along, getting in behind us, until discovered, I believe, by <orgName n="Brigade"><persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="nearbymention:Evans,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>' Brigade</orgName>, who opened fire upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Then, in quick succession, the enemy's regiments deployed in line to their right, whilst ours came up upon our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>The engagement grew hot and heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Their column numbered <num value="25000">25,000</num>, whilst we could only oppose them at the beginning with about <num value="8000">8,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Slowly but surely the heavy column kept on in its march, pressing our line back by the weight of numbers, and moving on in the settled purpose of turning our flank and attacking us in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Gallantly however, did our army struggle for the right, and despite of odds, regiment after regiment threw itself in the way, disputing the ground, inch by inch, regardless of the fact that its predecessors had been cut to pieces or dispersed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>A battery harassing our lines, the <orgName type="regiment" key="8GARegiment">8th Georgia Regiment</orgName> was ordered to take it, and right well did they do so; but a myriad of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> seemed to rise up, who had been hitherto concealed, and pouring in their fire upon our column, it seemed to melt away like snow beneath a summer's sun. <persName n="Gardner,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00379" reg="nearbymention:Gardner,Montgomery,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName> was here shot down and was taken prisoner, but afterwards retaken by our men later in the day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> The <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>, compelled to retreat with nearly half its number wounded or killed, the attack of the enemy was met by the <name>Brigade</name> of <persName n="Bee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="mostcommon:Bee,Barnard,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bee</surname></persName>, composed of Mississippians and Alabamians, and <num value="1">one</num> regiment, I think, of Tennesseans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Later in the day, <persName n="Bartow,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00381" reg="mostcommon:Bartow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Bartow</surname></persName> was shot near this spot, whilst leading on the <orgName type="regiment" key="7GARegiment">7th Georgia Regiment</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Gartrell,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="mostcommon:Gartrell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gartrell</surname></persName> <orgName n="Brigade"><persName n="Bee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="mostcommon:Bee,Barnard,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bee</surname></persName>'s Brigade</orgName> could not withstand the fierce tornado of shot and shell sweeping through its ranks, and slowly retired, fighting bravely all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="4ALRegiment">4th Alabama Regiment</orgName> suffered terribly, all of its field officers being shot down, and <num value="2">two</num> (<persName n="Jones,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00384" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scott,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00385" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>) left upon the field. --<persName n="Jones,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00386" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> was captured, but afterwards retaken during the rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Falling back upon the position taken by <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s Legion, whose prowess can clearly be shown by the heaps of dead in front of their line, a momentary check was thrown in the enemy's approach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> They had now retreated to the brow of the hill, where the <orgName>brigade of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00387" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,J.,G.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName></orgName> was lying <hi rend="italics">perdu,</hi> and this was the most critical point of the day. Fighting for hours under a not sun, without a drop of water near, the conduct of our men could not be excelled; but human endurance has its bounds, and all seemed about to be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Our reserves were yet miles distant from the scene of action, whilst the enemy's reserve kept pressing on. From the knoll near the <rs type="place">Lewis House</rs>, the <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> had remained anxious spectators of the conflict; but the time had come for action, and plunging their spurs into the quick-foote steeds, away went the <rs>Generals</rs> and their staff right into the thickest of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Coming up <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the <name>Alabamians</name>, who were without a field <persName n="Johnston,Officer-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00388" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Officer-General">officer Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> placed the color-bearer by his horse's side and moved on &mdash; each and all of the staff, with the <rs>Generals</rs>, vising with each other in words of encouragement to the men to come on.--And well timed was this movement.--Already our line upon the hill top was giving way, but incited to fresh deeds of heroism by the appearance in their midst of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, apparently bringing up reinforcements, they pitched into the fray with redoubled ardor, and from that time we yielded not an inch of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00389" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> riding over to the left took charge of operations there, displaying his reckless bravery by riding everywhere in the face of the enemy's fire, and having his horse killed beneath him, fortunately escaping uninjured himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>The tide of battle thus checked, away went <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00390" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s staff, to hurry up the reserves and assign them to proper positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> were met <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> back, covered with dust and coming at a double quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>Never were assembled on this side of the globe <num value="2">two</num> such hostile forces, and never has the <rs>Republic</rs> met with a reverse to its arms so dispiriting in its effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Not that the rebel commander, if he had been enterprising and bold enough to pursue his advantage, might have made it much more disastrous and demoralizing to our forces, but the disappointment which follows from the repulse of an army which had gone forth so confidently to victory, has a most depressing and stunning effect upon the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>It seems scarcely to be realized that an army so carefully prepared, so numerous, so well appointed, and so spirited, could march on to anything but victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>And victory, too, seemed almost secured &mdash; already within grasp, when a movement &mdash; an accident it may be &mdash; wrested it from our troops, and turned the well-earned laurels of our troops into worthless weeds, and compelled them to leave the field to their almost beaten foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/> It is said that the panic which seized the troops was communicated by a sudden flight of teamsters and civilians, members of Congress, and others, out as spectators of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>This may have helped the panic, but the real cause is probably deeper than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Our army has been hastily formed, and men are in high position as officers who have never seen service of any kind, raw as their troops, and almost as inexperienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Such officers have not the confidence of their men, and have not the qualities in themselves to secure it. The men lacking confidence in the ability of their officers, fight under disadvantage, for they know not what trap they may be running into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>While exhibiting the highest daring and courage, a trifle may strike them with panic, and panic is demoralization to the whole army for the time being, and certain defeat. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>They have been preparing for many months for this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>They have an abundance of small arms, immense amount of cannon; their troops at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> amounted to <num value="90000">90,000</num> men, with the railroad trains in their rear continually at work pouring in fresh troops during the whole progress of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>They therefore outnumbered nearly <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num> (!!) the <rs>Federal</rs> force, chose their own ground, and had every foot of it that our army was expected to pass over, strongly fortified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>As their courage, it must be remembered that they are of our own race, not physically perhaps as strong, but equally intelligent, and what is of greater importance, longer under training to give firmness to their courage and assurance to their skill, besides being officered with some of the best military talent in the army and navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>With such a foe as this, it is not advisable to rush on without adequate preparation, and without a force equal to any emergency required Ignorant presumption may cry out impatiently, &#x0022;On to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>!&#x0022; but there must be means at hand greater than the resistance, or the pathway to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> will be lined with the graves of our soldiers.
