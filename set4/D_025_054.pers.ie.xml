<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Some <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago a party of seamen, armed to the teeth and accompanied by <num value="4">four</num> splendid boats, left the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,2043852" n="0.205 000000.8181	placename;tgn,7013964;richmond, richmond, virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2043852;richmond, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;richmond, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America">Richmond</placeName> on the <placeName reg="Mechanicville, Terrebonne, Louisiana" key="tgn,2504620">Mechanicville</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Their destination was a matter of conjecture, and more than <num value="1">one</num> anxious <hi rend="italics">quidnunc</hi> puzzled his brain over the problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The quickened imagination of a curious man soon works out a troublesome secret, and before half the day had elapsed I was regaled with a dozen different accounts, each of them undoubtedly correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It may seem singular that when the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> gave me orders to join the party he did not take me into his confidence, and I was therefore as ignorant about the matter as about the plans of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>I must confess, then, to a certain amount of interest in the stories confidentially whispered into my buttonhole, and I listened attentively to the recital of disasters about to befall me, and saw work marked out that would occupy several months, and finally consign me to Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> or to &mdash; somewhere else. --It was a cheerful prospect &mdash; but beyond a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>My orders came late in the day, when I was on liberty in the city, enjoying the luxury of leisure and white linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I was to start at daylight in the morning, but, owing to the difficulty of obtaining a passport from the courteous officers of that delectable office on <address><street n="9 Street">9th st</street></address>., I was delayed until meridian the following day. My command was then some <measure n="18hours" type="date">eighteen hours</measure> ahead of me, and I had to overtake them upon as sorry a piece of horseflesh as <num value="1">one</num> could well imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>That animal was nearly the death of me: he was somewhat <hi rend="italics">rough</hi> and shook me until every joint in my body was loose and my teeth rattled in their sockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Complaining did no good, and I determined to let no trials ruffle my good nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>By careful inquiry along the road I was enabled to trace the party across the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>, the <rs>Mattaponi</rs> at <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, on through <placeName reg="Essex, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008131">Essex</placeName>, half-way through the adjoining county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Towards evening of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day I was fortunate enough to strike the trail, and in <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> after reached the end of my equestrian journey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> That night we bivouacked on the <name>Paintbank</name>, some <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> from its month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The boats were in the water in readiness for sailing, while the men, secreted between <num value="2">two</num> hills, lounged about upon the grass, or cooked their rations by the bivouac fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><persName n="Wood,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Wood,Matthew,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, the commander of the party, was off on a reconnaissance, and did not return until the following evening, at which time immediate preparations for departure were begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We knew then, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, that our object was to capture <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> blockaders by boarding her in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>At <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> the men were called to quarters, arms inspected, and ammunition distributed, and, after prayer by <persName n="Wood,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Wood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, the boats were manned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The crews were in fine spirits, and with muffled oars rowed rapidly and silently down the stream, sending out no noise save the rippling of the waves around the cutters' bows as they ploughed their way through the water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> About <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> the mouth of the river was reached, and the boats were halted for an hour to rest the men and issue instructions for the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Towards midnight we were again in motion, pulling cautiously towards the spot where the gunboats usually lay. It was a warm, quiet, starlight evening, with hardly a breath of wind afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Upon reaching the mooring ground the steamer was nowhere to be seen, and no trace of her was visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>As we were searching for her, however, a signal light some mile or so away showed us her position, and soon afterwards the sound of machinery told us she was in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This was contrary to her usual custom, and seemed evidence that our coming had been made known by spies and traitors on the shore; and, as it was impossible to board her while under way, nothing remained but for us to return and wait a more favorable opportunity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Turning up the river, keeping out of sight under the wooded banks, we pulled some <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> and entered the mouth of a <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> with high shores on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Here the boats were secreted, and men and officers, thoroughly exhausted, threw themselves down on the ground to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Daylight soon came, and with it the sound of an approaching steamer, making her way directly towards us. From this <persName n="Wood,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Wood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> naturally supposed we had been seen, and that the steamer was in pursuit of us. His plan of battle was quickly formed, and was an excellent <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Sending the boats high up the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> for protection, he ordered <persName n="Hoge,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hoge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName>, with the main body of men, to follow them on land, keeping about a dozen men with him at the mouth of the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, if in pursuit of us, would undoubtedly follow the boats, and we could thus get them between <num value="2">two</num> fires and possibly cut off their retreat.--Upon reaching the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> the steamer came to anchor and sent ashore <num value="5">five</num> boats, containing some <num value="80">eighty</num> men. Our men lay ambushed in a small coppice, some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6yards" type="distance">six yards</measure> from the water; but, unfortunately, just as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> boat came abreast of them, <num value="1">one</num> of them incautiously exposed himself and drew the attention of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They immediately fired upon him, shouting from boat to <term type="ship">boat</term>, <rs type="ship">Shoot him--kill him--don't let the d--d rebel get away,</rs> firing their rifles rapidly and at random.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot <persName n="Wood,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Wood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, with all his coolness, was unable to restrain the men. They were bound to fire, and immediately poured a volley into the boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This produced a great consternation, and all that were able pulled away as rapidly as possible &mdash; not waiting to load their muskets after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The foremost boat was now aground, and to this our men turned their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> dropped into the bottom of the boat, and the <rs>Captain</rs>, the only brave man in the party, shouted, and cursed to make them point their cars and shove off. <num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the men were wounded before this could be accomplished, and just as the boat got out into the stream the <rs>Captain</rs> also received a fatal shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At the sometime the flag was shot down, but <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> was instantly replaced upon a shorter staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The steamer also commenced shelling the woods, and the fire was kept up until the boats were in, when she, too, hastily retreated down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>From the <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName>, of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num>, received since, we learned that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, <persName n="Hotchkiss,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Hotchkiss,nomatch:0"><surname>Hotchkiss</surname></persName>, was killed, and several of the men wounded &#x0022;by guerillas.&#x0022; We have ascertained also that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were ignorant of our presence, and came up the river to destroy the house of <persName n="Jones,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, now a prisoner in the Old Capitol prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>On the way up, early in the morning, they had desolated the home of <persName n="Hutchins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hutchins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hutchins</surname></persName>, carrying off everything possible, and shooting his stock in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> That evening we pulled up to our original starting point, and by dark had the boats again out of the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>When the wagons came they were put upon them, and we started across the country for a new scene of operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Worn out by hard marching and severe labor, it was necessary to give the men a day of rest, and it was not until the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> that we reached the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The boats were again launched in Meachum's <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, just inside of <placeName key="possibilities=12" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Gray's Point</placeName>, and about <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> from the <rs>Chesapeake</rs></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Just at the mouth of the river is a small bay or cove, called <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s Hole, in which the blockaders usually run at night for a safe anchorage.--The river is some <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Upon the opposite side is <placeName reg="Stingray Point, Indian River, Florida" key="tgn,2695486">Stingray Point</placeName>, from which the land runs down into <placeName reg="Mobjack Bay, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1113456">Mobjack bay</placeName> and the mouth of the <name>Paintbank</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> sets of blockaders here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Off the mouth of the latter mentioned river the steamers belong to the &#x0022;<orgName n="North Atlantic Squadron" type="squadron">North Atlantic Squadron</orgName>, &#x0022; while at the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> they are from the &#x0022;Potomac Flotilla.&#x0022; They communicate with each other, however, and are near enough to signal at night with <rs type="color">blue</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs> lights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>At this time <num value="3">three</num> steamers were off the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> &mdash; the <rs>Currituck</rs>, the <rs>Reliance</rs>, and the <rs>Satellite</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/><num value="1">One</num> or all of these we were determined to have. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> It was about <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> in the evening of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> when the boats were again manned, and started down the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.--The sun was just setting as we entered the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and at dark we were running under the dim shadow of the wooded shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It was a beautiful night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The land loomed up in the dark, the river ran calm and placid to the bay, the stars shone in the sky, and in the <rs>East</rs> brighter than all hung the crescent moon.--Added to the picture was a line of black boats, filled with armed men, creeping <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs>-like over the water, prepared to spring upon the foe whenever he came in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Late in the night <persName n="Wood,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Wood,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> called the boats alongside his own and gave instructions for the attack; then, after a fervent prayer, we pushed out into the bay. From pickets on the point we learned the steamers lay some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> out towards <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s Hole, but after a careful search they were not to be found, and we were forced to return without accomplishing anything. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> It was daybreak when we entered Meachum's <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, and in half an hour after the boats were moored in their former hiding-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The next night we tried it, but with no better success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, the next day, we remained inactive, but <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> resolved to try again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> It was late in the night when we hauled out into the stream, and once more ran down towards the bay. It was just such an evening as before, but there were signs of an approaching storm.
