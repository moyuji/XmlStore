<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> A day or <num value="2">two</num> ago the <orgName n="Evening Post" type="newspaper">Evening Post</orgName> called attention to the fact that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> applications for clearances to <placeName reg="Matamoras, Blackford, Indiana" key="tgn,2496268">Matamoras</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, made at the custom-house for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> past have been within a week; and, also, that the convenient town of <placeName reg="Brownsville, Cameron, Texas" key="tgn,7013459">Brownsville, Texas</placeName>, a little distance from <placeName reg="Matamoras, Blackford, Indiana" key="tgn,2496268">Matamoras</placeName>, on the other side of the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, is quite as good a port as <placeName reg="Matamoras, Blackford, Indiana" key="tgn,2496268">Matamoras</placeName>, with the known advantage of being near the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, and the probable <num value="1">one</num> of being the port for which the shipments are intended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> A reference to our shipping list to day will show that the <rs>William R. Kibbe</rs>, whose name is familiar in connection with the recent history of the slave trade, has just cleared for <placeName reg="Matamoras, Blackford, Indiana" key="tgn,2496268">Matamoras</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>She sailed to-day under the <rs>British</rs> flag, with a cargo valued at from <num value="20000">twenty</num> to <measure n="30000dollars" type="currency">thirty thousand dollars</measure>, and consisting of clothing, flour, provisions, coffee, potatoes, and a general list of articles which may be needed at <placeName reg="Matamoras, Blackford, Indiana" key="tgn,2496268">Matamoras</placeName>, but which are actually wanted in the seceded States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The <rs type="place">Port Surveyor</rs> the <name>Naval</name> officer have been watching the <name>Kibbe</name> for a week past, and as in the case of all suspected vessels, have refused to clear her without special instructions from the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The special instructions have been received, allowing the <name>Kibbe</name> to clear, and she has done so. It is not improbable that the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName> has thus authorized the shipment of valuable cargo of provisions and clothing, which is intended to afford at least <measure n="30000dollars" type="currency">$30,000</measure> worth of aid and comfort to the <rs>Confederates</rs>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> The delays and the inconveniences in the opening and the delivery of the mails at the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post- office</orgName> in this city are without precedent in any <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> that we have ever seen or heard of. These matters of complaint are not attributable to any want of the spirit of accommodation or industry in the <rs>Postmaster</rs> or his assistants and clerks; but to a want of sufficient force to perform the work of the office; and to some necessary improvement in the arrangement of the general delivery department. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> Owing to the want of sufficient force, the most important mails are not opened and delivered until the day after their arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> who have relatives and friends in the armies of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and those of the <rs>West</rs> and the <rs>Northwest</rs>, are anxious to hear from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>But the mail that comes at <time value="8pm">8 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> The general delivery system, which was ample at the time it was established, is altogether unsuited to the present increased business of the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The crowd upon the opening of the office is oppressive, and the time that many have to wait before they can reach the delivery aperture is exceedingly trying to the patience of the most patient of men. The number of places of delivery should be multiplied and alphabetically arranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>This would at once, with an increase of force, remedy this serious evil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> The business community of this city is not very much concerned by this last named subject of complains, as they are supplied from the private boxes, which are abundant, and admirably arranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>All the press can doors to speak of them and represent them in their true light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> The perils of the battle-field to armies are literally nothing in comparison with those of disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It is not more essential that military movements should be guided and controlled by the highest order of genius than it is that the daily life of the camp and the hospital service should be directed and regulated by the highest intelligence, experience and system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>It is not more important that the minutest details of discipline and drill should be enforced upon the soldier, than that the minutest detail of everything which affects his health or tends to his restoration when sick, should be diligently observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/><placeName reg="Bethel, Oxford, Maine" key="tgn,2044460">Bethel</placeName>, <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Springfield, Sangamon, Illinois" key="tgn,7014529">Springfield</placeName> have proved that, in military skill and fighting qualities, our Southern army is ahead of any other on this continent, but we have a more dangerous enemy than bayonets and bullets to contend with, in disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Although the enemy suffers as much in this respect as we do, and probably more, yet a thorough attention to details in the methods of providing for the sick may tend to lesson greatly his losses from this cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> We have before called attention to the fact that, where such a disease as measles is prevalent, great care should be taken to quarter fresh troops, who have just arrived, heated and exhausted after a long march, and sometimes perhaps in a pelting rain, in dry and comfortable quarters, such as are afforded by some of the large and numerous tobacco factories and public buildings, which may be found in our own and other cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>To march men in such a condition to a wet camp would be as reckless and destructive to human life as to order an unarmed regiment to storm <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Of course, to march patients suffering from measles or any other disease from a railroad station to a hospital, through a driving rain, instead of conveying them in the easiest carriages, and most perfectly protected from the weather, that can be found, would prove almost certain death to the victims of such treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Measles is a comparatively innocent disease when the patient is not exposed to cold; but, when thus exposed, dangerous in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Another rule that ought to be uniformly observed, is to keep patients who are suffering from contagious diseases in rooms or wards by themselves, and carefully isolated from those whose diseases are not of that character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Nor should any encampment of healthy soldiery be ever posted in the neighborhood of a hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It is also desirable that, as soon as the men in a hospital become convalescent, the fact should be made known to citizens who are willing to receive them into their houses &mdash; and everybody is willing &mdash; and they should be at once removed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>We are sure that numerous defects and causes of complaint must be found in the beginning of great military operations in a country and among a generation wholly unused to war, and we refer to this subject in no fault-finding mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We know that a vast deal has been accomplished in those branches of the service which are responsible for the health and comfort of the soldiers; more, perhaps, than could have been reasonably expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>But there is abundant room for improvement yet, and we have no intention of losing sight of the subject till we have attained perfection as nearly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>There is no lack of officers charged with these duties, and the co-operation of the public with them, in every way and to any extent that may be required, is a thing they may calculate upon as surely as the rising of to-morrow's sun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/> A correspondent of the <rs>Portsmouth Transcript</rs> writes from <placeName reg="Camp Grimes">Camp Grimes</placeName>, <date value="08-31"> August 31st,</date> as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/> We were much surprized yesterday to see the little <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Harmony</rs> steaming past out post, bound up <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>She was guilty dreaded with <unclear></unclear> and appeared to be quite crowded with persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The most prominent feature aboard, however, was a large gun, mounted on a high carriage, and poking his head candidly over the how of the steamer.--Numerous were the opinions expressed as to the object of her mission, and we were startlingly a maned to see her pass such an <hi rend="italics">effective</hi> blockade as Old Abe has been pleased to establish at <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>We fully expected <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> every moment to witness a shot from the <rs>Savannah</rs>, but, to our astonishment, as soon as the <name>Harmony</name> had gotten about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> on the other side of the blockade, she belched forth a hearty <q>&#x0022;good morning&#x0022;</q> from her gallant war-dog to those on board the <rs type="ship">Savannah</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> did not reply to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> salutation, so the <name>Harmony</name> got mad and fired again, which drew a shot from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The engagement now became general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The crew of the H. appeared to be very cool and unexcited, while the <rs>Savannah</rs> seemed to be so mad that she tried to tear herself to pieces by firing broadsides at our steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>All of her firing proved of no avail, and the shots which were fired from the enemy's battery at <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> shared the same fate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>There were crowds of spectators on our shore, composed of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> soldiers, besides ourselves, and numerous were the hisses given as the shots of the enemy fell far short of our gallant little steamer, while long and loud were the shouts as each of our missiles fell near the ship of the heartless invaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> Several of the <rs>Harmony</rs>'s shots were not seen to fall and we are forced to the conclusion that they struck the ship. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/> In coming back, our steamer appeared to run so close to the enemy that we greatly feared for her safety, but were glad to see her ride defiantly by a force so much her superior in strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>We gave her a salute expressive of admiration, as she rode gallantly past our battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Surely such a daring exploit should gain the admiration of every true <persName><foreName>Southerner</foreName></persName> . </p> </div4>
