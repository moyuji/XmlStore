<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The earnest addresses of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Wyatt,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to the soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, in the present period of importance in the summer campaign, are entitled to the serious consideration of not only the soldiers, but the people generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>That our cause is anything but desponding, every <num value="1">one</num> who <unclear></unclear> estimates the situation of the country must feel convinced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Yet to defend ourselves and repel the invasion with proper energy and effect, it is necessary that every soldier should be at his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The feeling of fatigue and desire to spend a little while at home have no doubt induced some brave fellows to take advantage of some little scratch or ache to absent themselves, under the impression that they could be spared without detriment to the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>it only needs enough men deluded by this argument to subject the army to a draft upon its force very disadvantageous, to say the least independent of good fellows who are thus misled, there are some who are arrant skulkers &mdash; those craven-hearted and indolent fellows who are stragglers from the field merely to avoid duty and danger, and who, once in hospitals, become naturally &#x0022;hospital rats,&#x0022; whom it is almost impossible to dislodge from their holes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Now, those soldiers who are absent from duty under mistaken ideas, and whose intentions are the best, should not pause <num value="1">one</num> moment after they read the addresses of the <rs>President</rs> and the great commander of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They should at once vindicate themselves from suspicion of association with those others who skulk from duty for motives that are disgraceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Not a moment should they remain where they are liable to the most mortifying imputations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There are vast numbers of such, we are satisfied; and the only satisfactory proof they can afford of their true character is by promptly responding to the appeals made to their loyalty and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The addresses made to them are indeed appeals of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is only to those who are deaf to all sense of honor that threats of military rigor are directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>These last cannot escape, and should not be permitted to escapes the consequences of their desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The people should give them neither countenance nor support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They should no lodge them nor feed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A soldier who is able to fight has now no business at home, and this every man should know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>When <num value="1">one</num> of this kind presents himself he should be treated as <num value="1">one</num> recreant to his duty and to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The people &mdash; the men and women of the country &mdash; should frown upon them, and make every place but the camp unendurable to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The country is not in imminent peril, but it is perseveringly pressed by a merciless and brutal foe, from whom nothing but complete spoliation of everything we have, and the most abject humiliation of us all, can be expected should he finally overrun the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>To meet such a foe, and avert such consequences of his triumph, every man should be at his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They may not all the needed; but we should make assurance doubly sure by having all present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>That renewed and desperate efforts are to be made to take this city there cannot be a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We have but to continue faithful to our well earned fame for alacrity to meet the enemy and for the impetuosity and fearlessness with which we have fought him in the fields made glorious for the <rs>South</rs>, to drive him yet again from our soil, and for a while at least to be relieved from his hated presence. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>There is in his State a party not large, it is true, but countenanced and encouraged by a treacherous press, characterized by ingenuity and energy, which has by side winds and cunning assaults on special measures of the <rs>Government</rs> endeavored to throw obstacles in the way of recruiting the army and of the ordinary administration of public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The bad principles and bad motives of this press have possibly exerted some evil influences; but, we are sure, to a very limited extent.

He is worthy of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>His State has sent her sons to every battle field, where they have won undying fame for their good old mother, and he has upheld the authority and the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> with a firmness and consistency that challenges our admiration and commands the generous confidence of the nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Under the chief magistracy of <persName n="Vance,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Vance,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Vance</surname></persName>, the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">State of North Carolina</placeName> has given renewed assurance of faithfulness to the common cause, and moreover has afforded proofs of wisdom in the administration of public affairs that will assist in maintaining the good name and credit of the community of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The old State occupies a position on the map that gives her especial importance in the crisis, and it is, therefore, all the more gratifying that she maintains her ancient renown for bravery, honor, and true loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>She will never prove unfaithful to her confederates in the day of trial, and may be always relied on in every exigency which demands the exhibition of the virtues of manhood and constancy. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The operator on shore exploded the torpedo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The explosion, which was terrific, took place a few seconds too soon and before the foremost boat had gotten her how over the deadly engine, which, had it been beneath her, would have scattered her into atoms.--The water was thrown up from the bed of the river to a height of <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure>, lifting the how of the approaching steamer high in the air, and tearing from it quantities of planking and gearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In falling the great mass of the water fell on the vessel, tearing open her upper works and doing further damage.
