<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Myself and about <num value="18">eighteen</num> of the crew were put into the whale boat belonging to the <rs>Underwriter</rs>, and also a guard; the boat's painter was fast to the vessel, and the rebels then fired her fore and afterin the hold, and we all shoved off for <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName>, as we supposed, or to rebeldom somewhere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> Our boat was so crowded that we could not keep, up with the rest of the rebels, and we sometimes headed <num value="1">one</num> way and sometimes the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The guard aft, sitting directly behind me, hailed the other boats to come to his assistance and take off some of the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>There were but <num value="2">two</num> men guarding <num value="18">eighteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Before this I supposed some of the rebels were at every thwart, but at this news to me I snatched the cutlass from the guard's belt and gave it across overboard, at the same time saying he was my prisoner, and singing out to the men to give way with a will, which they did. I steered her ashore, and took my prisoner to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the works; got an ambulance and had <num value="1">one</num> of my men carried to the general hospital; he had a revolver shot in his knee joint; <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> others were more or less wounded, but none seriously. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Some <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> of our men swam ashore, some jumping out of our boat when she fell astern of the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The other guard was either killed and dumped overboard, or else jumped to save himself from being carried ashore as a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>We were favored by fortune immensely, for which we all were truly thankful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I escaped any hurts excepts being knocked down the companion way by a clubbed musket, as they drove us down into the ward-room, where we were followed with revolvers, sabres, <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie knives</rs>, &#x0026;c. </p>

<head>The army of exempts.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> The measure passed by Congress for the organization of an army of exempts is <num value="1">one</num> which, if prudently and efficiently carried out, will be of great service in the struggle in which we are now engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It should not be so administered as materially to interfere with the productive labor of the country, while it should insure a thorough organization of a reserve force whose services in the hour of trial and exigency would be timely and valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The raids and surprises of localities achieved by the enemy, which have been so disastrous in the destruction of the necessaries of life, demand that the country should be armed and disciplined everywhere; that every man should be a soldier even when at home, and ready at a moment's warning to rush to the defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>This is the spirit that should actuate us all; and when it does so, we shall have begun to resist in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The enemy will then find that the war has just begun, and that so far from subjugating the <rs>South</rs> he has not advanced a step towards it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> The army of exempts can do a great many things to avoid the necessity of withdrawing conscripts from the field, and thus be enabled, though they remain at home, to strengthen the ranks of the brave Southern armies which are resisting the invading columns of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The measure which calls them to this service has been passed because the country needed it. They certainly have by this time become convinced of the reality that the country is threatened with a fate the saddest that ever befell a nation, and which is only to be avoided by the united and determined resistance by the entire people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>This idea is taking possession of the <rs>Southern</rs> mind, and stimulated by the bold and energetic measures of Congress we shall see how a nation under the greatest disadvantages can, under a sense of right and justice, rise in its might and majesty and overwhelm a brutal and merciless enemy striving to conquer it and deprive it of everything it holds dear on earth. </p> </div3>

<head>Dry Eatings.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> In what way the day of Lent is to be kept this year in order to distinguish it from other seasons of the year, might puzzle a Carthusian monk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Under the dietetic laws of that order, the brethren were not to eat meat at any time, and during Lent they were prohibited the use of eggs, milk, butter and cheese.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Dry bread with water was their Lenten fare, but dry bread and water have been the daily food of some salaried officials in this city all the year round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>This is not the result of any scarcity of the fruits of the earth, but of the disordered currency, for there is no article of food or clothing which cannot be purchased at pretty much old prices for gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>But whatever the cause, the &#x0022;Dry Eatings&#x0022; are an established institution, and Lent, instead of <num value="40">forty</num>, lasts <measure n="365days" type="date">three hundred and sixty-five days</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> As misery loves company, it may be consolatory to those who are keeping Lent by compulsion to recall the austerities of the table which some ascetic persons have voluntarily endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>We find a number of edifying instances collected to our hand in a chapter before us on the &#x0022;Diet of Saints.&#x0022; It is recorded of St. Macarius that for years together he lived only on raw herbs and pulse; that during <num value="3">three</num> consecutive years he existed on <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> ounces of bread daily, and that he consumed but <num value="1">one</num> small measure of oil in a <num value="12">twelve</num> month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>At Lent he distinguished himself by eating nothing at all on the week days, and a few raw cabbage leaves on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>St. Macarius ought to have lived in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He would have learned a lesson of humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Cabbage heads there are in abundance, but cabbage leaves on Sunday or any other day is a piece of extravagant sensuality which neither saints nor sinners, in any great number, indulge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> <placeName key="tgn,7014540" n="1.000 3" reg="sainte genevieve, sainte genevieve, missouri">St. Genevieve</placeName> was another dry eater, for she only ate twice in the week, and then only beans and bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>St. Cedd, <rs type="role2">Bishop</rs> in old times of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, never broke his fast till evening, and then only ate a solitary egg, an inch of bread, and a cup of milk and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/><persName n="Walston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Walston,nomatch:0"><surname>Walston</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Bishop">Bishop</rs> of <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName>, had a strong relish for savory viands, but it is told of him that he was <num value="1">one</num> day during mass so distracted by the smell of meat roasting in a kitchen near the church that he made a vow to abstain from meat forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>A worthy example!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>We advise the general adoption of a similar vow, to last during the war. Those who make it are likely to keep it, which is the best part of a vow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> St. Publius did not allow his monks wine, milk, cheese, grapes, or even vinegar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Pulse and herbs, coarse bread and water, were their only fare, except during the period from <persName n="Easter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Easter,nomatch:0"><surname>Easter</surname></persName> to Whitsuntide, when they were permitted to grow merry over a gill of oil apiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/><placeName reg="Saint Martin" key="tgn,7004782">St. Martin</placeName> lived on herbs boiled with a little vinegar for seasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> Winwaloe, a Welch saint, kept his monks at starving point all the week, refreshing them on <date value="--7">Sundays</date> by microscopic rations of hard cheese and shell fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>He lived himself on barley bread, strewn with ashes, and when Lent arrived the quantity of ashes was doubled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> Innumerable examples might be multiplied, of a similar character, to stimulate our abstemious Richmonders in that Lenten austerity of life which is preached to them from the butcher and vegetable stalls of the city markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Not many of them are likely to come to such short commons as &#x0022;Diet of Saints,&#x0022; and it is some consolation to reflect that the majority have not yet felt the war. We have heard of no case of starvation as yet, which we attribute to the fact that those who have plenty eat enough for themselves and all the rest of the community. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
