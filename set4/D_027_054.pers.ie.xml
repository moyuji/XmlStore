<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> purpose for which the <name>States</name> can be called into convention &mdash; that of amending the <rs>Confederate Constitution</rs>; and the manner in which the convocation is to be made is described by the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It no where grants any power to convoke a <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">convention of the States</orgName> to any agency whatever for any other purpose than that alluded to. The <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> is perfectly right in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are so many sovereignties, each a nation in itself, with all the claims and attributes of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>This is the doctrine we went out of the <rs>Union</rs> proclaiming; the doctrine for the maintenance of which we have been fighting for the last <measure n="3.5years" type="date">three years and a half</measure>; the doctrine which distinguishes us from our enemies of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States; and which, if we surrender, we give up all we have been contending for. Being independent nations, they have united in a partnership for certain specified purposes, and have appointed an agent or attorney to carry those purposes into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>That agent or attorney is known as the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Its power of attorney is the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and it cannot transcend the limits conferred by that instrument any more than an attorney of flesh and blood can go beyond the limits of the paper by which he is created such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Now, what right has such an agency as this to put any <num value="1">one</num> of the independent nations from whom it holds its power into the proposed convention, or any other sort of convention, not authorized expressly by the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>If there be any power to put these States into a convention of any sort, why not put them into a convention with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, which is no more a foreign power than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> The Constitution confers upon the <rs>President</rs>, by and with the advice and consent of the <name>Senate</name>, the power of making treaties; and apprehensions have been expressed lest, under this treaty- making power, the <rs>President</rs> make a treaty providing that the <name>States</name> shall go into a convention with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States to alter and amend the <rs>Constitution</rs>.--The <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> itself seems to entertain some fears from this quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>We are convinced that they are groundless, if for no other reason, yet from the answer made by him to <persName n="Jacques,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Jacques,nomatch:0"><surname>Jacques</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gilmore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Gilmore,nomatch:0"><surname>Gilmore</surname></persName> when they made a proposition to submit all questions in dispute to a convention of all the <name>States</name>, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> and Confederate, in which a vote of <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> was to be decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We had seceded, he said, and were now fighting to get rid of the tyranny of the majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It is, therefore, we think, hardly reasonable to suppose that he will willfully violate the <rs>Constitution</rs> he is sworn to support in order that he may replace us under that very tyranny of the majority, from which we have effected our escape at the cost of so much blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>That it would be a palpable violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to use the treaty-making power &mdash; conferred with a very different object &mdash; to bring the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> into a convention with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States, we have no doubt is as clear to the <rs>President</rs> as it is to the writer in the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi>--as it is to everybody, indeed, who has read the <rs>Constitution</rs> and understands its objects, grants and limitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The Constitution has pointed out <num value="1">one</num> way of altering the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>If it be altered in any other way the <rs>Constitution</rs> is violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Now, by putting these States into a convention with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States, with the understanding that all parties are to acquiesce in the decision of such convention, we render not the change merely, but the <hi rend="italics">destruction</hi> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> a matter of absolute certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> Whenever a treaty of peace shall be made, it must be done solely on the basis of the entire independence and sovereignty of each particular State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>That must be preliminary to, and cannot be a subject of, negotiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has no right to make any peace in which <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> of land belonging to any <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> shall be given up, or <num value="1">one</num> iota of its privileges as a sovereign be surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>This, so far from being the subject of negotiation, must be the starting point from which all negotiation must proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>If the enemy refuse to concede it, then we cannot negotiate with him. It follows that there can be no such thing as treating for peace in earnest until every hostile soldier shall have been withdrawn from our soil and every hostile ship from our waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Then we can talk of peace and all those matters of secondary importance which it may be necessary to dispose of, and which, involving no principle, and affecting the rights of no State, come properly within the sphere of the treaty- making power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We have no reason to believe that <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Mary,J.,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> does not stand upon this ground, although we judge of his opinions only from his acts and his public declarations. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">President</rs> has no more power to put the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States into convention with ours than <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Mary,J.,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> has to put us into convention with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The treaty-making power is the same in both governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have long accustomed themselves to consider theirs a consolidated government, possessing all power for all purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The States they regard as possessing no more sovereignty than the counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Indeed, in <num value="1">one</num> of his speeches, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> expressly declared that they had no more power than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Should we agree, therefore, the convention would certainly take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It is wonderful, in the meantime, that intelligent men like <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00123" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wood,,Fernando,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="default:Wood,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> &mdash; who must be fully acquainted with the <rs>Southern</rs> doctrine of State rights, and must know that all this blood has been shed in their defence, --should think it possible to get us into such a convention, or to restore the <rs>Union</rs> by means of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>They can then, each State for itself, go into such a convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>This they will be pretty sure not to do; so that the hope of getting them into this scrape is but a lost hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The very act of sending delegates to such a convention would be construed by the sister States into a withdrawal from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The sending delegates to it would be an exercise of sovereignty, and as the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> is not sovereign, it follows as a necessary consequence that it can neither send delegates nor compel the <name>States</name> to do it. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> We feel satisfied of <num value="1">one</num> thing, and that is that <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is determined to try conclusions with the whole opposition to him, and that he has been steadily preparing for the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>He has, as we have before said, all the advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>He has the army, and all the appliances of war, and a police of keen detectives scattered over the whole land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>With these he can, to a great extent, overawe and control the politicians and the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But we do not think he depends upon the <hi rend="italics">votes</hi> he is to get to keep his seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>He will get the majority if he can; and he has some <hi rend="italics"><num value="65">sixty-five</num> votes</hi> in his pocket (more if the border States, the new States, and the rebel States held by his armies,) to start with &mdash; an important advantage over his competitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>If he gets the majority he will quietly continue in his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>If a competitor beats him he will hold it still &mdash; more than probably &mdash; on the ground that the election is not valid since all the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs> did not vote, and the claimant of the seat did not receive a majority of all, including all the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Declaring that there is no election, he will assume that the <name>Presidency</name> cannot be vacated, and that the incumbent, namely, himself, must fill it until there can be an election, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in the re-<placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">united States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>He can bribe <persName n="Wade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Wade,nomatch:0"><surname>Wade</surname></persName> or <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Mary,J.,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> with a mess of pottage if he thinks it best; or he can easily put them and the &#x0022;competitor&#x0022; in the Old Capital, where much better men have pined in chains. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> For all the stages of the election, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s machinery is ready, and will be put in operation at proper times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>He will break up the <orgName n="Chicago Convention" type="convention">Chicago Convention</orgName> if he thinks that best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The accusations brought against its leaders will give him pretext enough for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Again, it may be deemed most prudent to let it go on and split up the opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The time of the election, or near it, sufficing for the arrests, if necessary, of the leaders who are accused. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> Now, the question is, will the people and the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs> submit?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>There have been no States Rights ideas in the <rs>North</rs> for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. The people do not know the meaning of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>They understand as little the meaning of personal liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The idea of numerical power and the grandeur of a flourishing commerce and opulent cities have swallowed up everything of the sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Will such a people resist the usurpations of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>They have, indeed, States with all the powers of sovereignty, but their existences as sovereign resembles an old law grown obsolete and forgotten; any man attempting to revive it would only bring ridicule upon himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>All eyes are turned to <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> &mdash; all ideas swallowed up in centralization and aggregation of force and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>There is little reason therefore to anticipate any resistance on the score of States' Rights and Constitutional Liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> But there are other grounds upon which resistance may be more reasonably anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>They are: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, The burthen of taxation and the terrors of the service in the war. <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>, The idea of empire in the <rs>Northwest</rs>, and the reluctance of that part of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> to furnish more men and means for the war while the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> are shirking duty in the field and coining money out of the war; and, <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>, The spirit of opposition to the party in power which animates the aspirants for the <name>Presidency</name> and their followers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these grounds is quite strong, and will work powerfully upon the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Aided by our own valiant soldiers resisting <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s hordes in the field, the spirit of resistance on this ground may give <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> a vast deal of trouble. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> cause of resistance is even more serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The spirit of jealousy and hatred of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> is as strong in the <rs>Northwest</rs> as it was before the war in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Nay, stronger; for the <rs>South</rs> felt no <hi rend="italics">jealousy</hi> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>She detested her, desired to have nothing to do with her, and abhorred the burthens which Congress imposed upon her for the benefit of a people she justly execrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The Northwest is an empire in resources at once powerful and grand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The people there feel and know their power; and they know that the <rs>Federal</rs> tyranny is exhausting their means and oppressing them unreasonably and unequally, while the <rs>Northeast</rs> is reaping all the benefits of the war. They know that there is no sympathy between the sections; that their sympathies are with the inhabitants of the <rs type="place">Mississippi Valley</rs>; while their contributions of blood and treasure to the war only go to promote the opulence and political aggrandizement of the greedy, the avaricious and voracious Northeast, with which they have no sympathy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> From the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> and last named source of opposition to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s usurpation much cannot be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If the other causes are sufficient to present a strong array of resistance, the political leaders &mdash; the beasts and birds of prey &mdash; with all their hungry followers, may join the throng and make a great show of public virtue; but <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will more probably bribe the controlling men amongst then and thus take the main strength out of that element of hostility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> In this determination of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to usurp the <name>Presidency</name> for a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> term may consist the solution of the problem of the <orgName n="Northern Union" type="union">Northern Union</orgName>, now so much involved in mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It is the most certain mode of arousing the people to a sense of their rights and to the spirit of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>All that is necessary in that event is, that there shall be enough of public virtue, enough of the spirit of manhood and independence, to drive the <name>States</name> and the people to a successful resistance, which is their only hope of escape from the most odious tyranny that ever cursed mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Even with all the power and resolution that can be brought against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> at the <rs>North</rs>, the valor and the unconquerable spirit of the <rs>Southern</rs> people are indispensable to their success. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
