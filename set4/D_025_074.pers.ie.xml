<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Before stating anything in relation to news matters I beg leave to make <num value="1">one</num> explanation of the previous reports forwarded by telegraph and otherwise from this locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In the first place I telegraphed you from <placeName reg="Bristol, Bristol, England" key="tgn,7011198">Bristol</placeName> of the reported evacuation of <rs type="direction">Upper</rs> <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This movement on the part of the enemy was apparently progressing some few days' ago, and our pickets and scouts had actually advanced a considerable distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> last, for reasons not proper to mention, our advanced forces fell back to a point which for prudential reasons need not be named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>So much for the reported evacuation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The next in turn comes the battle said to have taken place at <placeName reg="Cotton Port, Meigs, Tennessee" key="tgn,2258495">Cottonport</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, in which the enemy's forces were defeated with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This report is neither confirmed nor contradicted, though very little credence if any is given to it here at that time, though it obtained credit in the best informed circles when it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reached our lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The situation and condition of affairs in front of our lines in the direction of <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> is very unfavorable for obtaining information, as a large majority of the inhabitants are tories, while the few Southern men who remain are invalids, cripples, or very weak-kneed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Consequently we have very few to come into our lines from that direction, and the result is that we have to remain in ignorance in regard to the doings of the enemy in our front, and but for the little information derived from our pickets and scouts we would be as profoundly in the dark as if we were in the nether regions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The few Southern men who remain at home within the enemy's lines, and all through <persName n="Carter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Carter,S.,P.,,"><surname>Carter</surname></persName> and other counties, have to be as circumspect as possible &mdash; keeping in doors for fear of the bush whackers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I am reliably informed that it is extremely hazardous for a Confederate to go alone in <placeName key="tgn,2001846" n="1.000 3" reg="carter, tennessee, united states">Carter county</placeName> just <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> South of this post, although that portion of the country is within our lines, but inhabited by as notorious Lincolnites as can be found in Lincolndom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of the forces of this department seems alive to the responsibilities of his office, and much depends on his management and skill; for if by any mishap or blunder we should be defeated here the whole of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and a part of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> will be indisputable in possession of the hated <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Much, however, depends on the result of the operations of <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:1"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s forces; for with a victory in that region down goes Lincolndom in all <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, and our line of communication in this direction will be open to the <rs>South</rs>. --From all that can be learned the actual <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force in our front must be small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The railroad within their lines as far as <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> is guarded by tories, a large number of whom act as scouts, pickets, &#x0026;c., for them. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> We run down to this point this afternoon, and I gather but few additional particulars proper for publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is satisfactorily ascertained that the enemy are gathering up commissary stores, horses, &#x0026;c., and are running them all down towards <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In many instances they have the wheat ground before it is sent off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This it will be noticed is a cute <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> trick, as these men have for the most part been exchanged, but being where they cannot get the information remain at home in fancied security. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Prisoners report the death of <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,Bob,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Johnson,Bob,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Bob</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnson,,Andy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Johnson,Andy,,,"><foreName>Andy</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> son. He is said to have died at <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville, Ala.</placeName>, in a drunken fit. It will be recollected that his oldest son was thrown from his horse in <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago and killed while on a drunken frolic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Thus is the arch traitor reaping the reward of his villainy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>A gentleman just arrived, and perfectly reliable, states that he left <placeName reg="Jonesborough, Washington, Tennessee" key="tgn,7023811">Jonesboro</placeName>' yesterday evening, and reports that no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were nearer than <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> west of that place at the time he left. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>for human hopes and expectation, we are doomed to disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>On our arrival at this post a telegram was received from <persName n="Bristol,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Bristol,nomatch:0"><surname>Bristol</surname></persName> stating that our pickets had been driven from the direction of <placeName reg="Weber City, Scott, Virginia" key="tgn,2114947">Moccasin Gap</placeName> and that the enemy were within a few miles of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Consequently the train was stopped here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Another train had left here for <placeName reg="Bristol, Sullivan, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098111">Bristol</placeName> a few minutes before the dispatch above referred to was received, which was met by the citizens of that place who were fleeing in consternation, some of them declaring that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were just outside the limits of the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The conductor of the train procured a horse and rode into town and found a large number of citizens leaving and preparing to leave, and from him I learn that couriers and scouts have come in and reported that <orgName n="cavalry regiment"><persName n="Carter,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Carter,S.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Carter</surname></persName>'s cavalry regiment</orgName>, which was stationed near Ready <placeName reg="Camp Ground, Obion, Tennessee" key="tgn,2216803">Camp Ground</placeName>, had been surprised by a brigade of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry and &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">cut all to pieces!</hi>&#x0022; He satisfied himself of the fact that the enemy were approaching <placeName reg="Bristol, Sullivan, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098111">Bristol</placeName> in some force, their numbers not known, and immediately put back and brought his train to this place. </p> <closer> <signed>O.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> This morning, about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>, <num value="1">one</num> of our pickets, who had been stationed near <placeName reg="Kingsport, Sullivan, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099840">Blountsville</placeName>, the county seat of <placeName reg="Sullivan, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2001918">Sullivan county</placeName>, and <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> from these headquarters, came dashing in and reported that a party of <num value="7">seven</num> men had been fired on at <placeName reg="Kingsport, Sullivan, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099840">Blountsville</placeName> by the enemy, who chased him to within a few miles of this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Our forces were soon in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At about <time value="11am">11 A.
