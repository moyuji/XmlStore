<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The important foreign news brought last evening by passengers from the <rs>North</rs>, via <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> by flag of truce, was received here with feelings of decided approbation and pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The evidences of gratification were seen in the smiling countenances of a number of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Boys amused themselves in the streets with fire crackers, <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> candles, fire-devils, &#x0026;c., and some person made a great light in the market place by burning barrels which had contained <num value="1">one</num> of the many combustible materials produced by the old <rs>North State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> There seems to be a general desire that the <rs>Northern Government</rs> may refuse to surrender the gentlemen who were, in so rude a manner, forced to leave the <name n="United Kingdom">British</name> steamer in which they had taken passage for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A refusal to apologize and to restore them to the position from which they were taken, will doubtless cause <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>And the attack would not be long delayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The work of destroying the so called powerful <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States Navy</orgName> would be commenced at a very early day &mdash; that mammoth, rapid, steel-plated, and powerful war steamer H. M. <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Warrior</rs>, being at the head of the <rs>Queen</rs>'s grand armada. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Then will follow, of course, the closing of the <rs>Northern</rs> ports and the opening of the <rs>Southern</rs>, the acknowledgment of the independence of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, a plentiful supply of cotton from the <rs>South</rs> for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, plentiful quantities of all things needful for the <rs>South</rs> from <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> ports, a still more terrible and effective blow at the commerce and manufactures of the <rs>Northern</rs> cities, the rapid growth of the cities of the <rs>South</rs>, and not improbably a speedy termination of the war forced upon the <rs>South</rs> by the abolition fanatics of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Some persons here think <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> will soon turn up crazy, and that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, the elegant gentleman who so ably presides over the attractive menagerie, will be devoured by some of the wild beasts around him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The remarkably bright, dry and healthful weather continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Indeed we have almost a drought in winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The cisterns are nearly empty, the roads are dusty, and the swamps and low-grounds are getting as dry as in summer time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is not improbable that we shall have a change before <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>, and that there will be enough of rain, snow and cold weather before the winter is over. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The price is <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">$25</measure> per sack, and holders not anxious to sell at that price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> During the past week it was widely rumored that <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would surely be attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Indeed, so sanguine were some that the prediction would come true, bets were freely made; but as yet they have not made their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Nor is it probable they will for some time to come, as they are little disposed to undertake an adventure to our city, fraught as it would be with such dangerous consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The heavy firing of yesterday was merely the practicing of heavy ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When the wind is from the <rs>North</rs> the sound is very distinct, but when from the <rs>South</rs>, to us it is sometimes scarcely audible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> We were recently shown a new invention in the way of a splendid rifle cannon, which far surpasses anything of the kind we have ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It was made in <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and from the name of its maker, receives the name of the <q>&#x0022;<dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> Sun.&#x0022;</q> The great advantage gained, is the frequency with which it can be fired,--the breach never becoming hot from constant firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the <date value="14">14th</date> inst., and the resolution of the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName> inviting me to occupy <num value="1">one</num> of the privileged seats on the floor of the <rs type="place">Hall</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I thank you sincerely for the kind and cordial manner in which you were pleased to inform me of the distinguished honor conferred upon me by the enlightened and patriotic body over which you preside; and I beg you to assure the <rs type="place">House</rs> that I earnestly appreciate this delicate and generous expression of its approbation and good will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Although the resolution conveys a high compliment personal to my self (for which I am the more grateful in as much as I feel that it exceeds my actual merits,) I am, nevertheless, perfectly sensible that the great purpose of the representatives of the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in adopting this resolution, was, to show to the world how deeply they sympathize with the loyal sons of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> in the severe tribulations which <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> has sent upon them to try their faith and to chasten their affections.--Whilst bowed down to the earth in their great agony, and driven almost to despair by that <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">hope deferred which maketh the heart sick,</hi>&#x0022;</q> the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> are not unmindful of another salutary purpose which the <name>Great Disposer</name> of events may contemplate in thus subjecting them for a time to the fiery or deal of Northern despotism and cruelty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> If <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> land had entered the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> ago, she would have brought with her a comparatively small but exceedingly vicious class of men, whose corruption would have secretly festered in the body politic, and ultimately, perhaps, have caused its decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>On the <date value="04-19">19th of last April,</date> many of these men were ready to hail the <orgName n="Southern Banner" type="newspaper">Southern banner</orgName>, if convinced of its power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The events of the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> have unmasked those servile camp followers of the <rs>Northern</rs> despot, and placed between them and the true men of the <rs>State</rs> a gulf, which must ever remain impassible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is distinctly understood now that <num value="1">one</num> or the other of those hostile classes must occupy and possess the <rs>State</rs>, to the exclusion of the other, whenever the final issue shall have been made by an appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>As I cannot doubt what the result of that conflict will be, I feel no hesitation in predicting that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, like <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, will come into the great conservative republic of the <rs>South</rs>, purified of the social and political contaminations which were brought upon a noble race of men by the money seeking emigrants from the land of agrarian fanaticism and sordid passion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The taint of Northern pelf and the ulcers of Northern Red <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> demagogues will rapidly vanish as the old State passes through the furnace of affliction into which she has been cast by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, with a fiercer rage than that of the idolatrous <rs>Nebuchadnezzar</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> Hence it is, sir, that, drawing much consolation from this faith, we strive to mitigate the rigor of our exile, and to stifle the sorrow which rises in our hearts as we listen to the wail of our suffering friends, borne to our ears upon every breeze that crosses the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and salutes the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag.--We have never permitted ourselves to doubt that flag will, at the proper time, be advanced to the rescue of our people from their cruel thraldom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I speak what I know, when I say, that, despite the insolent mockeries of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> ballot box in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, held by perjured serfs and upheld by their master's bayonets; despite the cringing falsehood of official demagogues and the purchased testimony of a recreant and suborned executive; despite the clamor of a subsidized press and the pusillanimity of the mammon-worshippers &mdash; there has always been in our noble State an over whelming majority of the people hostile to the <rs>Northern</rs> despot, and devotedly attached to the cause of Southern independence and constitutional liberty.--And now, after the bitter experiences of the last half year, it is certain, beyond all peradventure, that the actual adherents of the <rs>Northern Government</rs> do not amount to a tithe of the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Fraud, intimidation, violence, threats of confiscation, imprisonment, the continued pressure of arrogant military rule, petty official persecution, the temptations of patronage, and all other base means so familiar to tyrants, have been used with a zeal worthy of a less infamous cause, to extort from the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> an expression of <q>&#x0022;loyalty to the <rs>Union</rs>,&#x0022;</q> as they still persist in characterizing the decayed remains of the old Government; and yet, their bastiles are filled to repletion with <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> martyrs; and they dare not for <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">one instant</day></dateStruct> withdraw from her soil the armed mercenaries, who, in their imbecile terror, stand guard at the doors of rebel women and arrest rebel boys for wearing the obnoxious colors of the <rs>Southern</rs> flag, more terrible to the tyrant's minions than anything on earth except the <rs>Southern</rs> steel which glittered around that flag on an <num value="100">hundred</num> fields of victory.--No!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>They well understand that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is at heart a <q>&#x0022;rebel,&#x0022;</q> as she was in <num value="76">76</num>; and they remember the history of her deeds and the fate of her tories. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> It would be an act of supererogation in me to undertake a detailed explanation of the causes which led to this, temporary subjugation of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It is due to her, however, that I should briefly allude to certain prominent facts. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Her Executive had not the manhood to oppose a revolution which he feared and hated, until he was surrounded by Northern bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Cowering under the storm of popular indignation, he went into <address><street n="Monument square">Monument square</street></address> on the afternoon of the memorable <date value="04-19">19th of April</date> last, whilst the blood of the heroic youths of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, who had scornfully driven out of their city <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> armed abolitionists from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, was still fresh upon the pavements, and there called <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to witness his loyalty to the <rs>South</rs>, and prayed that his arm might rot from the socket if he ever raised it against his Southern brethren. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> Such a man, as we well knew, would not have dared to lift his finger against secession in the month of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It was, however, geographically and politically impossible for <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> to join the cotton States whilst other great States, lying between her and the new Confederacy, remained even nominally in union with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The delay from <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> to <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct> was fatal to her; and that delay was beyond her control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> then came into power, with his navy threatening the bay and rivers which penetrate the <rs>State</rs> at every vital point, and with his army gathering its mighty columns from the <rs>North</rs>, professedly for the protection of the <rs>Federal Capital</rs>, but in reality, as we have since witnessed, for the invasion of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> had no arms, no ammunition, no military organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Her false-hearted Governor had purposely left her in a defenceless condition, in order that he might, with out peril to himself, deliver her up, at the suitable time, to be crucified, and receive his <num value="30">thirty</num> pieces of silver as the price of his unspeakable treachery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> Then, as now, she required only arms, ammunition, and <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> to organize her rural population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Had she been so fortunate as to have had her lot cast south of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, she would have accomplished her redemption long ago. Being the only highway from the <rs>North</rs> to the <rs>Federal Capital</rs>, her subjugation of course became a political and military necessity with the <rs>Northern</rs> people; and as she was separated by a wide river from her Southern brethren, and was wholly without exception of early assistance from any quarter, it became evident that her effort to resist invasion, however gallant and determined, would have resulted in certain defeat, and the consequent destruction of <placeName reg="Baltimore Independent City, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,7021987">Baltimore city</placeName>, which contains <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of her whole population, and nearly all of her commercial capital and enterprise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> then had less than <num value="3500">thirty-five hundred</num> rifles and muskets, <num value="10">ten</num> or a dozen small field pieces, and not <num value="1">one</num> cannon to defend the approaches to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>She was surrounded by the flower of the hostile army, and cut off from all support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Many loyal and gallant men refused to precipitate so unequal a contest, to be followed by such inevitable and calamitous results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>They would have been willing to carry the <rs>State</rs> out of the <rs>Union</rs> in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, or even <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>; but in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> they believed it to be impracticable, unless at the sacrifice of everything which constituted the material power of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>They believed that time would afford an opportunity for the accomplishment of the great purpose, without demanding such a price as the destruction of their commercial emporium. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> Nevertheless, these loyal and gallant men were at all times ready to bring a blackened ruin into the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, rather <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> than to purchase immunity at the cost of public virtue and private honor; rather than to wear the flower and jewels of oriental slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>They have always been ready to decide between these alternatives, whenever necessarily and definitely presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>At this moment with outstretched arms, they stand upon their desecrated hearthstones, crying out to their Southern brethren to give them an opportunity to pronounce this decision on the field of battle.
