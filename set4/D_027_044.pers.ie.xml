<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> We alluded yesterday to a report that <placeName key="possibilities=31" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Signal Hill</placeName> was in the possession of the enemy, and stated that it then lacked confirmation, but it afterwards turned out to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It appears that the hill was occupied without opposition on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and that the enemy immediately set about fortifying the position on the front towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.--Our commander, however, determined that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> should not hold quiet possession of a position they had taken so easily, and arrangements were made to drive them off. Accordingly, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, our iron-clads, under the command of <persName n="Mitchell,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, steamed down the <rs>James</rs> until they got within range of the hill, when they opened, a furious cannonade, sending shells with accuracy into the very midst of the enemy's forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The firing was heavy and rapid, the report of the guns being distinctly heard in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>After some show of resistance, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> abandoned their position and fled, leaving the hill in possession of our troops, and our signal station has since been re-established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName key="possibilities=31" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Signal Hill</placeName> is on the plantation of <persName n="Cox,Mister,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Cox,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Cox</surname></persName>, about <placeName><distance reg="2.5miles">two miles and a half</distance> below <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName></placeName>.

The enemy, in a furious charge, succeeded in breaking through <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Wright,nomatch:0"><surname>Wright</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, but was speedily driven back, with terrible slaughter, by <orgName n="NC brigade"><persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Lane,nomatch:0"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s North Carolina brigade</orgName> and some of <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Elizabeth,,,:1"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Benning,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Benning,nomatch:0"><surname>Benning</surname></persName>'s Georgians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>That portion of the enemy who held the works to our left were charged by <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> of our men, driven back, and thus our original lines were re-established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In this charge we <measure n="600" type="captured">captured six hundred</measure> prisoners, a stand of colors and several <num value="100">hundred</num> fine arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Officers who were engaged in the fight on Tuesday represent that the slaughter of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> exceeded that of the <date value="07-30">30th of July</date> in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>. --Indeed, they received such a severe punishment that they have been contented to remain comparatively quiet ever since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> Last evening about <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> heavy cannonading was heard down the river, which continued with great rapidity for about an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We learned that this proceeded from our gunboats shelling the position supposed to be occupied by the enemy, and the enemy's gunboats shelling the shore where they supposed the rebels were posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>About the same time there was some heavy skirmishing near <placeName reg="Newmarket Hill">Newmarket Hill</placeName>, a body of our troops having been sent forward to ascertain the position of the enemy. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> The quiet in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> was broken yesterday morning about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> by our batteries, which opened along the whole line upon the enemy, who responded feebly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This was kept up for about an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, when all became quiet again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> It was reported yesterday morning that the enemy's cavalry were making some demonstration upon our right, and later in the day its object was developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It is reported that they succeeded, by a flank movement, in striking the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>, <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>, burnt the <rs type="place">Brick House</rs>, and probably tore up some portion of the track.--Heavy firing was heard yesterday afternoon in that direction, and it is presumed that our forces were engaged in a conflict with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The intention of the raiders is supposed to be to strike the <rs>Southside</rs> and <rs>Danville</rs> railroads, but the design may be frustrated by the skill of our officers and the valor of the troops under their command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> Notwithstanding the fact that a large number of the enemy's troops have been withdrawn, a heavy force still remains in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and the indications are that they have no intention of abandoning that line of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Their guns are yet mounted as before, except, perhaps, in some positions on the left, and their boasted mortars are still in place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Their line of battle, though somewhat withdrawn at points, is still unimpaired, and their pickets are as active as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The heavy rain of Monday washed a large breach in their works in the rear of <placeName><persName n="Griffith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Griffith,nomatch:0"><surname>Griffith</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, (on our right,) which, up to <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, they had not been able to repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Our pickets opened a heavy fire upon that portion of the line as soon as the earth was washed away, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> gave way and fled in confusion to their main works. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> The sickness in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> is reported to be on the increase, and hospitals have been erected at intervals on all the roads leading to <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> After the above was written we received the press dispatch, giving an account of operations near <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It appears that the raiders were met by <persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Walker,H.,H.,,:1"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>'s Virginia and <orgName n="MS brigades"><persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s Mississippi brigades</orgName>, and a fight ensued, in which we <measure n="158" type="captured">captured one hundred and fifty- eight</measure> prisoners.

A gabion is a hollow cylinder, of wicker work, resembling a basket, but having no bottom, which is filled with earth, and serves to shelter the workmen from the enemy's fire.

<head>Recruiting for <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> The Government of the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">State of Massachusetts</placeName> is the most contemptible Government in the whole world, except the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> (as the latter is at present administered). Both of these concurs are coming money out of Southern blood, and both are, therefore, desirous to have the war continued <hi rend="italics">ad infinitum.</hi> Both are equally determined not to expose their subjects to personal danger, and both resort to expedients peculiarly characteristic to avoid the necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> takes every opportunity to proclaim that she is neutral, while she is constantly rendering to our enemy the most effective assistance and inflicting upon us the most intolerable wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Thus she keeps her own carcass out of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/><placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> cannot go exactly so far as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>This war is her war. It is a per job, by which she hopes to buy her way to heaven, and make a huge sum besides, in the way of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>But she <hi rend="italics">must</hi> furnish her <hi rend="italics">quota</hi> of men; and she has found out a way to do it. &#x0022;The solid men of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>,&#x0022; in days gone by, made fortunes by kidnapping negroes on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> and selling them to the farmers and planters of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <name>Carolinas</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The descendants of these same &#x0022;solid men of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>&#x0022; make up their <hi rend="italics">quota,</hi> in part, by kidnapping the descendants of these same kidnapped <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs>, and putting them forward to be slaughtered at the rate of <num value="10000">10,000</num> a day. Thus <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 8170" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> manifests a zeal to keep up the slaughter, and to keep out of the danger, fully as earnest, and quite as commendable, as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, when she supplies the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> recruits per annum, and <hi rend="italics">hopes,</hi> through her foreign secretary, that the war may only end with the complete overthrow of slavery, or, in other words, with the extermination of the white inhabitants of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Both these traffickers in blood are singularly religious, and both convinced that the book called the New Testament is obsolete, and has been superseded by a new revelation, which teaches that the old difficulty about serving <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and <placeName reg="Mammon">Mammon</placeName> is an absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Their new religion is much more convenient, and therefore, of course, much more popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>It teaches that it is very well to serve <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, provided &#x0022;it will pay; &#x0022;otherwise, the service of <placeName reg="Mammon">Mammon</placeName> is preferable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> The determination of the &#x0022;solid men&#x0022; to carry on their &#x0022;big job&#x0022; as long as &#x0022;it will pay&#x0022; has of late been made plain in a very peculiar way; and the determination of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to afford all facilities for keeping up the flame, and not suffering it to expire for want of fuel, has likewise been shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/><placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, it seems, cannot kidnap negroes enough to exempt <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the &#x0022;solid men, &#x0022; and the &#x0022;solid men&#x0022; cannot go to the war without running the risk of getting shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Fortunately, an expedient presents itself which solves the difficulty without exposing the &#x0022;solid men.&#x0022; <num value="1">One</num> <persName n="Allen,Mister,Julian,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="default:Allen,Julian,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Julian</foreName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, who, it seems, is a Pole, although he spells his name with an unusually small stock of consonants for <num value="1">one</num> of his race, renowned alike for martial prowess and the unpronounceable character of those <hi rend="italics">indicia</hi> by which men are accustomed to reveal their nominative case, has undertaken to furnish them with recruits from <placeName reg="Nederland" key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Belgie" key="tgn,1000063">Belgium</placeName>, and the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> generally, upon speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Of course there is no want of a British ship to bring over these interesting strangers, and it might be dangerous to trust the cargo to any other than an intensely neutral bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/><persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName>, it is true, is shipless at the present moment, but <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Wood,nomatch:0"><surname>Wood</surname></persName> is abroad, and Yankeedom has lately heard from him in a way not at all calculated to allay any fears that she may be liable to entertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/><persName n="Allen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="nearbymention:Allen,Julian,,,"><surname>Allen</surname></persName>'s menagerie, if entrusted to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ship, might be brought to grief some fine morning, and its cargo of brutes sent to kingdom come on very short notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>But a <hi rend="italics">British</hi> vessel is neutral-- <hi rend="italics">perfectly</hi> neutral--<hi rend="italics">extremely</hi> neutral &mdash; amazingly neutral &mdash; a <hi rend="italics">perfect model</hi> of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> says so. <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> says so. The <rs>Queen</rs> says so. The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> says so. It must be so. <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> itself is certainly the most neutral nation in the world, and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> is the most neutral man in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, except <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, who is the very pink of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>They will be safe on board of an English vessel, of course; and so on board of an English vessel, they are put at <placeName key="tgn,2078243" n="1.000 6" reg="antwerp, paulding, ohio">Antwerp</placeName> to the number of <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num>, and in the course, of time are duly landed at <placeName key="tgn,1006938" n="1.000 3" reg="deer island,new brunswick,canada,north and central america">Deer island</placeName>, in the harbor of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>On the passage they were drilled every day by another Pole, who, having been exiled from his own country, probably thought it would be a relief to his feelings to visit upon others what he had endured himself; as the <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> who had his tail cut off by a steel-trap became exceedingly anxious that his whole race should appear in uniform, and, in a council of the tribe, recommended a general suppression of the caudal appendage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The whole affair, it seems, was a &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">speculation.</hi>&#x0022; The <orgName n="New York Evening Post" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Evening Post</hi></orgName> says &#x0022;nobody not interested was wiser, while <num value="3">three</num> individuals were much richer, and <num value="400">four hundred</num> men were credited to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.&#x0022;--The authorities of the countries to which these men belong did not, it seems, take any steps to prevent this atrocious evasion of all neutrality, but rather encouraged it than otherwise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> All praise to this glorious Confederacy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>It has withstood, and is still withstanding, the combined strength of all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in addition to that of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and its own negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>There never was such a struggle, so gloriously unequal in point of numbers, so gloriously triumphant wherever prowess could be expected to prevail against odds, so calm in its conduct, so resolute in its resistance, so defiant in its mood, so uncomplaining in its sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Talk of all the wars and revolutions and successful resistances that have ever been recorded!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We have read of them all, and none deserve to be mentioned on the same day with this struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Such will be the verdict of posterity, when time shall have mellowed events which are now of late occurrence and invested them with the halo which never rests upon glorious deeds until we recede a certain distance from them. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> The <rs>Queen</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in her late speech, is made, for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> time within the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, to call this war the &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">civil</hi> war now raging in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.&#x0022; It is not to be supposed that these gratuitous insults emanate from the <rs>Queen</rs> herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>She is far too great a lady to know or care aught about <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, or the war raging therein, or the character thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>They are the work of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, and are peculiarly characteristic of the small, spiteful, and better understanding of that contemptible little minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>We regret to observe that the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, on a late occasion, thought proper to employ the same terms in speaking of the war &mdash; regret it, not from any feeling of respect for that functionary, whose treacherous dealing with the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in regard to the rams built in the <rs>French</rs> ports has revealed his true character too fully to leave him any title to reverence on our part &mdash; but because we are pained to see the head of the <rs>French</rs> nation treading in the footsteps, and repeating the language, of the <rs>British</rs> minister like a tame parrot which has been taught its lesson and will not go beyond it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>To call this &#x0022;a civil war&#x0022; is to place us in the category of rebels, and therefore to take sides with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>It is to interferes, in a most unwarrantable and most unjustifiable manner, in the internal affairs of this people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>It is to be precisely the reverse of what the <rs>British Government</rs> affects to be in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> Had we only had a navy which could have coped with that of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">yankees</rs> from the beginning, we should never have heard these insults.
