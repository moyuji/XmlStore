<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The evacuation, retreat, falling back, <q>&#x0022;going up.&#x0022;</q> or whatever else you please to call it, of the <orgName n="Army of Mississippi" type="army">army of the Mississippi</orgName>, from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> is now a fixed, unchangeable, immutable, unsuitable fact, and as the thing is done, I suppose there is no harm in saying so. The Federal have found it out, and our own people need no longer be kept in the dark by the either in a mantle with which the army officials have <unclear></unclear> their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>By this time <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> is <q>&#x0022;weeping, walling, and gashing his teeth,&#x0022;</q> with chagrin at having been so completely filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that our brave little <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs> has had occasion to retire before the enemy, and the success which attended the movement has stamped him at once as the muster General of the war.--With an enemy immediately in front of him, shelling his men even while they were in the act of retiring, with sick to move <unclear></unclear> of provisions to be provided with a places of safety, and all the multifarious operations of an army to be performed, he succeeded even beyond his own expectations in placing himself fairly beyond the reach of the foe before they were aware of the intended evacuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I have not heard that a men was lost, or a dollar's worth of nobles property destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <unclear></unclear>, however, have not yet transpired, and it may be that before the army reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Its resting place, the <name>Roer</name> guard were slightly engaged with the <rs>Federal</rs> skirmishers. --This supposition is induced by several returns in town this morning, to the effect that a portion of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Price,Sterling,,,"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had a fight after the main body of the army had moved out. I said there was no loss of public property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><num value="4">Four</num> trains of cars were destroyed, and <num value="6">six</num> engines; but this was done by the railroad officials, under a misapprehension of instructions when the trains were left between <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pocahontas, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057263">Pocahontas</placeName>, and the <num value="3">three</num> badges being burned which connected these places, nothing could be done but destroy the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The loss, however, is not great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We already have more rolling stock than we can use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The causes which led to the evacuation are such as will commend themselves to every fairly judging mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> was, so to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>powerless.--Had he advanced upon the entrenchments of the enemy, already within a mile &mdash; indeed, so near that shell were thrown into the heart of his camps &mdash; his success, if at all, should have been limited, and the loss of life would have been great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The Federal could have fallen back foot by foot, contesting every inch of ground, and thus compelled our men to follow, clambering over <hi rend="italics">abattis</hi> and among their enfilading ambuscades, while death thinned our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A complete rout, such as was necessary to ensure complete victory, was, therefore, at least, doubtful, if not impossible, and the result of a failure would have been disastrous in the extreme. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Now, however, we have <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> in our tolls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The picture is reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We have fallen back out of the woods into open fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>where a battle when fought may be comprehended at a glance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Our camping ground is better, the water is pure, and the health of our men will be much improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In a military point of view, our advantages are that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>while <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> is compelled to follow, or relinquish the pursuit altogether, he can no longer do so under cover of entrenchments concealed in thick woods; while our opportunities for making or preventing flanking movements are proportionately increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The further the <rs>Federal General</rs> marches his army of <num value="70000">70,000</num> away from his gunboats and transports, the greater will be the difficulties by which he will be upset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Already his men are dying by hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>No longer ago than last week <num value="15">fifteen</num> Federal transports went down the river loaded with Federal sick, and it may easily be imagined that the effect produced upon the unacclimated <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> when they attempt to march through the <unclear></unclear> bottoms of the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs>, will be of such a terrible nature as to raise a howl of indignation in the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name> against the cautious, ditching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> The <rs>Nellie</rs> was placed under my command early last <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, and soon after called from this port for a port in the <placeName reg="Bahamas" key="tgn,1009859">Bahama Islands</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>where she was told and transferred to a British subject, therein re-aiding and duty registered as a British ship under the <rs>British</rs> flag, I still retaining the command &mdash; From that times I regularly traded, without even being over hated or spoken by any <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> blockading vessel or cruiser up to the <date value="05-26">26th May </date> At <time value="6am">6 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>I did not heave my ship to ascertain which undesired, but kept my ship steadily on her course, the schooner in full chase, and continuing her fire as fast as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> Soon came blockader, <num value="2">No. 2</num>, opening on us with shot and shelf and from guns of heavy calibre, about <num value="3">three</num> points on the port bow and <measure n="1.5miles" type="distance">one and a half miles distant</measure>, and <rs n="Blockader 3">Blockader No. 3</rs> <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles distant</measure>, broad on my port beam but holding his fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>I continued to his my ship close along the breakers of <placeName key="tgn,7015824" n="1.000 2" reg="long island city, queens, new york">Long Island</placeName> Beach, until up with <placeName reg="Captor's Inlet">Captor's Inlet</placeName>, when the ship steam being within a miles and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, distant, opened on me, and the <num value="1">one</num> ahead, although within a mile distant, <unclear></unclear> fire and headed immediately in for the point of breakers which I had to clear to save my ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>This I saw impossible to be done, and decided at once to try and get into <persName n="Caper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Caper,nomatch:0"><surname>Caper</surname></persName>'s insist or beach the ship. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> Although the wind was blowing strong from the northeast, and breakers running high, I deemed it better to try to save my people among Clends, at the risk of drowning, than risk a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The boats were lowered, therefore, to put the people on shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>(and now comes a scene that all the civilized world should know, and more particularly the mariner, as he is taught that with his country's flag at half mast and union-down, he demands the constance of a brother mariner and the sympathies of an enemy, and particularly a defenceless ship in a defenceless position.) The <num value="3">three</num> vessels now opened are on my ship, mostly with shell, until the boats were started on shore, when they drew their fire from the ship and directed it at the boats, trying to destroy those poor creatures while battling with the <unclear></unclear> to save their lives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> Deeming it, my duty to try to prevent this, I hoisted the <rs>British</rs> ensign, my national flag, half mast and union down, with my own hands, thinking it would appease their wrath, seeing my ship was in a defenceless condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>But instead of that it seemed to increase their which, for the shell from the <num value="2">two</num> largest ships came faster and with more precision, scoffingly determined to destroy all the defenceless souls on board that fated ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>I walked after and hewed down that emblem which is dear to every sailor's bosom, disgusted with myself that I had ever hoisted it half mast or union down, but rather have taken the chances, as I had to do, of having all my people destroyed, than to have shown distress to so inhuman and detestable an enemy.--We all succeeded in getting on shore, however, without taking a dose of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pills. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> contains a letter from <num value="1">one</num> of its numerous correspondents in <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, in which we are informed that it is the opinion of his officers that the <rs>South</rs> requires to be civilized, and they think that Northern colonization in the <rs>South</rs> would be an admirable process for effecting that end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> We think it likely that the <hi rend="italics">Herald's</hi> correspondent tells the truth about this matter, as there seems to be no motive for a lie, and, indeed, that such is the general sentiment of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>There are different opinions, however, about that thing called civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/><persName n="Mitchell,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="default:Mitchell,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, in his address, some years ago, to the <rs>Literary Societies</rs> of the <rs type="place">University</rs>, expressed his especial disgust with the word <q>&#x0022;Civilization,&#x0022;</q> which, he said, was a word <q>&#x0022;vague in meaning, barbarous in form, a hybrid word, a word with a Latin head and a Greek tail, and like hundreds of other new fangled words, on that principle, dubious and confused in its acceptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>If you ask the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> men you meet in a railroad car what is civilization, <num value="9">nine</num> will tell you that it is steam, electricity, a <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing press</rs>, perhaps the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> that it is commerce, whereas it is simple justice.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> The Northern idea of civilization is essentially that described by <persName n="Mitchell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It is machinery, and has no reference whatever to humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>It is manufactures, commerce, and materialism in every shape and form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It does not mean the development of those social virtues which enable society adequately to discharge its main functions, of preventing wrong-doing and ensuring justice, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> between man and man, and then between nation and nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>If <persName n="Mitchell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> has come anywhere near the mark in declaring that civilization means justice &mdash; justice between man and man, and nation and nation &mdash; what a fine set of fellows these <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are to be holding themselves up as models of civilization, and looking down upon the <name>Southron</name> as barbarians!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But, then, on the other hand, if civilization consists in gas, electricity, steam, and commerce, no <num value="1">one</num> can deny that they are the most civilized of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> If we look abroad upon the face of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> country, what do we see?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>A widespread territory, in which the cultivation of the soil and rural avocations are held in little respect, and city life is the great attraction of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The cities are the great hives of all the energy, skill, talent, and rascality of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Commerce and manufactures are the only employments by which they desire to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The rural districts, stripped of every element of strength and influence, look to the cities for instruction in everything, and are humble copyists of their fashions and their vices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>These last are more easily transplanted, and have taken root widely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The records of crime in the country portions of the <rs>North</rs> show that they are not much behind the cities in every species of iniquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>If being civilized means reading, writing, somewhat indifferent spelling, and a knowledge of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="4">four</num> rules of arithmetic, then the majority of the <rs>Northern</rs> rural population deserve to be so considered, though the manner in which they talk through their noses and murder the <rs>King</rs>'s English, do not establish any very strong claims to precedence on that score.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>If being civilized, means to be <q>&#x0022;cute,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;smart,&#x0022;</q> and to cheat your neighbor in a trade, they were undoubtedly the most civilized people on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>If being civilized means that all the houses must be painted white and all the shutters green, with a cake of gingerbread and <num value="2">two</num> apples in the front window, and a couple of codfish hanging on the clothes line, then no <num value="1">one</num> can deny the claims of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> rural districts to civilization, such as it is. Nor is the life of the cities any better entitled to that <q>&#x0022;vague and meaningless&#x0022;</q> appellation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/><persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> was right when he pronounced great cities sores upon the body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>New York, the <rs type="place">Empire City</rs>, may be taken as a mir specimen of them all. There is in that city a vast amount of gas, electricity, steam, <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing presses</rs>, and commerce; but there are, also, a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> paupers, who are supported by public charity, <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> prostitutes, and a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> criminals, who are certainly engaged in making war upon life and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Nearly <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the whole population of this boasted centre of Northern civilization is confessedly gangrened and rotten!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The civilization of such a city cannot be found outside its <rs n="gas fixtures" type="product">gas fixtures</rs> and steam boilers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Nothing can be more civilized than its machinery; nothing more barbarous than its humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Looking at its outside, <num value="1">one</num> is dazzled by its whiteness; but within there is the smell and corruption of the charnel house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It has splendid houses, whose proprietors never dine at home, but leave their wives and children to make their dinner off a cup of tea and a cold round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It is full of gorgeous churches, where the minister has a grand levee on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the week, in which he endeavors to entertain his visitors to the best of his ability, whilst the sexton is so particular as to the appearance of the guests who are admitted that, if <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName> were to make their appearance at the door in the same apparel in which they evangelized the world, he would take them out by the coat collar and hand them over for safe-keeping to the nearest policeman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>They have <persName n="Beechers,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Beechers,nomatch:0"><surname>Beechers</surname></persName> and Tyngs, who surpass all other preachers in their pretensions to superior zeal and godliness, and urge robbers and murderers to overrun and desolate the <rs>South</rs>, holding out to them the pardon of their sins and the hope of Heaven as the reward of their crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>They have Christian Associations, made up of very nice people &mdash; i. e., according to <persName n="Swift,,Dean,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="default:Swift,Dean,,,"><foreName>Dean</foreName> <surname>Swift</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;people of very nasty ideas&#x0022;</q>--young men who, up to the period of the present war, were so handsomely dressed that they looked the very pinks of <q>&#x0022;civilization,&#x0022;</q> and smiled so meekly that they might have passed for pocket editions of the <rs>Apostle St. John</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>They looked, these fine fellows, as if butter would scarcely melt in their mouths, and that nothing would give them greater pleasure than to be eaten up by lions or martyred into steaks for the good of manking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>They were so particular in their morals that they considered it a sin to laugh audibly, and so compassionate to human suffering that they regarded the capital punishment of a criminal as little better than the crime for which he suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>They had immense union prayer- meetings, not <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, at which they gave the most astounding evidences not only of civilization, but of such supernatural religious graces, as made a good many people believe that the <sic>millenium</sic> was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>And now, what has become of all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Why, these very associations and prayer-meetings, which might have made us believe that New York was far ahead of the <rs type="place">Celestial City</rs> itself in godliness and purity, became, with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blast of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s war trumpet, transformed into ravenous wolves, not a vestige of the sheep or lamb left; not <num value="1">one</num> evangelical fleece, not a single pious bleat; but the whole pack howling together in a furious concert for Southern blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> When the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers call all this civilization, and propose to spread it among us outside barbarians by the process of colonization, they must not be surprised if we resist them to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We may not have much gas, electricity, steam, commerce, but neither have we armies of paupers, strumpets, robbers, and murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Our churches may be plain and simple, but the pure doctrines of Christianity are preached therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Our <persName n="Associa,,Christian,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="default:Associa,Christian,,,"><foreName>Christian</foreName> <surname>Associa</surname></persName>- <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> tions may not wear as solemn and sanctimonious an aspect as their own, but they are made up of gentlemen and Christians, who are incapable of putting off their religious profession with as much facility as if it were an old coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>We may not have costly houses, but we have kind and hospitable people in them, enough to cut and drink, and the staples from which the whole wealth of the <rs>North</rs> has been drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>We may be poor, but we hold in high esteem those virtues of truth, honor, chastity, and honesty, which have something to do with genuine civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> value their peculiar civilization, let them keep it to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We do not need it, do not want it, and will have none of it. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> The specimens which we every day present to our readers of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mendacity prove that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper writers find great difficulty in keeping up the spirits of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They have discovered long since that they cannot do it by telling the truth, and they therefore abandon the truth entirely as an obsolete idea, or a broken weapon, which it is no longer possible to use with effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>It ought to be a source of great encouragement to the <rs>South</rs> to find that they are confronted with an adversary whose courage it requires such extraordinary stimulants to screw and keep to the sticking point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> imagination is very poor in those arts which depend principally upon the exercise of that faculty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>They have had several <num value="1000">thousand</num> writers of rhyme and blank verse, but not a single poet, so far as we remember, with the exception of <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Bryant,nomatch:0"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The have had painters and sculptors out of number &mdash; men who could draw a horse or carve a man out of marble &mdash; but there is scarcely a man among the whole number who seems to have had the slightest glimpse of the ideal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The inventive faculty is strong in them all, but the inventive power is totally wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>If a great invention is brought to light in the mechanical world, they steal it. If a highly original work is published in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, they imitate it, or rather appropriate it, and treat it, as <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> said the gipsies treat stolen children &mdash; that is, disguise and begrime its features to such a degree that the very parent would not know it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>In fact, no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ever invented anything but a lie. There they are without rivals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It seems to be a national talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Few of them are without it, and the few that have it not envy the larger number who possess it, as despair only can envy superior merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is so completely a national characteristic that no man in Yankeedom sees any harm in it. They are entirely deficient in what <persName n="Locke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Locke,nomatch:0"><surname>Locke</surname></persName> and other ethical writers call the <q>&#x0022;moral sense&#x0022;</q>--that is, the capacity to distinguish between good and evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It is probable, therefore, that the <rs>Southern</rs> prints are dealing too harshly with <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> for his lying bulletins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It would be as fair to blame the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> for being black, or the serpent for not walking on all-fours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>He lies because it is his nature to lie; he does not speak truth, because the truth is not in him. He sees no harm in lying, because he was educated among people who think a clever lie preferable at all times to a troublesome truth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> And yet, in spite of the natural propensity of Yankeedom to lie, and although they could scarcely avoid it if they were so disposed, the frequency and the enormous character of their lies at this particular juncture argues well for our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>They would undoubtedly tell the truth, let the effort be as painful as it might, could the truth by any means be of service to their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They are always capable of sacrificing feeling to interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>From the appearance of the work it was supposed about <num value="20">twenty</num> men had been engaged in digging the well, had overheard our advanced party and retreated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>It was then determined to discover the enemy's location, and strength by a bold movement, and endeavor to drive them off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Their artillery was next brought into play, and on a signal from their ranks the gunboats also opened upon the little band of Georgians, and they in turn were compelled to evacuate the breastworks they had taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> A great storm has passed over <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>In its wake are ruined fields of grain, stranded boats upon <num value="3">three</num> great rivers, tottering and deserted houses, and at least <measure n="100" type="dead">one hundred dead</measure> bodies, dashed by a wild current against mountain rocks or floating logs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>The works completed by the joint efforts of labor and capital, in a long course of years, have been swept almost out of existence in a single night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>A score of iron furnishes have ceased to scatter their sparks into the air; hundreds of sturdy laborers have been thrown out of employment, and the scenes and incidents which marked the great flood of <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct> have been repeated upon an enlarged scale in <date value="1862-06">June, 1862.</date> In no section has the loss been as heavy as in the <rs type="place">valley of the Lehigh</rs>, although the <rs>Schuylkill</rs> and <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> vied with each other in their rage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> last, the heavens were opened as if to inaugurate a new deluge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>While the torrents swept the streets of the city and filled the sewers, they gradually accumulated in the mountain districts, changed rivulets into miniature rivers, and poured into the <rs>Lehigh</rs>, until its usually coal-black water assumed a muddy hue, and its bosom held the debris of the ruin which it had caused. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/> There is no river east of the <rs>Ohio</rs> that has rendered more service to man than the <rs>Lehigh</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Almost at the point where it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> emerges from the mountains, and assumes it name, it is checked, turned from its course and made a feeder to the canal.--The dams followed each other in succession until near <placeName reg="Easton, Northampton, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2088025">Easton</placeName>, a distance of over <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>The extreme northern dam, it is believed, then gave way. This was at or near <placeName reg="White Haven, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2765907">White Haven</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>The flood of water poured southward, carrying everything before it, and receiving new force and acquiring a new impetus as it over came each obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> The flood rolled on in the dead of night, heralding its progress by a terrible roar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>It tore canal boats from their moorings, and swept them away like feathers, it dashed into the cellars, and mounted to the windows of residences upon its banks; it undermined the walls of towns, and now and then carried off a prize in the form of unlucky sleepers who could not escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>It encroached upon new territory, reaping the waving fields as no scythe could have done, and, in apparent revenge, seized fences and farm vehicles, and conveyed them to places unknown to man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/> The storm spread along the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>The water actually <hi rend="italics">rose <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>.</hi> Fires were built at many points, and crowds collected around them, gazing into the black void beyond, and fearing to hear a human cry pierce the dull roar of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>More than <num value="1">one</num> voice was thus raised for help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>A canal boat drifted down, now inclining to <num value="1">one</num> side, and dipping its deck into the river, and again reversing its position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>On it were <num value="6">six</num> men. Their shouts could be distinctly heard, but no aid could be afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>The brief interval in which they passed the gazers was <num value="1">one</num> of horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>The boat struck a rock at the head of an island near <placeName reg="Bethlehem, Northampton, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013416">Bethlehem</placeName> and split asunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The man clung to the wreck, and finally managed, with <num value="1">one</num> exception, to secure a resting place until the morning of <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Before rescue came, they were joined by <num value="5">five</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>It was terribly bruised. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/> There are many islands in the <rs>Lehigh</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The soil is generally fertile, and they are nearly all well cultivated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>A covered bridge led to the main land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>During the night a great crash aroused the <num value="3">three</num> families living upon the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Their only means of escape had been carried away by a bridge which formerly had spanned the stream above, and the <num value="2">two</num> fabrics were now <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>. --There was no boat, and even if there had been, the chances of safely rowing through such a swift current were but slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>How the families passed the night of Wednesday and the morning of Thursday we do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>But when daylight appeared they found many acres of grain and garden transformed into a barren waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>The rich loam had given place to white sand, and fences and barnes had disappeared as if by the touch of a magician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>For their own safety they were indebted to <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> and solid brick walls. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>It was a veteran and stood the shock of the freshet of <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct> without trembling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>When the rush came last week its good reputation made the quiet water below it a harbor for scores of boats, the crews looking over the river, as well as the darkness would permit, at their less fortunate companions, and blessing their luck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Many of them went to bed. The lock gave way. The boats were engulfed in the torrent, and of the sleepers it is believed that at least <num value="50">fifty</num> awoke to find themselves struggling with a giant whose touch annihilated the great world before the days of <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00307" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>The names of these victims will never be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>They were of course, strangers at <placeName key="tgn,2089628" n="1.000 13" reg="mauch chunk, carbon, pennsylvania">Mauch Chunk</placeName>, earning their living by traveling with the boats from place to place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>A number of women were among the lost. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/> The writer here introduces a good deal of detail showing the immensity of the destruction by the flood, and closes as follows: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> It is almost impossible to imagine the devastation caused by the freshet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Every town in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> situated near the river was more or less injured.--No details as to the financial extent of the loss can be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/> The story of a miner from <placeName key="tgn,2089628" n="1.000 13" reg="mauch chunk, carbon, pennsylvania">Mauch Chunk</placeName> was a sorrowful <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>When the water subsided, he started down the valley to learn the fate of his wife and children.
