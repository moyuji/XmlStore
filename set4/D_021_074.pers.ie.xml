<head>Importance of manufacturing labor.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> No statesman can underrate the value of mechanical labor to a State, or endeavor to derogate from is dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>In New York and other countries of brand new aristocracy, absurd upstarts, themselves often descended from mechanics, affect to look down upon labor of all kinds as beneath the dignity of a gentleman ! It is amusing enough to behold the airs of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Tittlebat Titmouses; but, they do not exert influence enough upon society to produce any other effect than to make people laugh at their follies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>That which has made the <rs>North</rs> so powerful, and endowed it with most of the capacity for mischief it is exercising in this war, is its manufacturing and mechanical skill and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>If the <rs>South</rs> had learned years ago to diversify its industry, we should-be in a very different position from the present <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Almost all the difficulties by which we are surrounded, arise from this source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>We have permitted the <rs>North</rs> to manufacture everything for us, instead of manufacturing for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>If we had learned to make everything for ourselves which our necessities required, the blockade, would not have caused as the slightest inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>But all the inconveniences which it entails will be blessings, if they stimulate us to the development of our own industry, and to the permanent establishment of manufactories for every article which our necessities require. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> We have gone over the face of the earth offering our trade and manufactures to any <num value="1">one</num> who would recognize our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Happily, the humiliating proffer has been accepted by nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, we hope, has better things in store for us A nation that depends on any other nation for manufactures, cannier be independent in fact, no matter what it may be in name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>To make <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> our reliance for manufactures, would be simply to make <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> our masters, instead of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>What has made <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> so great and unconquerable?. It is her vast manufacturing resources and energies combined with her commercial wealth and enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>It was this which enabled her to shoulder the enormous load thrown upon her in those vast <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> wars of the last and present century, which crushed other nations like egg-shells, and to rise refreshed and revivified by every combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The South has <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> times the facilities of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for becoming a great manufacturing country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Our innumerable water courses, inexhaustible mineral wealth, gentle climate, and close neighborhood to the great staples of manufacture, give us advantages which no other country possesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>We surpass <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in the single article of coat, which is the corner-stone of her national strength, and in the article of iron there is no nation which surpasses the <rs>Virginia</rs> iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The late <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> fully appreciated its value in the manufacture of cannon, and all its grist guns for the navy are the product of our mines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>They are well-known to be the best guns in the world, and yet, with all our vast coal and iron facilities, our neglect of manufacturing labor has brought us to such a pass that we are compelled to hunt up old iron and use the bells of churches for warlike purposes ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> What we can do, even with limited means, in the way of mechanical labor, has been magnificently illustrated in the construction of the <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.</hi> Behold the wonderful results of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">first Virginia</orgName> effort in naval architecture and take courage ? We must become a manufacturing people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It will be doubly necessary if <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> undertakes to dispense with Southern cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>In that event we can undersell her in her own kingdom and beat her in all the markets of the world. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> Whilst events have compelled us to relinquish the idea that cotton is an absolute monarch, we are not yet willing to abandon the thought that he is at any rate a limited <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:King,Butler,,,:1"><surname>King</surname></persName>, and may yet do much to extricate us from our difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>This, however, depends upon the allegiance of his subjects at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>If they are disloyal, and are willing to sell their <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:King,Butler,,,:1"><surname>King</surname></persName> and country, his kingdom must soon be ended and his sceptre pass away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>We are sorry to hear, upon what we consider a reliable source, that a brisk trade in cotton has been going on from's principal Southern seaport, as many as <num value="20">twenty</num> vessels being engaged in the illicit traffic, that a large amount has found its way over <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>; that a new device has been lately hit upon of selling it to Union men in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, who are accumulating the article in that region to be disposed of to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and that disloyal man in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Alabama</placeName> are openly selling it to the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Such conduct as this is infamous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>It is meaner and falser than Yankeeism a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times, because Yankeeism, although engaged in invasion, and not in defence, will not, with all its love of money, sell us a single article we need, whilst we, who are defending all that men hold dear, for the sake of base greed and Inure, sell that which is the very life-blood of our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> We trust that the speculations of disloyal people in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Alabama</placeName>, and other sections, will soon be put an end to by the operations of our military commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Lat them execute the law of Congress with the utmost vigilance and energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It is the cotton and tobacco of the <rs>South</rs>, and that alone, that the enemy desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>They are more valuable to us than a <num value="100">hundred</num> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The power of the torch which we hold over them is worth far more than the power of the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Burn &mdash; burn &mdash; burn &mdash; wherever it is in danger of falling into the enemy's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>And, whenever the proprietors have not patriotism enough to destroy, let the military have no hesitation in applying the torch at once and thoroughly. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> We are pleased to observe that the city authorities begin to show themselves awake to the importance of strengthening the river defences to this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Our whole energies should be given to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The article lately published from a foreign periodical, describing the barriers by which even the <name>Chinese</name> were able to arrest the progress of a fleet of powerful <name>British</name> gunboats up their rivers deserves to be investigated, so that it may be seen whether it cannot be adapted to the defence of our own river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>This has been from the beginning the avenue to the capital, which, of all others, required most attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Every variety of mesne should be employed in its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The earth works should all be provided with bomb-proof shelters; the obstructions in the channel commanded by batteries on shore, iron-plated gunboats or rafts-constructed to aid in the defence, and such other modes of defence as naval and military experience and ingenuity may suggest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>It is obvious that the enemy will confine himself principally to the water courses, but it is certain that these, at least such of them as are of vital importance, can be made perfectly impregnable to his attacks. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> To &#x0022;lie like a bulletin&#x0022; has long since passed into a proverb, but &#x0022;to lie like a Yankee&#x0022; will henceforth take its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>For the proof of this statement we appeal to the history of the present war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>There is not <num value="1">one</num> single act of the <rs>Southern</rs> people or of their own, whether in the battle field or the council which they have reported as it occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/> Our people are now beginning to feel that we are in the midst of a desperate war. The enthusiasm which has taken hold of the country springs from adversity, and the urgent need which demands from every gallant heart his exertion to save our liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>We can wish them no worse fortune than an early visit from that pestilent invader. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/> Throughout the <rs>South</rs> attention has been directed generally to the question of the coming crop, and thanks to the efforts of the press, persistently exerted, a beneficial result has, I think; been attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>It is a work of much trouble and expense, ordinarily, to change the system of culture which has been adopted after long experience; and until lately, I believe, the planters of the <rs>South</rs> were reluctant to abandon the cotton crop.--The fall of <placeName key="tgn,2031620" n="1.000 10" reg="Donaldson, Marshall, Indiana">Donelson</placeName> and the loss of the great avenue through which the greatest portion of our grain was received, has forced them, however, to take into earnest consideration the question of our support and that of the army, which must be maintained from the resources of the <rs>Cotton States</rs> almost wholly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>It is patent to every <num value="1">one</num> that the usual crop of cotton being planted, would take a vast <sic>ares</sic> away from the grain culture, which, instead of remaining the same as in previous years, should be largely increased, not only to make up the great waste and contingencies of war, but to cover the large tracts takes away from the support of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and others abandoned by their laborers.--This, as long as it was left merely to the patriotism of the planters, unsupported and enforced by the press, would have resulted in no commensurate good, in as much as many would have planted as much more as his neighbor has failed to <unclear>sow</unclear>, and the area being frequently subscribed, a more careful system of culture would have resulted in a crop fully equal to that of average years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>But the absolute necessity, I think, from observation, has been made so apparent, that the cereal crop will be fully up to the required demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Still, the upper portion of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and that portion of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> not invaded, and the whole of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, should devote itself to produce a crop of wheat which will equal the demand of the entire <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The greater portion of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> being unfit for the cultivation of wheat, the farmers of those sections will find themselves more than repaid by the profits resulting from their coming crop.

These estuaries or sounds are accessible by inlets from the sea, and, if not guarded, the ports to which they lead may be reached as successfully by sea, going vessels of light drought through those channels as by a direct sea routs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>That the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> so considered is proved by the fact that the inland set communication between New Orleans and North Charleston and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and, perhaps, other places is dislike to be blockaded by naval forces of that Government. </p>
