<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Our deepest sympathies are with the friends of those glorious men who have fallen in defence of their native land, but who have left behind them a name--<num value="1">one</num> which will be as grand and imperishable as the mountains which they have consecrated with their pure and noble blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> It is now evident, as we have long believe, that the real demonstration against <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is to be made in the <rs>West</rs> by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s</hi> column, which some accounts represent at more than <num value="30000">30,000</num> men.

<head>The militia call.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> The Militia rolls are like the census tables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>They serve only as valuable depositories of information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>From the <num value="1">one</num>, the <rs>Government</rs> may select its subjects of taxation; from the other, its soldiers for the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> system of volunteering has deprived the militia of the practical utility it once had. It has been copied by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> with great success, and that kingdom considers itself impregnable against <name>French</name> invasion from its large and well trained volunteer forces in every county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The British Government has paid much attention to this new service, and the militia system has virtually gone out of use in the kingdom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> Our Government has been very negligent of both services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>It has allowed the militia system to degenerate into a mockery, and it has taken no pains to provide a substitute, by encouraging the volunteer system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The States have relapsed into a criminal negligence on the subject of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>They have left the whole business of arms and the army to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Our own <placeName reg="Virginia Armory">Virginia Armory</placeName> was turned into a flouring mill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Not a gun was manufactured in the <rs>State</rs>, except occasionally a rifle by some gunsmith of the mountains, who had almost forgotten his trade, and who would sometimes make a gun to keep up the recollection of his calling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The only traces of military knowledge and skill remaining in the <name>States</name> were the result of private enterprise and individual talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The people alone kept the military spirit alive; the <rs>State Governments</rs> ignored and neglected it. Volunteer companies would spring up and flourish a while, then they would languish and fall into decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The prospect of war would kindle the flames; the decline of the danger or of the probability, would extinguish them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But for the military schools, which filled the country with good-officers; but for the volunteer companies of the cities, which served the same purpose of the schools in filling the towns with capable commanders of companies; but for the large quantity of arms, which a Southern <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of war</rs>, foreseeing the danger in the distance, ordered into our Southern arsenals; but for the volunteering spirit to which these circumstances gave efficiency, the <rs>South</rs> would have been in as object a state of defencelessness as <placeName reg="Polska" key="tgn,7006366">Poland</placeName> or <placeName reg="Lombardy" key="tgn,7003237">Lombardy</placeName> or <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The federal government on which they relied as their military protector, has turned to be its assailant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> The South owes none of her safety to her militia system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>As a means of active war the militia is perfectly inefficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>It is of value only as a depository of men from which soldiers may be drafted by the <rs>Government</rs>, when they do not volunteer in sufficient numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>That time has not yet come; for vastly more men have volunteered in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> than have been accepted into the service.--Those who have been rejected have been rejected for the want of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>If they would ensure their acceptance into the service, they have only to provide themselves with arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The most practicable source from which these may be obtained, is from the large stock of double-barrel shot guns still in the country.--A bayonet attachment has been invented for this arm, and the use of the <rs>Minnie</rs> ball or the wire buckshot cartridge makes it as efficient as any of the improved arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The country rifle, also, may often be obtained in sufficient numbers to equip a company or <num value="2">two</num> in a county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The use of the <rs>Minnie</rs> instead of the round ball in these, makes them fully as destructive as the famed <placeName reg="Enfield, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2317638">Enfield</placeName> rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Let the volunteers understand this fact: No company will be rejected, but every <num value="1">one</num> promptly received, provided it is armed; and as many as <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> volunteer forces may be raised in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in addition to those now in the field, armed with the weapons we have pointed out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> It is not intended by calling out the militia in the counties of the North-side, to put a stop to the raising of volunteer companies.--These will still continue to be received for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> or for the war, as heretofore; and it is certainly practicable for as many as <num value="1">one</num> additional company for each county to be organized and to be equipped with guns or rifles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The great want of the <rs>Government</rs> is <hi rend="italics">men with arms in hand;</hi> and they prefer companies pledged for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> or for the war, to militia unarmed, undisciplined, and bound to serve only for a brief period of a few days or weeks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> Large preparations are making in different parts of the <rs>South</rs> for the manufacture of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>In a few months there will be no deficiency in this department of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Meantime the want must be supplied by the best substitutes that can be had, and no volunteer companies will be rejected if they possess arms of the species that have been indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The call for the militia is doubtless designed partly for the purpose of bringing out all the available arms of this description which the country <unclear>affds.</unclear> Another object is to promote the volunteer movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>If it does not add to the effective strength of the army in any other way, the call will, we trust, contribute largely to it in encouraging the volunteer movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>There is scarcely a man in the community whose pride does not rebel against a compulsory service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The part of private in a volunteer corps is honorable from the fact that it is a service of choice and not of compulsion. --We therefore hope to see a large impulse imparted to the volunteer movement by the militia, <unclear>cll.</unclear> </p> </div3>

<head>Recognition of Southern Independence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> It is undeniable that the interests of both <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> point to an early recognition of Southern Independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>We have ever had a doubt of this, nor have we seen anything in the course of the <name>Governments</name> and <unclear>ss</unclear> of the <num value="2">two</num> countries, since our troubles commenced, to lead us to question, for <num value="1">one</num> dement, the conclusions we had formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>But undoubtedly this recognition depends upon our own demonstrations of the fact to be recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>If we prove ourselves independent in act, and maintain our independence in such a manner as gives reasonable evidence of the defensive capacity and strength of our Government, we shall be entitled to the recognition, not only of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, but of the whole civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>We cannot expect them, with due regard to their own interests, to act hastily on such a question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>We must make allowance for the difficulty experienced in <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, in obtaining accurate accounts of the real state of things here, and for the necessity of proceeding with extreme caution amid such fogs and darkness as involve the <rs>Western</rs> hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>They have still unexpired a few months' grace from <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName>, and until that interval has terminated, which they may think it wise to employ in observing the whole ground and calculating the chances, we must not expect precipitate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>For our own part, we have been agreeably disappointed in the recognition by both Governments of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> as a belligerent, entitled to all the privileges and benefits arising from that position under the law of nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> The tone of their trading press has been so favorable to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause that it has excited great indignation throughout the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>We are not verdant enough to suppose that this is the result of any peculiar regard for our people, or that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 6" reg="france">France</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> care a dime about <name>South</name> or <name>North</name>, as such; but it is simply an intelligent sympathy with their own interests, which will make itself felt more powerfully hereafter, if we show an ability to vindicate our cause in the field, and establish our own independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> The gods help those who help themselves and we must look to ourselves alone for our salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The most disgraceful exhibition of want of confidence in itself which the <rs>North</rs> has given in this war, is its appeal for the aid and comfort of other nations against a people who have not more than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>What would be thought of a big bully in the street, attacking a little fellow, not half His size, calling upon the crowd around to help him do it, and because they stand by to see fair play, getting into a great passion with them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The natural inference would be that the big fellow was not as brave as he might be, and that the <name>Bantam</name> was better game than the <rs>Shanghai</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Let the <rs>North</rs> call upon foreign nations to help her, but let the <rs>South</rs> look to herself alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>True, we are the smaller and might without derogation to dignity and honor desire foreign aid. But we shall command more of our own respect, the respect of our enemies and of the world; we shall have more reason to be proud of our independence, and certain of its continuance, if we achieve it by our own unaided efforts, than if we looked to foreign powers for succor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> At the same time, the necessities of Christendom will ere long compel the civilized world to break up a blockade which is injuring all mankind except the country against which it is aimed &mdash; the <rs>South</rs>--which it is training to supply its own wants of every kind, and thus become independent of all nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The trade of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> is already suffering sorely, and the determination of the present <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> &#x0022;What do these war gentlemen of the <rs>North</rs> expect?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>We have gone through <num value="1">one</num> after another phase of their plans and prophecies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> uprising of the <rs>North</rs> was to scatter the rebel hordes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>It only strengthened their arms, roused their spirit, and increased their numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It drove <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> into the arms of the <name>Secessionists</name>, and gave the <rs>South</rs> the unity of purpose they had before lacked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> &#x0022;Then we were promised the ability of the <rs>North</rs> to pour such columns of soldiers into the field that all resistance would be overpowered, and bloodshed would be prevented by the hopelessness of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.--But we find ourselves now equalled it not out numbered by the rebels in aims, who have the daring to advance their outposts up to the very line of our camps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> &#x0022;We were assured of the imminent starvation of the entire race of Southerners, and we find them now in the midst of plenty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We were told that they would run from our advancing regiments, and we find them abundantly ready to take advantage of our unskilled leaders and drive us back from their batteries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> &#x0022;Every promise, every expectation of the war <unclear>part</unclear> has thus far proved false, and we stand now in the presence of the solemn truth that this is a great war, no child's play, a war in which men on both sides are skillful, courageous, strong in their confidence of right, and of which the end is far distant, and visible only through the smoke of battle and across fields of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> &#x0022;We hear some men say again that he who shrinks from war, who is willing to make any sacrifice to avoid war, is a traitor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> &#x0022;It is a great mistake to suppose that a bloodhound is a courageous dog. The men who have plunged us into this war, who have hallooed on the people, are men that have wisely stayed at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>And a part of the plan to cover up their own want of courage, is to keep on the cry of war. The rebels in the <rs>South</rs> who planned the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, who advocated it in Congress, and in the newspapers and on the stump, are the men who have taken the field, while the <rs>Northern</rs> editors and Congressmen and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> who opposed compromise, who let us drift into this war, nay, who dragged us into it, are at home making contracts to supply army stores, and shouting &#x0027;traitor&#x0027; at every man who ventures to remind them of the evil they have brought on the country, or suggest the remedy for it.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Journal of Commerce"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>If <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> could be conquered, it would require a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men to hold her by the threat, whilst the long line of the enemy, weakened by every mile it extended, advanced to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, And they would <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> find <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> as hard a nut to crack as <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>They would find no traitors or tories in the old <rs>North State</rs> to give them aid and comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Every man, woman and child in the <rs>State</rs> would be their enemy, and it is a manly, noble race, modest and unpretending, but brave as lions, and true as steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>And, even if that State could be conquered there is <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, the land of volunteers, where a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> such riflemen as met the <rs>British</rs> at New Orleans would be ready to meet the <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>And if <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> were held, the original Cotton States would still be intact, those very States whose staples are the bone for which the <rs>Northern</rs> dog is fighting --they would still be unconquered, and by that time <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would be out of cotton!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>No! This cannot be a short war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The Southern people will burn and destroy their habitations, their crops, and all that is worth having, before they shall fall into an enemy's hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> On this preposterous idea of conquering the <rs>South</rs> in a short time, the <orgName n="Richmond Whig" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi></orgName> speaks as follows: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> &#x0022;The cry for a short war comes up from all the organs of opinion in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> makes this the pretext for his call for <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> men and <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>He wishes to make short work of the war &mdash; to subdue the <rs>South</rs> during the current year, and have peace and trade prevailing before <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> are over &mdash; The absurd creature!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Even if he had the money, (which, thank to the <rs>Lord</rs>, he has not,) it would require more than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> to equip and organize an army of <num value="400000">400,000</num> men. That would be a task beyond the power of any nation in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>But the hope of speedy peace could alone enable <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to hope for an act of amnesty for his perjuries and usurpation from his Rump Congress, to say nothing of the additional men and <num value="1000000">millions</num> required for the prosecution of the war. The bloody <rs>Blair</rs>, the savage <rs>Greeley</rs>, and the ferocious <rs>Raymond</rs>, all harken to the same cry, and call aloud for a short war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Universal bankruptcy must be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Old Scott is ruining everybody by his dilatory proceedings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> &#x0022;These complaints on the part of the enemy should tend to moderate the impatience of our people, and teach us our true policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We know it requires mighty efforts to keep hands off the invaders, and no opportunity to give them a successful blow should or will be neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>But let us bide our time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>These vandals have started this war in the expectation that it would be attended with little danger and much profit, and have a speedy and glorious end. They boasted of their hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men and <num value="1000000">millions</num> of money, and in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, their treasury is bankrupt and their warriors are tired of the sort of laurels they have won. The sport is not so pleasant as they anticipated; and unless they can bring it to a close in a very short time, they threaten to renounce it in disgust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Our time will come bye and bye. They have given us ample provocation for an endless war; and as they have made us parties to it, we have a voice in fixing its term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The requisite amount might not be easily or readily raised by taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The wealth and resources of our country do not consist in money; they consist chiefly in productive capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The ability of a people to maintain wars, depends greatly upon the annual yield of its productive capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>In this particular, perhaps, no people, of the same number in population in the world, are superior to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> Our wealth consists mostly in agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Our products command money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We grow staples of immense value, both intrinsic and extrinsic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>This is especially true of cotton &mdash; it is the great motor of commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Its money value, upon an average estimate, is about <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> of dollars per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>But it exerts a power far above its money value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It puts into operation <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of capital in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, to say nothing of the large amounts lately (and until this war was waged upon us,) in operation by it in the <rs>Northern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> This staple must be had by other nations, by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, especially, or the greatest distress will be felt by the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of their people who are dependent upon it for their daily bread. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> The plan of the <rs>Government</rs> for raising the means to carry on the war, which is submitted to you to-day, is to take a loan from the planters of the nett proceeds of such portion of their crops as they can spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>In other sections, loans on the proceeds of grain and breadstuffs will be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Here, we produce cotton &mdash; our surplus is cotton. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> Should the crop amount in value to the estimate of <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> of dollars, and <num value="0.5">one-half</num> be loaned in this way, the sum of <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars may be put within the control of the <rs>Government</rs>, which, upon the basis of present estimates, would support an army of <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>This process could be kept up for years, if our enemies are so disposed, without serious injuries to our resources; and should Heaven favor us, as heretofore, with seasons &mdash; with the early and the latter rain &mdash; we should have to resort to taxation only to pay the interests on the bonds, and maintain the public credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The interest will have to be paid by taxes; and if the plan proposed by the <rs>Government</rs> is not sustained by the planters, the money will have to be raised by taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Even before this loan can be made available, a tax of <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num>, to meet necessary wants, may have to be levied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> It is believed that the planters could do this without any serious inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>For the proceeds of that portion of their crops so contributed, they will receive Government bonds bearing <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> interest, payable semi-annually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>This they will receive instead of bank bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The subscription is in the following words; [Here <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> read the form of subscription to the loan.] </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> In answer to numerous inquiries, it might be proper to state that these bonds were not intended to answer the purposes of currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>They are not intended to pass as money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Upon their face they are transferable as notes made payable to bearer, but they are unsuited, in inform and size, for a currency or a circulating medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>That is not their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>They are only intended to be given for the surplus of the crop &mdash; that portion which the planter can spare over and above his immediate wants &mdash; that which he is able to lay up instead of vesting in other property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> Whether they will pay debts or not, will depend very much upon the nature of the debts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>All who hold notes upon money lent &mdash; looking to annual interest, will doubtless take Confederate bonds in payment of such debts, and be glad to get them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>For the bonds will bear <num value="0.08">eight per cent</num> interest, instead of <num value="7">seven</num>--and the interest will be paid every <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>.--Those, however, who are in debt, had better <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> see their creditors, and know whether they will take the bonds in payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>On this point it is important that no <num value="1">one</num> should be mistaken; the bonds are not suited or intended as a currency, to meet the ordinary current expenses and debts of the family and plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>And yet, there can be but little doubt that if any <num value="1">one</num> should sell his whole crop for bonds, and should want the money for them, he could easily and readily dispose of them to some person, who will have the money to lend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The entire amount of the money on private loan in the country will soon seek these bonds as an investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The Legislature will, doubtless, at an early day, authorize all trust funds to be vested in these stocks, which will cause a great demand for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> Should the war be a short <num value="1">one</num>, the bonds at no distant day will very certainly command a premium --that is, if we succeed in the war and establish our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>In that alternative, they will be the very best security, and the very best investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The other alternative he did not take into the account &mdash; that is, the contingency of our being beaten in the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Should such a calamity befall us, candor required him to say that the bonds would be worth nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>But even then they would be worth as much as anything else we have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>In that event lands would be worth nothing, plantations would be worth nothing, cotton would be worth nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>So that if we succeed, the bonds will be a good investment; and if we fail, they will be just as good as anything else. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> As to the duration of the war, we could not give them even a probable conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>In every view of the subject, it was a most irrational and unnatural war. Those who were waging it would, upon all reasonable principles, be the greater sufferers from it. They lived by their trade, their commerce, their navigation, their manufactories, all of which they enjoyed chiefly with us. The Northern States sold to the <rs>Southern</rs> not less, perhaps, than <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num> of their products annually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The market is cut off; with that, the resources of their wealth and prosperity are cut off. How long they can stand this, is beyond human ken to divine.--When fanaticism bears sway it is useless for reason to attempt even speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/><num value="1">One</num> thing, however, he thought he could affirm with confidence, and that was, that the war would last until the enemy was whipped and driven from our soil &mdash; and the best way to whip them soon, and drive them from the country and end the struggle, was to send men enough to do it at once, and subscribe money enough to sustain those men in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> He concluded with a compliment to the ladies &mdash; though the topics he had discussed related rather to the action of men, yet women could exert great influence in carrying out the objects of the <rs>Government</rs> in its policy &mdash; the influence of woman was great in any department of life, though wars were not the proper sphere or theatre for them; but even in war their influence held sway over the hearts and spirits of those engaged in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Many a soldier upon the battle field would feel encouraged in the hour of conflict, when he thought that a mother's prayers and the thoughts and hopes of some fair <num value="1">one</num> were following him to the scenes of his trials and his dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>He was proud to say that the men of his native State (<placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6199" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName>) had done their duty and were still willing to do more; and the women, too, have done their part, arduous as it is. In several of the counties the ladies had done nobly in the way of providing garments and comforts for the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>And Old Richmond, too, had acted nobly; <num value="10">ten</num> companies in the field-- nearly <num value="0.5">one-half</num> her voting population &mdash; and others still ready to <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> go &mdash; while the women had done their duty as nobly as the men. This, he felt, was no small compliment to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>But there was still <num value="1">one</num> way more in which they might aid the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Perhaps some of them had been promised a new carriage, a new set of furniture, or some other luxury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Let them say to their husbands, <q>&#x0022;I can do without this now give its maine &mdash; give all you can &mdash; to the cause of your country.&#x0022;</q> He felt sure they would not hesitate to do this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> To the men he would say, that he did not want them to subscribe now &mdash; go home, think over the matter, think of their country, their homes, and their firesides &mdash; think of subjugation --and then do your duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>I know that many gallant men in our army feel extreme uneasiness and anxiety upon this subject; and, while they will not hesitate to perform their duty, be the consequences what they may, yet it will be to them a source of almost inconceivable relief to know that their children will not be permitted to suffer because their parents may have sacrificed their lives in the defence of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>I am well aware, indeed, that some good and brave men have even been restrained from entering the service, because their children will be left in destitution in case of fatal misfortune to themselves. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It would consume too much time and space to enter into the details of the plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>It is sufficient to say that I would cause the <rs>Commissioners</rs> of the <name>Revenue</name> to make out lists of all the married men who have entered the service from their respective districts, together with the number, age and sex of their children; and that in case of the death of any of these men, no matter what their rank, whose children should be left without means of support, and without relatives or friends, able and willing to maintain them, that duty should be assumed by the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>This relief should be administered in such manner and under such regulations as the <name>Legislature</name>, in its wisdom, may deem expedient; and I do not think there will be much difficulty in devising an efficient mode of action. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>But there are many instances in which the courts would not act, and moreover it would be very unfair to cast the whole burden on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Many counties have furnished far more men than others; some unfortunately, have contributed few or none, and it would be grossly unjust to throw upon the more active and forward counties the burden of supporting all the orphans who may be found in their limits, and the number of whom be increased by the very fact that those counties have been most prompt in sustaining the general cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The Common wealth of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ought to assume a part at least, if not the whole of the burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/> Holding the double position of a member of the <name>Legislature</name>, and an humble rank among the defenders of our rights and liberties, it will not seem inappropriate that I should on deavor to initiate this movement; and in my situation I hope I may be pardoned for making my intention known in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>It is not unlikely that I may be prevented from carrying my purpose into execution; but in such an event, the object having been made public, some more wise and experienced legislator will see that it is not neglected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> Believing that a knowledge of the fact that an effort will be made, at least, to secure such a provision as in above indicated, will afford encouragement and comfort to <num value="1000">thousands</num> of brave men, as well as those already engaged in the service as those who are thinking of entering it, I hope that the editors of all newspapers in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will copy this communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/> The following extract from Bottas' History of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution, volume <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, will be read with interest now: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> &#x0022;Amidst the general desolation, the women of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> exhibited an example of more than masculine fortitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>They displayed so ardent, so rare a love of country, that scarcely could there be found in ancient or modern history an instance more worthy to excite surprise and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Far from being offended at the name of rebel ladies, they esteemed it a title of distinction and glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Instead of showing themselves in assemblies, the seat of joy and pleasures, they repaired on board of ships, they descended into dungeons where their husbands, children and friends were in confinement; they carried them consolation and encouragement, <q>&#x0022;Summon your magnanimity,&#x0022;</q> they said <q>&#x0022;yield not to the fury of the tyrants; hesitate not to prefer prison to infamy, death to servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>America has fixed her eyes on her beloved defenders; you will reap, doubt it not, the fruit of your sufferings; they will produce liberty, that parent of all blessings; they will shelter her forever from the assaults of <name>British</name> banditti.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>You are the martyrs of such a cause, the most grateful to Heaven and sacred of men.&#x0022;</q> By such words these generous women mitigated the miseries of the unhappy prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>They would never appear at the balls-or routs that were given by the victors; those who consented to attend them were instantly despised, and dropped by all the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>The moment an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> officer arrived at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> as a prisoner of war, they sought him out, and loaded him with attention and civilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>They often assembled in the most retired parts of their houses to deplore without restraint the misfortunes of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Many of them imparted their noble spirit to their hesitating and wavering husbands; they determined them to prefer a rigorous exile to their interesting families, and death to the sweets of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Exasperated at their constancy, the <rs>English</rs> condemned the most zealous to banishment and contraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>In bidding a last farewell to their fathers, their children, their brothers, their husbands, those heroines, far from betraying the least mark of weakness, which in men might have been excused, exhorted them to arm themselves with intrepidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>They conjured them not to allow fortune to vanquish them, nor to suffer the love they bore their families to render them unmindful of all they owed their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>When comprehended, soon after, in the general decree of banishment issued against the partisans of liberty, they abandoned with the same firmness their natal soil A supernatural alacrity seemed to animate them when they accompanied their husbands into distant countries, and even when immured with them in the fetid ships, into which they were inhumanly crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Reduced to the most frightful indigence, they were seen to beg bread for themselves and families Among those who were nurtured in the lap of opulence, many passed suddenly from the most delicate and the most elegant style of living to the rudest triumph over their resolution and cheerfulness, their example was a support to their companions in misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>To this heroism of the women of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>, it is principally to be imputed that the love, and even the name of liberty, were not totally extinguished in the <rs>Southern</rs> provinces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The <rs>English</rs> hence began to be sensible that their triumph was still far from secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>For, in every affair of public interest, the general opinion never manifested itself with more energy than when women take part in it with all the life of their imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Less powerful as well as less stable than that of men when calm, it is far more vehement and pertinacious when roused and inflamed.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Bottas' History of the American Revolution"></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
