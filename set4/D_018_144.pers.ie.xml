<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> It is also to be remarked that the slaveholding States of the <rs type="place">Valley of the Mississippi</rs>, by their position on the banks of a great stream assigned by <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> as a common avenue of commerce for themselves and other powerful communities, inhabiting its upper parts and having dissimilar domestic institutions, could never lightly regard a severance of the <rs>Union</rs> by such a line &mdash; an event which would bring with it to them inevitable conflicts and the danger of national controversies and wars, as is abundantly proved by the history of the river, when its mouth was held by an independent and foreign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>While these States, therefore, are sensitively alive to whatever affects the security of their domestic institutions, or jeopards their equal constitutional rights in the <rs>Union</rs>, and are ready at all times to make every sacrifice to defend them, as the <name>States</name> commonly called the <rs>Border Slave States</rs> also are, they are yet not smitten &mdash; any more than these Border States--with a passion for disunion for its own sake, or disposed to rush into it heedlessly and unnecessarily. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>As these were the terms, well understood on all sides, on which they came into the <rs>Union</rs>, so they are the only terms, consistent with honor or justice or self-respect, on which they can be expected to remain in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The justice and reasonableness of such a demand, urged with the solemn earnestness and dignity which the occasion imports, cannot fail to be heeded, if not by all, by the major or most important part of our confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> has already given her answer, in advance, to such an appeal, by her vote in the <name>Presidential</name> election; and although <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> voted differently in that contest, it must be borne in mind that there were issues supposed to be involved in the election, affecting the peculiar interests of her industrial system, which, doubtless, mainly influenced her vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Whenever an issue shall be distinctly presented on the preservation, by her good faith and loyalty, of that Union, of which it is her proudest boast to be regarded as the key-stone, no <num value="1">one</num> conversant with her history can doubt where <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> will be found. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Nor can I doubt, when the day of solemn decision shall arrive, that the powerful Northwestern States--taken out of the side of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, whose children are still widely diffused among their bold and enterprising population &mdash; bordering, as they do, on <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, as well as on <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; and having a common interest with the slaveholding States occupying the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName> in the use of that great Mediterranean channel of intercourse and trade, will rally with those States, cordially and frankly, to a Union of equal rights, of justice and fraternity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> When we turn our eyes again to the <name>Eastward</name>, we cannot doubt on what side will be found the imperial city, the centre of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> industry and commerce &mdash; in herself a sovereign power &mdash; with all her vast connected interest and dependencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>If to the internal questions now agitating the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>--many of them deeply affecting the rights and interest of the city &mdash; be added the supreme <num value="1">one</num> of a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, it is not an improbable event, amid the revolutions of empire, that we should see the <rs>Southern</rs> portion of the <rs>State</rs>, comprehending the city, separate from the rest, and formed into a new and independent State, finally adhering to the central States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, slaveholding and non-slaveholding, with those of the <rs type="place">Valley of the Mississippi</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/> Owing to my being in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> last night, I am not fully posted to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/> While the moderate <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> are disposed to compromise, the extremists are very indignant at what they call &#x0022;Southern impudence,&#x0022; thinking that any concessions made to mere impudence will only encourage it to make still further demands.

<head>A beautiful Devil,<lb/><hi rend="italics">(concluded.)</hi></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> &#x0022;In bed!&#x0022; she exclaimed; &#x0022;I hope you are not worse!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> He made no answer, but Servin, in a whisper, told her that his master had suddenly become very ill, and that perfect quiet would be necessary for him. During <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> Angelique waited on her husband, who remained in bed; but, do what she would, Servin was not to be got rid of. If she desired him to fetch anything, he had it at hand in a closet, or rang for another servant, saying that the doctor had ordered him never to leave his master for an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>On the evening of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day, the valet had gone to the cupboard for something, and the <rs>President</rs>, fancying him still there, asked for a glass of <hi rend="italics">can <unclear></unclear>.</hi> Angelique flew to a table mixed the drink, and added to it something from a little bottle, which she hastily replaced in the bosom of her dress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> The glass was suddenly taken from her hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/><num value="0.5">A half</num>-stifled scream betrayed her terror; but Servin, dispensing with all ceremony, led her from the room, and closing the chamber door behind them, said sternly-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/> &#x0022;This cannot last longer, <rs type="role2">Madame</rs>; you have put something by mistake into my master's <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">can sucree.</hi></foreign> I must learn from the physician what it is. <measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> ago you made a similar mistake with <rs type="role2">Monsieur</rs>'s broth; but as it was Fifine who drank it, that did not so much matter, except that Fifine is dead, poor thing!&#x0022; She did not answer, but steadying herself against the balustrade of the staircase, looked at the valet with dissented eyes. &#x0022;<rs type="role2">Madame</rs> sees that to preserve my master from such accidents in future it is necessary that I should ask the physician what is here,&#x0022; continued Servin, touching the glass. &#x0022;But it would simplify matters amazingly if <rs type="role2">Madame</rs> would be so obliging as to give me the phial which is in the folds of her dress.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> &#x0022;You will not betray me?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/> &#x0022;On <num value="1">one</num> condition, <rs type="role2">Madame</rs>, I will not. You must leave the care of my master altogether to me. The fatigue is too much for you, and you make nervous mistakes which might be fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>In future, I shall make the drinks, and, further, you will give me that bottle, which I shall set carefully aside, with this glass, lest, in an unhappy moment of forgetfulness, something might occur which would render it necessary for me to produce them.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> He had scarcely spoken when she dashed the glass from his hand, and the contents, mingled with the scattered fragments, fell through the balustrades, and dropped on the staircase beneath them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> <q>I promise what you ask,&#x0022;</q> she said, with a flash of triumph in her eyes. &#x0022;The phial contains only an eye-wash.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> The valet shook his head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/> &#x0022;You cannot come into my master's chamber again, <rs type="role2">Madame</rs>; if you do--&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> He paused, and returned to the <rs>President</rs>, who had seen the beginning of the affair, and who now sat up in the bed trembling with anxiety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> &#x0022;Again?&#x0022; he asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> &#x0022;Again; but I have explained to <rs type="role2">Madame</rs> that she must come here no more.&#x0022; The wretched old <rs type="role2">President</rs> cast himself down on the pillow, moaning. &#x0022;Calm yourself, <rs type="role2">Monsieur</rs>,&#x0022; said the valet; &#x0022;I will not say anything of this unless it should become necessary.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> made no reply, and Servin proceeded to arrange the room for the night: taking his own place in an arm-chair beside the bed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/> The night wore on, and when the old man fell asleep at about midnight, Servin felt inclined to follow his example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>Yet an undefiled fear warned him to be watchful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>He arose from the chair and moved about the room, opening the curtains and gazing out into the dark and stormy night; he stirred the fire and placed himself beside it, trimming the lamp and taking up a book; but he could hear Angelique, whose apartment adjoined that of her husband, moving cautiously about, and he was unable to fix his attention on the pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Presently the sounds in her chamber ceased; nothing was to be heard save the moan of the wind without, and the crackling of the fresh wood he had piled on the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>He felt that the desire to sleep was overcoming him, and casting about for means of rousing himself, it occurred to him to make some coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>Noiselessly opening the door, he listened for a moment at Angelique's door; all was still there; he peered through the keyhole, but there was no light within, except from the flicker of her dying fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Feeling that all was safe, he returned to his master's chamber, and taking a light, trod carefully along the corridor, and down the staircase to the lower story, to get the articles he needed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> Scarcely had he reached the lowest step when Angelique's door opened without a sound, and she looked over the balustrades at him; she had either been in bed, or was ready for bed, for a long white night dress was her only covering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>She entered her husband's room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Approaching the table on which his drink for the night was set, she removed the stopper from the carafe, and poured into it the whole contents of a bottle she carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>At this moment she heard Servin approaching; he was ascending the stairs, she saw the reflection from the light he carried on the ceiling of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>She could not regain her chamber unobserved, but remembering that she had pulled her door close as she came out, she darted toward a large closet in her husband's room, lined with fixed wardrobes, and opening the door of <num value="1">one</num> of these, stepped lightly in. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> She had scarcely shut the door upon herself when Servin entered the outer room and shut himself in. She drew before her some of the garments which hung from the pegs, and cautiously settling herself into an endurable position, could hear Servin making and drinking his coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Presently <persName n="Tiquet,Monsieur,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00451" reg="mostcommon:Tiquet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Monsieur">Monsieur</roleName> <surname>Tiquet</surname></persName> began to mumble indistinctly, and to loss his arms and head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Anon the mutterings became incoherent, sharply-uttered words; at length a fierce delirium came on. Servin took his master's hand: it was like fire to the touch.--The sick man called for drink, and Servin, who had taken especial care in the preparation, hastened to give him some &mdash; but to his surprise found the stopper out of the carafe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> Now he distinctly knew that he had replaced this stopper, a slight circumstance had impressed the fact on his mind; it had fallen from his hand upon the table, and had made a noise which had startled his master from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sleep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/> He laid down the half-filled glass and filled another with pure water, which the <rs>President</rs> drank eagerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Then, going into the corridor, Servin went to Angelique's door; it was closed, but not latched, and yielded to his touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>The fire was nearly out when he looked in, but, as his eyes became used to the half-twilight, he saw that the coverings were turned down, and the bed unoccupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>He called his mistress, supposing she might be in the dressing-room, but when no answer was returned he came back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>He was sure that Angelique had entered her husband's chamber while he was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> absent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>He looked under the heavy valiance of the bed, and examined every portion of the furniture under or behind which she might be. Last of all, he went to the closet, and, as if by instinct, pulled open the leaf of the wardrobe and drew aside the <rs>President</rs>'s robe of office, under which the guilty woman lay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/> Her eyes met his, and without a word she rose and stepped from her hiding-place to the floor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> &#x0022;<rs type="role2">Madame</rs>, you have broken the agreement.--You cannot blame me if I now take measures to prevent any injury either to my master or myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>You must not leave this room till the physician, for whom I shall instantly send, shall have decided whether or no there be poison in the carate, the stopper of which I know was put in by me, but which I found lying on the table.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> The most abject entreaties succeeded Angelique's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speechless terror, but Servin was deal to her prayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>In the rage which quickly supervened, when she flung herself on him in her endeavors to escape, her strength was no match for his; yet the struggle was long before he at last got her into the closet, which had no window, and there locked her in. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> As soon as he had done that he proceeded to awaken <num value="1">one</num> of the men-servants and sent him for the physician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>His master was alarmingly worse; his thin voice was raised in fearful screams; his whole frame was agitated by vain struggles to get up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> &#x0022;Did you dare to kill my beautiful wife?&#x0022; he asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/> &#x0022;Lie down, <rs type="role2">Monsieur</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>I assure you that <rs type="role2">Madame</rs> is safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>She prefers to await the doctor's opinion in your wardrobe closet; she is too much agitated to come near your bed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> stared at him, as if trying to comprehend his words, and then, with a heavy sigh, sank back exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Dawn was breaking when the doctor arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attended to the patient, who was quiet though still wandering in mind, he listened while Servin detailed his suspicious and the causes which had aroused them, and finally produced the carafe, filled with clear amber fluid, at the bottom of which a white sediment had settled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> By noon on the ensuing day all <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> was in a ferment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>The intelligence was in every mouth that <persName n="Tiquet,Madame,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00452" reg="mostcommon:Tiquet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <surname>Tiquet</surname></persName>, for an attempt upon her husband's life, was in prison and awaiting trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>The <rs>Chevalier Mongeorge</rs>, also, who had been until near <time value="12am">midnight</time> at the <rs type="place">Hotel</rs> Tiquet, was under arrest, and so was Angelique's maid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>The girl had in her terror confessed all she knew, which was not a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>She declared that her mistress had frequently gone, accompanied by her, to the cabaret of Cattelain, whence she brought sometimes powders, sometimes liquids, which she told the girl were cosmetics that Cattelain's mother taught him to prepare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>But the woman had watched, and had seen her mistress put portions of these things into the food of an Angora cat, and into the drinking vessels of birds; and they had all died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion the girl had been about to drink some soup which stood in a bowl on her mistress' table, but had only taken <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> mouthfuls, when the lady came in, and was greatly enraged: throwing away the remaining contents of the basin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>The maid was terribly ill for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>At another time Angelique </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/> had sent her to Cattelain's with a sealed letter, on receipt of which the man had delivered her a bottle which was the <num value="1">one</num> now produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>It had been full when she gave it to her mistress; now it was empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Cattelain had said to her, &#x0022;Be discreet, and you do not know what a great lady you yet may be. Some day, soon, that old <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> Tiquet will die, and I shall marry <rs type="role2">Madame</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>We shall find you a good husband with money.&#x0022; She had believed him to be jesting, and had laughed; on which he had seemed angry, and told her to make haste home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/> When she gave the bottle to her mistress, the latter had kissed it, and said, &#x0022;I have herewith to punish all my enemies and make myself free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Have a care that you do not offend me.&#x0022; The girl had then asked her mistress what the phial contained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>On which she replied, &#x0022;Enough to prevent half a dozen men from ever feeling a headache again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Something to cure <persName n="Tiquet,Monsieur,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00453" reg="mostcommon:Tiquet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Monsieur">Monsieur</roleName> <surname>Tiquet</surname></persName>'s asthma and jealousy at <num value="1">one</num> draught.&#x0022; This had occurred <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> ago. She said she had been afraid to tell, although she knew that it was poison that Cattelain had sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>On the day after the scene above described, she said to her mistress that she thought she must tell some <num value="1">one</num> of what she knew, for it lay heavy on her conscience; on which Angelique had made her swear to keep it secret; telling her that if she did not do so she should have some of the poison herself; and that if she told, she would bring punishment on her own head, for she was now, in the eyes of the law, as criminal as herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>This, she said, had kept her silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>On her deposition Cattelain was arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>In his house were found poisons of various kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>In <num value="1">one</num> bottle, from which she said he had poured what he had given her, was a preparation of arsenic and aconite, which the physician who attended the <rs>President</rs> declared to be the same that was contained in the carafe of night drink. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/> Angelique, who quite recovered her audacity and self-possession, resisted all entreaties to confess her crime, avowing that nothing should induce her to falsely condemn herself and cast a stigma on her child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>She declared that the whole charge was a conspiracy between Servin and her maid, who had an intrigue together; that Servin had ruled his master before marriage, was jealous of her influence, and had taken this method of getting rid of her. The torture by water was applied to her, but she bore its agony with firmness.--In the same chamber Cattelain was stretched on the rack, and for some time bore the torture without flinching; but as greater force was applied, he yelled, and made a full confession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>He avowed that <rs type="role2">Madame</rs> had promised to marry him when her husband should be dead, and that as he himself was jealous of Mongeorge, he had meant to poison that person as soon as he could find an opportunity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/> It was plain that Mongeorge, who had been arrested, was only guilty in his love for Angelique, and he was at once set free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>He immediately repaired to the <rs type="place">Hotel</rs> Tiquet, and enforced admittance to the <rs>President</rs>, who was restored to his senses, though prostrate with shame and grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>To him Mongeorge confessed that he loved Angelique, and swore never again to see her it her husband would aid him to endeavor to procure her pardon.--<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> agreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>His passion for his wicked wife was strong, and Mongeorge drew up in his presence a petition, which he signed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Then the chevalier departed to seek audience of the <rs>King</rs>, with whom he was a favorite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/> It was of no avail; the <rs>King</rs> was kind in manner, but inflexible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>The crime of poisoning had fearfully increased, and he was advised most urgently to punish the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> poisoner who could be brought to justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Moreover, Mongeorge's relatives, who were of great consideration, having learned that the chevalier was about to intercede for Angelique, had been beforehand with him, and had besought that the law might be enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Pitying the young man's despair, the <rs>King</rs> again sent him from <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00454" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, that he might not be in the way to witness Angelique's trial and execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Perforce, Mongeorge departed; but in a few days an old man, emaciated almost to a skeleton, his hair white, his limbs tottering, and supported by a grey-haired valet, demanded audience of the <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>The petitioner held by <num value="1">one</num> hand a lovely little girl, and, on being presented to the <rs>King</rs>, knelt, and made his little daughter, kneeling also, join her tiny hands in supplication for her mother's life.--The <rs>King</rs> raised him and embraced the child, but assured him that pardon was hopeless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/> The day of trial came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The most untroubled innocence could not have displayed an eye more cloudless, a brow more unruffled, than Angelique's. Her matchless tresses were fully displayed, being arranged in clusters of heavy long curls, crowned with a chaplet of white roses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Sentence of death was passed on all <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The waiting-maid was pardoned in consideration of her voluntary confession, but condemned to retire for life to the convent of St. Agatha.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Cattelain managed to drag himself to the feet of his mistress and implore her pardon for having criminated her. &#x0022;I forgive you, my poor Cattelain,&#x0022; she said; &#x0022;it was pain which forced you to belie yourself and me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>To add to the dramatic effect of her trial, by a strange coincidence it happened that the <rs>Judge</rs> who condemned her was her former lover, <persName n="St. Chaubert,,Henri,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00456" reg="expanded:St. Chaubert, Chaubert.Henri,,,"><foreName>Henri</foreName> <surname>St. Chaubert</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Dressed as she had been at her trial, and accompanied by her aunt and Cattelain, and attended by a priest who vainly implored her to confess, she was borne on a cart through the streets of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, exposed to the gaze of <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>She bore it unmoved, and her sole anxiety seemed to be that her lovely hair should not be wrested out of curl by a slight rain that was falling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The smallest lock of her hair sold for a large sum.
