<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>These events are important in themselves and in their probable consequences; they require, therefore, to be examined more in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The fight on the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> may be dismissed without remark; it was simply a skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The serious work begins on the <dateStruct value="--8"><day reg="2">8th</day></dateStruct>, and begins in this way: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName>'s advance consisted wholly of cavalry, whereof there were <num value="3">three</num> brigades, numbering <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men. Aware that they had an enemy in their immediate front &mdash; they had been engaged the day before &mdash; <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> allowed them to push on without an infantry support and with the whole of their train, consisting of <num value="300">300</num> wagons.--There was but <num value="1">one</num> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>In response to a report, on the the morning of the <dateStruct value="--8"><day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct>, that the cavalry had been checked and were hard pressed by an infantry force in front, <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> sent forward <num value="2">two</num> divisions of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 13">13th army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>These <num value="2">two</num> divisions &mdash; being less than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the whole army &mdash; were precipitated <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> beyond the nearest portion of the main body, and arriving in front of the enemy were vigorously attacked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The cavalry, in whose support they had came up, fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The infantry were outnumbered, flanked, beaten, and attempted to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The road by which alone the artillery could move was blocked by the wagon train of the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>A scene of wild confusion, panic, and finally litter rout, followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/><num value="20">Twenty</num> guns were captured by the enemy. &#x0022;The roads were so blocked up, &#x0022; says an artillery officer, &#x0022;that the order was given to cut the traces and save themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The retreat by this time had become a rout&#x0022; When it had continued for a long distance, the pursuit of the enemy was checked by the arrival of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 19">19th corps</orgName> and of night From the ground on which the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 19">19th corps</orgName> had taken its stand, <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> ordered a retreat to <placeName reg="Pleasant Hill, Talbot, Georgia" key="tgn,2023942">Pleasant Hill</placeName>, which was effected during the darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The causes of this disaster were that <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> suffered the cavalry to advance beyond easy supporting distance; that the cavalry train was suffered to get in front of the whole infantry force, and so prevented the use of the only road for troops or artillery to advance or retreat; and that when <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> decided to deliver battle, instead of withdrawing his cavalry, he committed to that engagement against the whole body of the enemy but a small part of his own force, and sent that, as he had previously done the cavalry, out of reach of the remaining infantry, by whose aid the battle could have been won. It is remarkable that he here committed exactly the error by which, in <date value="1864-08">August, 1862,</date> he lost the <rs n="Battle of Cedar Mountain" type="battle">battle of Cedar Mountain</rs> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Skirmishing occupied the greater part of the day About <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, the enemy attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The force of his onset was received by the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 16">Sixteenth Army Corps</orgName>, under <persName n="Smith,,Gen,Andrew,Jackson," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="default:Smith,Gen,Andrew,Jackson,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <foreName>Andrew</foreName> <foreName>Jackson</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Partially successful at some points, the enemy captured the whole of a battery, and pressed on. Received at close quarters, with a very deadly discharge of artillery and musketry their final charge along the line was repulsed; the battery was retaken, and the rebels were driven from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>It appears, however, that the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 13">13th Army Corps</orgName>, of which <num value="2">two</num> divisions had been sacrificed the day before, was able to take no part in this battle, and that the losses of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 19">19th Army Corps</orgName> had also been heavy on the <dateStruct value="--8"><day reg="2">8th</day></dateStruct>, and that the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 16">16th Army Corps</orgName> now, although victorious, suffered heavily from the desperate fighting of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> So that, upon the whole, <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName>, on the morning of the <date value="04-10">10th of April,</date> found his army in that condition in which it seemed to him advisable to decline further contest with the rebel force under <persName n="Smith,,Gen,Kirby,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="default:Smith,Gen,Kirby,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and to retreat He fell back from <placeName reg="Pleasant Hill, Talbot, Georgia" key="tgn,2023942">Pleasant Hill</placeName> to Grand Encore, a distance of <measure n="35miles" type="distance">thirty-five miles</measure> The enemy had been so severely repulsed on the evening of the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> that they seemed to have been unable &mdash; or possibly, for another reason, unwilling &mdash; to pursue the retiring forces of <persName n="Banks,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="default:Banks,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName>; and the march to Grand Encore was accomplished without molestation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The safety of the latter is perhaps compromised, and if he is attacked and beaten, his defeat will add <num value="1">one</num> more to the many examples of the impolicy of seeking to unite in the face of the enemy <num value="2">two</num> columns marching from different points by converging lines. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> Amidst the many accounts of the capture of <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>, by which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondents are essaying to horrify and inflame the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, there is <num value="1">one</num> very calm and apparently truthful statement of that affair in the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName>.</hi> This was from a correspondent of that paper at <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>He says: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> &#x0022;The storming of <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> was a serious affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>I convert and with an intelligent freshman who came up on the steamer that brought many of our wounded men to <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He tells me that our officers placed their negro soldiers in front of the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>They immediately ran away, and the whites surrendered as soon as the rebels entered the lort, calling on the negroes to do the same, but they not understanding matters, and being afraid of falling into the hands of the rebels, ran away with their arms and occasionally fired on the pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>But all who surrendered, whether <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>, were protected as soon as the <hi rend="italics">meles</hi> of the assault was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>A few negro women and children were killed in the fort, and some of the negroes were pursued down to the edge of the river and killed before the rebel officers could control their men. The demoralization of the white and terror of black soldiers was excessive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The negroes do not know enough to give up, and their officers lost all control over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The passion and rage of the rebels were ungovernable at meeting the negroes in arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> &#x0022;After the surrender the rebel officers, with a few exceptions, did what they could to control their men. It was worse than folly to attempt a defence with negro troops, unless there was certainty of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>They could expect nothing if the defence lifted from the rebels, who, entering the fort sword in hand, would probably refuse quarter, which I am informed the laws of war permit in cases where a place is taken by assault.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Journal of Commerce"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> This unfolds another chapter of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> philanthropy towards the poor negro, who, after all, is the greatest sufferer by this war. The negro soldiers were placed &#x0022;in front of the whites.&#x0022; Poor devils, they immediately ran away, and, firing upon their pursuers, compelled them to inflict the punishment upon them which they received.--We have very little doubt that the statement here given is correct, and that <persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00264" reg="nearbymention:Forrest,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName> did not exercise the privilege accorded to him by civilized warfare, of refusing quarter &mdash; a failure which many at the <rs>South</rs> will regret. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> Yet the hullabaloo raised over <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> in the <rs>North</rs> is subserving a purpose. --<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00265" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> needs a sensation to help him on at this time, and it comes in opportunely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>We observe, too, that it has been applied to a practical purpose in another way. By the confession of a correspondent of the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName>, (a loyal <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> paper,) it appears that there has been some malicious shooting of Southern prisoners at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> by <hi rend="italics">negro</hi> guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>But the same authority says that the matter is to be looked into &mdash; we suppose with &#x0022;quiet vehemence:&#x0022;a sort of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> energy spoken of by <num value="1">one</num> of their letter writers recently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>This investigation was to be made by the <name>Provost</name> of the <rs type="place">Point</rs>, and if it was found that the shooting was malicious, the offenders were to be &#x0022;punished;&#x0022; if not, they were to be &#x0022;reprimanded, &#x0022; we suppose &#x0022;severely,&#x0022; as was <persName n="Long,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Long,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Long</surname></persName> in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>At all events, it appears from this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> letter writer that we rebels were to learn from the measures taken towards these black murderers that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> does not mean to allow &#x0022;excesses on defenceless prisoners,&#x0022; as in &#x0022;the horrid affair at <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>.&#x0022; Decidedly not. Negroes and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with arms in their hands at the <rs>Fort</rs> are as defenceless as are rebels in prison without arms; aye, and if not, how dare we rebels in insurrection to kill the <rs>Union</rs> soldiers, who, according to <persName n="Colfax,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="mostcommon:Colfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Colfax</surname></persName>, are lawfully engaged in enforcing the authority of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in its own territory!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It is very adroit in the letter writer to introduce <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> in connection with the murders perpetrated at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Pleasant indeed is it to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, to contemplate it just there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The spirit of cowardly revenge could find no more happy indulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Behold the provost censuring severely the black murderers for their &#x0022;carelessness&#x0022; in shooting those rebels, and &mdash; after telling them they ought to be ashamed of themselves &mdash; turning himself in triumph towards the rebels, he exclaims; &#x0022;See how we punish these wretches for their &#x0027;carelessness!&#x0027; The Government does not allow &#x0027;excesses on defence less prisoners!&#x0027;--and thus it gives an example so different from <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>!&#x0022; How amiable!--how innocent!--<persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> and <placeName reg="Plymouth Rock, Franklin, New York" key="tgn,2588760">Plymouth Rock</placeName> itself must be agitated gratefully and joyfully, by such an example &mdash; such. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> The paragraph from the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs></hi> we copy below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>It will be agreeable reading to rebel soldiers, whose manners these <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> seem to be determined to mend, if not by reprimanding negro murderers, at least by &#x0022;diminishing rebel ranks&#x0022; in some very mysterious way!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>What that may be does not appear; but beyond doubt it is not meant to be done in the battle-field! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> During the past week several of the prisoners were accidentally or maliciously shot by the negro guards on duty around and within the camp, receiving each a slight wound, <num value="1">one</num>, however, receiving a severe wound in the foot, lodging the ball in the region of the tarsal bones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>This had the effect to start an inquiry by our worthy <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs> into the cause of these so frequent occurrences.--We understand he has already arrested several officers of the guard, who were on duty when these occurrences took place &mdash; it being his desire to at once punish the offenders of these acts, when done with malicious intent &mdash; if through carelessness, then reprimand the offenders thereby showing to the rebel authorities that the <rs>Government</rs> does not allow any excuses on defenceless prisoners, giving them an example of a different sort from the torrid affair at <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>, where whites and blacks, woman and children, were butchered in cold blood and thrown in <num value="1">one</num> common grave together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>This cruel act is not approved of by the <unclear></unclear> to their honor, let it be said &mdash; but should such acts be repeated, will have the effect to diminish the ranks of a cause which keeps itself <unclear></unclear> by murder and butchery. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
