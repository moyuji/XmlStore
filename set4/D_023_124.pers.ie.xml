<head><placeName reg="The Missouri">The Missouri</placeName> massacre.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> The article which we published yesterday with regard to this matter, was written a week ago, before any action had been taken by the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Its publication was unavoidably delayed until there had already appeared an order to <persName n="Holmes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> directing him to require the surrender of the murderer <rs>McNeil</rs>, or in the event of refusal, to execute <num value="10">ten</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> officers of the enemy that should fall into his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>This order had escaped our notice; yet we do not know that it would have altered our opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>In the first place, <persName n="McNeil,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="mostcommon:McNeil,nomatch:0"><surname>McNeil</surname></persName> executed with every circumstance of horror, <num value="10">ten</num> honest men for <num value="1">one</num> man not known to be dead, and described by the <name>Abolition</name> papers as a spy. It would have been but even-handed justice to have meted out the exact measure with which he measured <persName n="Holmes,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="default:Holmes,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> should have been ordered to execute <num value="10">ten</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers for every man murdered by <persName n="McNeil,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="mostcommon:McNeil,nomatch:0"><surname>McNeil</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>In the second place, there should have been no contingency in the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/><persName n="Glass,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="mostcommon:Glass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Glass</surname></persName>, in her directions as to the mode of cooking a hare, says <q>&#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all catch a hare.&#x0022;</q> She would hardly have given this sage direction had she been sure that every <num value="1">one</num> who might wish to avail himself of her culinary skill had a hare ready caught for the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/><persName n="Holmes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> like the readers of <persName n="Glass,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="mostcommon:Glass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Glass</surname></persName>'s book, is to <q>&#x0022;catch his hare.&#x0022;</q> In other words, he is to capture his officers before he can shoot them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>How if he should never catch them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Is this damnable crime to remain forever unpunished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It is understood that there are always officers, and a plenty of them in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Why not constantly retaliate upon them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>In the third place, as matters stand at present, nothing is easier than for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to elude all punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It will only be necessary to disavow the act, and then the precedent of the <rs>Pope</rs> case may be pleaded &mdash; That miscreant when he set out on his foray upon the <placeName reg="Piedmont, Augusta, Virginia" key="tgn,2113636">Piedmont</placeName> region published an <hi rend="italics">order</hi> by which he delivered up the whole country to pillage &mdash; He declared, in so many words, that he would not protect the inhabitants against murder, rape arson, and pillage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>In reply the <rs>President</rs> issued an order subjecting his officers, when captured, to imprisonment, there to expect the punishment of banditti.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The march began, and the whole country become a scene of robbery murder, house burning and horrors of every description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Finding that he was about to be annihilated by our army, the rascal withdrew his order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Forthwith our retaliatory order was withdrawn, and all the officers we had captured dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/><hi rend="italics">Our</hi> order, it seems, was issued against <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s order The <hi rend="italics">order</hi> was the thing armed at not the <hi rend="italics">crimes committed</hi> under that order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Our Government is a wonderful abstractionist, and contrived so completely to slip the necks of <placeName><persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s office</placeName>rs out of the halter that they laughed at its fulminations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It is clear enough that no retaliation will be made for the <rs>Missouri</rs> massacre unless the army take the matter into its own hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> We cannot and we do not suspect the <rs>Government</rs> of any intention to palter with the people; yet persons less charitably disposed than we profess to be, will be sure to say that if there were any real intention to retaliate upon the enemy it should have been done at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>There was no occasion for any other order than <num value="1">one</num> to the proper officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>commanding him to select a certain number of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers of the highest rank in our hands, and to execute them with the proper formalities.--There is no other means left us to deal with an enemy who is deaf alike to the voice of reason and of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The beast <rs>Butler</rs>, but the other day, when he was informed that <persName n="Taylor,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> would retaliate for the barbarous act of burning <placeName reg="Bayou Sara, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2644428">Bayou Sara</placeName>, replied that in that event he should go on hanging among the citizens of New Orleans until he had satisfied himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>He would not have dared to make such a threat had he not believed that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> had not the hardihood to retaliate for anything he might do </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
