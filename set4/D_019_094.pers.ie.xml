<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Our mountain town is more quiet since the leaving of the various volunteer companies of which I wrote you. But the enthusiasm among the people is on the increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Another volunteer company, making the <orgName type="regiment" key="4VolunteerCompany">fourth volunteer company</orgName> of the place, is now being raised by <persName n="Peyton,Colonel,John,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Peyton,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Peyton</surname></persName>, who will drill them <foreign lang="fre">a la Zouave.</foreign> Our armory is used every night now for drilling purposes, and our militia seem determined to have whatever benefit there may be in good training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>These drills are really pleasant re-unions, and an amount of good fellowship prevails that is unusual any where in times of <q>&#x0022;piping peace.&#x0022;</q> Set that down as <num value="1">one</num> of the benefits of war, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> <num value="1">One</num> of our town papers (the <hi rend="italics">Vindicator</hi>) is suspended, the hands being <q>&#x0022;off to the war.&#x0022;</q> I learn that the <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi> is likely to suspend from a similar cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> I wrote you of the young ladies making bandages and lint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The ladies at large are now about engaging in the manufacture of tents and clothing for the new companies.--Our <num value="2">two</num> regular volunteer companies were well provided by the ladies with tents some months ago. How to make a tent was the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>After some inquiries, a Prussian was found who had been in the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> wars all his life, and was perfectly <hi rend="italics">as fait.</hi>--The model made by him will be erected on the <rs type="place">Court green</rs> to-morrow, that being <placeName reg="County Court">County Court</placeName> day, and an effort will be made to get a handsome appropriation from the <rs type="place">Court</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Citizens have already subscribed liberally.--<persName n="Phillips,,R.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Phillips,R.,H.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, is a leading man in all these matters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> It is reported that <num value="1">one</num> or more of our ministers will go as Chaplains, or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But to-day our churches were open as usual, and crowds improved the beautiful day to attend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Where I worshiped, the people seemed unusually solemn and tender in view of the state of things, and especially of the places made vacant by those off at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, or perhaps engaged in deadly conflict at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7013352" n="1.000 4" reg="baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>During the hour of service, <persName n="Points,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Points,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Points</surname></persName>, of this town, a special messenger from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, arrived in town with sealed orders, and bringing letters from our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It looked like war times indeed, to see these letters delivered during sermon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Answers had to be ready by <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time>, when the messenger would start back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He left <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> afternoon, drove all night, pressed <num value="3">three</num> horses <hi rend="italics">en route, </hi> also a buggy, his own breaking down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>By-the-way, pressing a horse has now become common in this region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He says the country between this and <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> is alive with soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> As I came from church this morning, I witnessed the arrest of a suspicious character, who had been tampering with negroes, and said he was going to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He is in jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>All such persons, their guilt being established, should be unceremoniously swung up as examples. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Notice was given in all the churches to-day, requesting each family to observe from <num value="6">6</num> to <time value="7am">7 A. M.</time>, as a season of special prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This was adopted as preferable to a daily union prayer meeting, which was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Our people at large will be ready to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>O, let them not forget to <hi rend="italics">pray.</hi> How precious and appropriate are some of the <name>Psalms</name> now! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> I met yesterday a prominent citizen of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> who had brought his family to this town as to a place of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He said many ladies were coming here soon from <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">lower</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This may be a peculiarly safe place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I believe it is as safe as any. But <persName n="Harper,General,Kenton,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Harper,Kenton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Kenton</foreName> <surname>Harper</surname></persName>, of this county, months ago expressed the opinion that from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> would be <num value="1">one</num> of the battle-grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>However this may be, when I go, I shall leave my family here. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> It has been suggested to move the works at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> and the <rs>Virginia</rs> workmen there, to some safe place beyond this &mdash; say <placeName reg="Clifton Forge, Clifton Forge, Virginia" key="tgn,2111224">Clifton Forge</placeName> &mdash; and go right on manufacturing arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I commend this to his <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, who knows all about it. Arms will now be a great want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>By-the-way, we are all proud of our Governor now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> P. S.--Since the above was written, another messenger has arrived from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The troops are expecting an attack from <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> men. These men tried to take the cars at <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>, but were not allowed to do so. They then went to <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburgh</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Such manifestations cannot fail to buoy the hearts and nerve the arms of these gallant patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>After remaining at the depot for a few moments, exchanging mutual congratulations of the crowd, the whistle announced the hour of parting, and as the train moved off <num value="3">three</num> cheers were again given with a hearty good will. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The world are at a loss to know what ideas of statesmanship or what principles of policy govern the powers at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>From the hour they assumed the direction of affairs, there is not <num value="1">one</num> single act of wisdom, of statesmanship, or of patriotism, that can be found in their whole conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>They are strangers to all patriotic emotions; for there has not <num value="1">one</num> single word escaped them which has touched the patriotic heart, or has excited a patriotic impulse in a single <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>They seem incapable of any act of genuine nobleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Their action falls as coldly upon the country as the snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Their words are as unfeeling as their policy is vengeful and cunning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> The demonstration upon <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> disclosed the selfish and calculating counsels that actuate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The manly course would have been the withdrawal of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName></hi> and the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>They had not the generosity or the courage to do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>They feared the clamor of the <rs>North</rs>, and they preferred to risk a <num value="100">hundred</num> lives rather than risk the frowns of a ruthless faction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>They sent around their fleet to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> merely as a feint, merely to make a demonstration of energy; when they knew that the certain consequence of their conduct would be to put every man's life in <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> at hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>That was the cold and cruel beginning of their Campaign against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It was enough to disgust every Union man in its whole borders with a cause which was so butchered and disgraced by its official managers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> Their concentrating, or attempting to concentrate, immense numbers of troops at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, is another act of cowardly selfishness which must greatly disgust even their own adherents and apologists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>No <num value="1">one</num> thought of molesting them in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> until they invited molestation by their wicked and foolish call for <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> troops to assemble there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The plainest considerations must have taught them that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would not brook a formidable menace of that sort from an unscrupulous foe upon her very borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>If they had paid less attention to the flattering assurances of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hooks,</hi> and more to the real oracles of popular sentiment in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, they might have anticipated the resistance that has risen up so suddenly and unexpectedly in that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The consequence of this needless call for a vast army of men has been to make their dispersion and the taking of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> a military and political necessity to both <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.--The demonstration upon <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> forced <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The call for <num value="75">seventy-five</num> regiments has converted <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> from a Union to a secession State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The occupation and fortification of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> by so numerous an army, though in tended for their security, really places them in most imminent peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It is said that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> starts at the mention of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jeff,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Jeff,nomatch:0"><surname>Jeff</surname></persName>.Davis or <persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName>, or <persName n="McCullogh,,Ben,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="default:McCullogh,Ben,,,"><foreName>Ben</foreName> <surname>McCullogh</surname></persName>,</hi> and that a body-guard of <placeName reg="Kansas cut">Kansas cut</placeName>-throats' under the lead of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lamb,,Jim,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="default:Lamb,Jim,,,"><foreName>Jim</foreName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>,</hi> the murderer, sleep every night in the <name>East Room</name>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> The marauding expedition which the <rs>Washington Administration</rs> sent to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> was dictated by a spirit as cowardly as it was impotent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Why was <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Wright,nomatch:0"><surname>Wright</surname></persName>,</hi> an Army officer, sent upon an excursion of a naval vessel, under naval command, unless it was because of his officious suggestions of this reckless policy, early made and long persisted in, and his malignant zeal for burnings and destruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>What principles of elevated statesmanship could have dictated the burning of the best <placeName reg="Navy-Yard">Navy-Yard</placeName> belonging to the <rs>Government</rs>, and some of the finest vessels in the service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The Navy-Yard was unoccupied and undefended; and upon <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> own theory, that there can be no secession, and that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and every part of her, is still under the <rs>Federal</rs> jurisdiction, this act was a plain levying of war upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Thus the <rs>President</rs> himself is guilty of high treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>What can be said of the policy of an Administration which, under the pretext of suppressing insurrection, deliberately puts itself into the position of levying war upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>This proceeding at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> is of valuable significance in <num value="1">one</num> particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It clearly reveals the animus of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It shows that they have no hope of further deceiving <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> into the occupation of a neutral attitude; and that they intend war to the knife against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The only powers in the country which hold the issues of war and peace absolutely in their hands, are the powers at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>They can never restore the <rs>Union</rs>; but they can restore peace without the further effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It is plain, however, that they intend to eschew such a policy, for their proceeding at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> utterly negatives every idea of peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> There is but <num value="1">one</num> possible chance for the early cessation of hostilities; and that chance lies in the blunders of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.</hi> It is impossible but that his incompetency and folly will bring him to a speedy downfall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It is not an unfrequent circumstance that wickedness and sin thus produce their own cure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It is an old adage, that if persons of a certain class are given rope enough they speedily hang themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The Administration at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> have already done much in this direction.--They have produced secession where secession never could have been effected but for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They have raised up enemies in their path by every measure they have taken to put down enemies already in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>They are beautifully illustrating the art of sinking the ship of State in attempting to navigate her. Their follies and blunders seem to point to the only exit for the country from the evils which those very follies produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>In <num value="2">two</num> more months the <rs>North</rs> itself will pray for the downfall of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.</hi> They can afford to tolerate his Administration much less than the <rs>South</rs>.
