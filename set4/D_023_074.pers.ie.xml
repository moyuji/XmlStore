<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Just in sight of <placeName reg="Boonsboro, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2046303">Boonesboro</placeName>', the whole army stopped to camp and cook rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>As usual, several soldiers made their way on to town in search of something good to eat. No danger was apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and staff rode on in front, not dreaming of danger; but just as they had reached the centre of the town <orgName n="company"><persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s company</orgName> made a dash upon them and the straggling soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I saw the cloud of dust, but could not for a moment divine its meaning, until I saw the horsemen come dashing back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Fortunately, no injury was done, though a ball pierced the hat of <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s aids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I heard in <placeName reg="Williamsport, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7016329">Williamsport</placeName> &mdash; his residence &mdash; that <persName n="Russell,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> was wounded in the mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They were taking dinner at a hotel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The enemy fled before us from <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>; we pursued; a part of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s forces captured the <rs type="place">Maryland Heights</rs>; others got possession of the <rs type="place">Loudoun Heights</rs>, and we surrender them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Thus the words of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Andrew,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> were literally verified, that <persName n="Harper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><surname>Harper</surname></persName>'s Ferry would prove a <hi rend="italics">man-trap</hi> to any party who might attempt to hold it. Their troops were living on half rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A large number of stolen negroes were also captured, estimated at from <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="800">eight hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Having filled our haversacks with <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations of crackers, <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s corps started, a little after <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> on the night of the surrender, directly for <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName>, waded the river, and proceeded at once into the heaviest of the fight on the extreme left of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">second brigade</orgName> was that evening exposed to a severe cannonade from the enemy for an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName n="Kelly,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Kelly,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Kelly</surname></persName>, who at that time commanded the brigade, was slightly wounded and retired from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The command of the brigade then devolved upon <persName n="Penn,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Penn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Penn</surname></persName>, of the <num value="42" type="ordinal">42d</num> We lay all night on the field, and the morning of the bloodiest day of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> history still found us in the same position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We were in an uncommonly exposed position, on a ridge just between <num value="2">two</num> depressions, <num value="1">one</num> about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">100 yards</measure> in front, and the other about the same distance in rear of our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The firing commenced early in the morning, even before light.--About sunrise it commenced along our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> our men began to fall from their long- range guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The enemy were about <measure n="400yards" type="distance">400 yards distant</measure>, behind a fence, and were so covered by the position that we could see them only when they rose to shoot.--Many of our men thus fell from their long-range guns--<num value="6">six</num> around me whom I could have touched without rising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Up to this time the cannon had been doing but little execution, nearly every charge passing entirely above us. About <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> we were ordered to fall back to the woods, where we were well protected by the nature of the ground &mdash; In this movement I was wounded, and left the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The firing continued incessantly during the day and till <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The right of the enemy's line was turned, and we drove them back to the <rs type="place">Boonesboro' mountains</rs> &mdash; to the position they held in the <rs>Sunday</rs>'s fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It was horrible in the extreme to witness the men with mangled limbs and bodies making their way to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>As early as <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> the whole face of the country seemed covered with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Our loss must have been much heavier than in any previous battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>though much less than that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The number wounded was extremely large compared with those killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The Confederates held the field for more than a day to bury their dead, and they fell back this side of the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> the enemy attempted to cross, but <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Gen,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> <sic>mowed</sic> down whole columns of them in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><num value="2">Two</num> brigades, I understand, had crossed before he attacked them, but were soon driven back, many of them finding a watery grave before reaching the opposite shore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Our army is increasing every day, and not withstanding the numbers lost in the late battles, now numbers more than it has for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> who were broken down and left sick on the road during the late marches, are once more making their way to their companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Hundreds, too, of convalescents from hospitals who were stopped at <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> and sent on to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, are rejoining their commands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Speculators constantly follow in the wake of an army; scarcely had our army passed before the country was swarming with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Nearly all goods for sale in the country was immediately bought it up and sent to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> for speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The merchants here, not thinking of such exorbitant prices, sold at reasonable rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This is a subject to which the attention of the authorities should be called, for now those very articles which have been carried off are much needed by our toll-worn soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The country from <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName> to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> is thickly dotted with the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/><placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and the several towns on the road, have a large number of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The citizens along the route are sorely tried, and it astonishes me to see with how much fortitude they bear up under the many calls made upon their hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I have now a family before my mind who, since the fight, have never turned away the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> from their door unfed, often having <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> at a meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The <rs>Lord</rs> who permitted not the widow's cruise of oil to fail, will surely bless them in the end. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>A decarbonized steel cylinder (that is, a steel cylinder returned to its original state of soft iron,) is next rolled over the hardened plate by powerful machinery, until the engraved impression appears in relief, the hollow lines of the original becoming ridges upon the cylinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> In the above quotation, the phrase <q>&#x0022;either by hand or mechanically,&#x0022;</q> may need explanation.-- Some of the engraving on bank notes, strange as it may seem, is actually done by a machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> Lithographic engraving as applied to the fine arts is a misnomer; there is no engraving about it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> The word lithography means the art of drawing on stone; hence a picture printed from <q> &#x0022;a drawing on stone&#x0022;</q> is called a lithograph, and such are our Confederate notes, engraved by Hoyer &#x0026; <persName n="Ludwig,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Ludwig,nomatch:0"><surname>Ludwig</surname></persName>, which are so extensively counterfeited.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> These are colored with an abundance of <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">blue</rs>, and yellow, after they are printed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The stones from which lithographic pictures are taken cannot be duplicated perfectly, although I have seen a statement in the newspapers, within a few months, that <persName n="Hoyer,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Hoyer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Hoyer</surname></persName> &#x0026; <persName n="Ludwig,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Ludwig,nomatch:0"><surname>Ludwig</surname></persName> made use of a process by which they could do it. That they may have a process of transferring an impression already taken to a fresh stone, so as to assist the artist materially in copying with <hi rend="italics">tolerable</hi> accuracy and uniformity, is very probable; but that they cannot make perfect copies, their works show for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>In comparing <num value="6">a half dozen</num> genuine <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> bills of their engraving, a marked difference may be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>I have not examined the smaller denominations with the view of detecting variations, but presume similar variations may be found in them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Now, the question naturally arises, why did the <rs>Government</rs> resort to such uncertain and dangerous means of supplying the wants of a circulating medium?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>I answer, probably it was the best they could do at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Formerly, nearly all bank note engraving, and, in fact, engravings of every kind, was mostly done at the <rs>North</rs>, and if there were any good engravers in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at all, there were probably not enough to supply the wants of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, in his recent report, states that the services of over <num value="70">seventy</num> clerks are required in <hi rend="italics">signing</hi> the bills. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> Now, any <num value="1">one</num> can see at once that an impression from a lithographic or steel plate cannot be taken as quick as a clerk can sign <num value="1">one</num>, consequently, numerous plates must be had, requiring, of course, numerous engravers &mdash; more probably, than could be obtained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> It is not probable that there was a person in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who had a practical knowledge of the method of reproducing steel plates as before described; consequently, they had to resort to the uncertain process of lithography.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>I remarked before that a lithographic plate only admitted of about <num value="1600">1,600</num> impressions being taken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> Now, when we consider that <num value="1500">1,500</num> <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollar</measure> bills only amounts to <measure n="150000dollars" type="currency">$150,000</measure>, and that <num value="1000000">millions</num> are required instead of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, it will be very readily seen that new plates must constantly be made, and as they cannot be made <hi rend="italics">erectly</hi> like those used before, this will explain why genuine bills of the same denomination differ from each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> I would here caution persons who happen to have <num value="2">two</num> or more bills of the same denomination differing from each other not to get alarmed, as that of itself is no evidence of any of them being spurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>I have myself, within a day or <num value="2">two</num>, seen in the possession of <num value="1">one</num> person <num value="5">five</num> <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollar</measure> Confederate notes, having all the marks of the genuine, yet but <num value="2">two</num> out of the <num value="5">five</num> were alike, and the difference was in the engraving. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> I very much question whether any person, however good a judge of bank notes generally he may be, can pronounce with certainty upon the genuineness of the <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> Confederate notes unless he is furnished with genuine notes of all the different issues; of course I except those that are known to be counterfeit; a person with half an eye can detect them at once, after being made acquainted with their peculiarities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> It is comparatively an easy matter for bank officers to detect counterfeits on their own banks or those of the same town or city, or those of the neighboring cities, because they have but <num value="1">one</num> plate for each denomination, and any variation from these is easily detected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> The old issues of some of the <rs>Charleston</rs> and <rs>Savannah</rs> banks were quite coarsely engraved, much of the wood engraving of the present day being vastly superior to it. I have known frequent instances in which these were pronounced counterfeit by those that were considered good judges of money, but when they were presented at the bank were declared genuine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> It is an old adage that the cheapest things are the dearest in the long run, and I think the people at large will find it so in this instance, if the <rs>Government</rs> does not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> It is to be regretted that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, or whoever had the matter in charge, did not in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance procure from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> good engravers, if we did not have a sufficiency at home, and more especially a person who understood the art of reproducing engraved steel plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>We would then have had uniformity at least in our currency, which is a great desideratum, as it would tend greatly to prevent counterfeiting and make detection much more easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> The Federal invasion, especially in its relations to negroes, has thus far been a <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> raid on a grand scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Wherever the <rs>Federal</rs> armies have advanced the negroes have been swept off as clean as the <rs>Eastern</rs> locusts sweep a field of grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="color">green</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs> thing is left in the line of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> march, nor in the whole country for many miles around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The <rs>Piedmont</rs>, the <rs type="place">Upper Valley</rs>, the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, the country watered by the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> and the <rs>Potomac</rs>, have been stripped of their negro population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>This war has assumed the character of a grand Negro Hunting Expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Of victories the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have gained few; negroes many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>What becomes of the game, it is impossible to say, nor is that a matter of much consequence. --The loss, however, of so valuable an element of strength and prosperity is a matter of such moment that the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State</orgName> ought at once to take measures for the prevention of similar calamities in the future.--This can only be done by a law providing for the removal of negroes from all threatened districts to the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>It will not do to leave this to the discretion or judgment of the masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>In some cases, they are too indolent to take the proper precautions for the security of their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>In others, they are deluded by implicit confidence in the fidelity of their servants, and, notwithstanding the experience which the war has furnished that the neighborhood of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army creates as complete a <hi rend="italics">stampede</hi> among negroes as the approach of a locomotive among cattle, there are <num value="1000">thousands</num> of masters who continue to believe that <hi rend="italics">their</hi> servants will not run under similar temptations, and foolishly to expose them to temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It is clear, therefore, that there is no security for the negro property of the <rs>State</rs>, unless the <name>Legislature</name> makes the removal of the negroes from districts exposed to invasion compulsory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>We trust the necessary action will be taken promptly, for the <rs>State</rs> has already suffered enormous losses from this cause, which, by precautionary legislation, might all have been prevented. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Unprovoked! why the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform embraced this doctrine, and avowed the determination to make war upon the institutions of the <rs>South</rs> through the instrumentality of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Unprovoked! Why Congress had been converted into an abolition debating society, and nothing had been spoken there that had not some reference to the negro, for <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure>. The Government had no foreign policy whatever, because Congress could not spare time from its abolition occupations to attend to so small a matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It was impossible to introduce any bill that did not give rise to an angry debate upon the everlasting negro.
