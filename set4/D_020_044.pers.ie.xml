<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>This ought to be enough to prove that it is utterly inefficient, and ought, according to the understanding of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, to be declared <unclear>gatory,</unclear> and not to be respected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> Pertinent to this subject, there has been within a day or <num value="2">two</num> some little excitement to the commercial community of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It is known that <num value="1">one</num> or more vessels, laden with tobacco, have sailed from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> harbors to foreign ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Those vessels either ran the blockade or were allowed to pass border of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.</hi> In either case, they are proof agains, the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>This being <unclear></unclear> to the regular trade of tobacco, buying and selling, it was deemed a fit subject for investigation, and, we learn, the <orgName n="Trade Board" type="board">Board of Trade</orgName> took the matter under consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The <orgName n="Foreign Affairs Committee" type="committee">Committee of Foreign Affairs</orgName> of Congresses and then attention called to the subject and had members of the community of tobacco dealers before them to ascertain all the fact that were attainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>What there were, a course we are not at liberty to state; but it is rumored that a bill will probably pass Congress to prohibit shipments of produce abroad in this manner, and, indeed, to place an embargo on such shipments until the blockade is fully removed or peace restored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> We see also, that several cargoes of turpentine have gone from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> to <orgName n="British Canadian" type="newspaper">British Canadian</orgName> ports, and possibly some to the <rs>Federal</rs> ports, as the article is wanted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Congress will no doubt look into the whole matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>These men, under every inconvenience and hardship, murmur not. There is the greater propriety in anticipating their wants and in ministering to their necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>When such provision is not made at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session of the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> after this notice, I call upon the patriotic citizens of the counties or corporations so failing, to hold public meetings, and appoint committees, whose duty it shall be to make provision for clothing such companies as it may be in their power to provide for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/> I sit down to give an account &mdash; not of the action yesterday, but of what I saw with my own eyes, hitherto not often deceived, and of what I heard with mine own ears, which in the country are not so much to be trusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Let me, however, express an opinion as to the affair of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>In the first place, the repulse of the <name>Federalists</name>, decided as it was, might have had no serious effects whatever beyond the mere failure &mdash; which politically was of greater consequence than it was in a military sense &mdash; but for the disgraceful conduct of the troops. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/> The retreat on their lines at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> seems to have ended in a cowardly route &mdash; a miserable, causeless panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Such scandalous behavior on the part of soldiers I should have considered impossible, as with some experience of camps and armies I have never ever in alarms among camp followers seen the like of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The streets, in spite of the rain, are crowded by people with anxious faces, and groups of wavering politicians are assembled at the corners, in the hotel passages, and the bars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/> How to get out was the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>The rumors of great disaster and repulse had spread through the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The livery stable keepers, with <num value="1">one</num> exception, refused to send out horses to the scene of station &mdash; at least, the exception told me so. <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Congressmen were going to make a day of it, and all the vehicles and horses that could be procured were in requirement for the scene of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>This curiosity was aroused by the story that <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00270" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> had actually been ordered to make an attack on <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and that <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> had given him till <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> to be master of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s lines.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/> An <name>English</name> gentleman who accompanied me was strongly dissuaded from going by a Colonel of Cavalry on the staff, because, he said, <q>&#x0022;the troops are green, and no <num value="1">one</num> can tell what may happen.&#x0022;</q> But my friend got his pass from <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who was taking the whole affair of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and the pressure of the morrows' work with perfect calm, and we started on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>--not so early is we ought perhaps, which was none of my hair &mdash; for <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, distant about <placeName><distance reg="25miles">twenty-five miles</distance> <offset>Southwest</offset> of  <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></placeName>. </p>

I do not give, as may be observed, the names of regiments, unless in special cases--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because they posses little interest, I conceive, for those in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> who may read these letters, and secondly, because there is an exceedingly complex system &mdash; at least to a foreigner &mdash; of nomenclature in the forces, and <num value="1">one</num> may make a mistake between a regiment of volunteers and a regiment of State militia of the same number, or even of regulars in the lower figures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>The soldiers lounging about the forts and over the <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs> across the <rs>Potomac</rs> were an exceedingly unkempt <q>&#x0022;loafing&#x0022;</q> set of fellows, who handled their firelock, like pitchforks and spades, and I doubt if some of those who read or tried to read our papers could understand them, as they certainly did not speak <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00280" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> possess excellent working materials, however, and I have had occasion repeatedly to remark the rapidity and still with which they construct earth works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>These works did not appear to be strongly held, but it is possible men were in the tents near at hand, deserted though they seemed, and at all events reinforcements could be speedily poured in if necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/> The long and weary way was varied by different pickets along the road, and by examination of our papers and passes at different points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>But the country looked vacant in spite of crops of <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> corn, for the houses were shut up, and the few indigenous people whom we met looked most blackly under their brows at the supposed abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>This portion of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is well wooded, and undulating in heavy regular waves of field and forest; but the roads are deeply cut and filled with those stones, very disagreeable to ride or drive over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>The houses are of wood, with the usual negro hats adjoining them, and the specimens of the race which I saw were well dressed and not ill looking. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/> <num value="1">One</num> man said it began at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, but the pickets told us it had really become continuous about <time value="7:30">half-past 7</time> or <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>I was just about to ask <num value="1">one</num> of the men for a light, when a sputtering fire on my right attracted my attention, and out of the forest or along the road rushed a number of men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>I rode across <num value="1">one</num> and stopped him. <q>&#x0022;We're pursued by cavalry,&#x0022;</q> he gasped; <q>&#x0022;They've cut us all to pieces.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The clouds of dust were denser and nearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>That was all. There was no firing &mdash; no musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>I turned my horse's head, and rode away through the village, and after I got out upon the road the same confusion seemed to prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Drivers flogged, lashed, spurred and beat their horses, or leaped down and abandoned their teams and ran by the side of the road; mounted men, servants and men in uniform, vehicles of all sorts, commissariat wagons thronged the narrow ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>At every shot, a convulsion, as it were, seized upon the morbid mass of bones, sinew, wood and iron, and thrilled through it, giving new energy and action to its desperate efforts to get free from itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Again the cry of <q>&#x0022;Cavalry&#x0022;</q> arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> And so the fight went on. At <num value="1">one</num> time a whole mass of infantry, with fixed bayonets, ran down the bank of the road, and some falling as they ran must have killed and wounded those among whom they fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>But mounted men still rode faster, shouting out, <q>&#x0022;Cavalry are coming.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>Of Course, we must expect them to meet these hard facts by a certain quantity of muster &mdash; They must call out a few more <num value="1000000">millions</num> of volunteers, and they must make a confident demand upon an incredulous world for a few more <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> sterling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>But behind all this there must rise a gathering doubt that this Southern not is too hard to crack, and that the military line, as a matter of business, does not answer.
