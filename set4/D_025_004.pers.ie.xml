<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> This is the <date value="07-04">Fourth of July</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In former days it was saluted with the firing of guns, and was honored by grand parades, orations, dinners, and toasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> was generally read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The exertions oratorical were considered too great for <num value="1">one</num> man &mdash; so there was a reader and an orator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The reader recited on solemn and emphatic tones the <name>Declaration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He began with energy, and rose as he continued, until he thundered in the conclusion wherein our forefathers declared that <unclear></unclear> held the <rs>British</rs> as they held &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">the rest of <unclear>nkind</unclear></hi> --Enemies in War, in peace, friends.&#x0022; Here the roof was perceptibly stated by the powerful and indignant tones the youthful patriot just from college, to <unclear></unclear> the task was usually assigned, and who, <unclear></unclear> again the part of the signers, boldly <unclear></unclear> defiantly flag down the gauntlet to the <unclear>annous</unclear> <rs type="role" reg="King">King</rs> of Britain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> &#x0022;Enemies in war, in peace, friends!&#x0022;--<unclear></unclear> let us just remark upon this magnanimous pronunciamento of our Revolutionary <unclear>thers</unclear> that while it was rather dramatic <unclear></unclear> they were assuming new relations towards a really great people, a people who, <unclear></unclear> all their arrogance and overbearing <unclear>dis</unclear>, they could still have some respect for that a contract, say the worst we can of <unclear></unclear> do they present to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Could <unclear></unclear> Confederacy &mdash; could a State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>--<unclear></unclear> to-day towards the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, <unclear></unclear> did our ancestors towards the <rs>British</rs>, that we hold them as we hold the rest of <unclear>man</unclear>--enemies in war, in peace, friends?&#x0022; <unclear>ave</unclear> not their brutalities &mdash; their war of <unclear>ra</unclear> --their burning of towns and churches--<unclear></unclear> burning of <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs>--their <unclear>ming</unclear> the servile population against our people &mdash; their efforts, in every conceivable form <unclear></unclear> robbery, destruction, and by all kinds of <unclear>inbolical</unclear> agencies, to break the spirit of our <unclear></unclear> and starve them into subjection &mdash; formed <unclear></unclear> so impassable between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> that the sentiment of friendship is <unclear> </unclear> that can never exist between them as <unclear>nalous?</unclear> Hatred of the <rs>North</rs> will be a legacy <unclear></unclear> future generations of the <rs>South</rs> that will <unclear> </unclear> as long as the <name>Governments</name> themselves, and probably survive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We can never told the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> &#x0022;as we hold the rest of mankind!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> But to return to the subject of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> the oration was generally allotted to promising young men of the localities as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effort, and was therefore as studied and ornate is possible for a youthful and ambitious mind all of expectation and hope to make it. It was always an animated paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>If it did not <unclear>here</unclear> to the rules applicable to such efforts <unclear></unclear> mattered it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The day was <num value="1">one</num> of enthusiasm, bursting patriotism, and jollification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The eagle was in the ascendant, and that bird <unclear>ing</unclear> the presiding genius of the day, even <unclear>thos</unclear> itself was, for the time, consecrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>After the oration the parades, the dinners, the <unclear>asts,</unclear> and the parting salutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Everybody was gay &mdash; everybody was fired with patriotism, and many with wine or whiskey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The South was therefore a jolly day &mdash; it was a day the like of which is necessary for every nation; for no nation that is civilized and humanized can got along without its holidays--<unclear></unclear> days of festivity and general joy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Thus we had our <date value="07-04">Fourth of July</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The day is now changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We have no holiday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The ruthless enemy who has trampled upon every principle and right commemorated by the day itself, gives no intermission for festive enjoyments, were we so inclined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is, however, still dear to Southern people; and they prove their devotion to it by maintaining with their blood and their lives the rights and principles asserted by our fathers in <num value="76">76</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will probably to-day renew their professions of respect and devotion for them, notwithstanding that they have crushed them into the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They are hypocrites and Pharisees enough for that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, fringed and gilt with certain transcendentalisms, imbibed from the <rs>French</rs> philosophy of the day, with which <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> and his contemporaries had become somewhat inoculated, set forth the popular rights for which we are this day battling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The main principles it asserted the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> never could approve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is that Governments, &#x0022;derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> think they have a right to govern the <rs>Southern</rs> people against their consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They have desecrated both the day and the principles which it commemorates, and the very best way in which we can celebrate it is by whipping them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>A good victory over them would be the best tribute we could offer to the memory of the signers of the <name>Declaration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Let us pray for <num value="1">one</num>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We do not know whether or no our leaders foresaw it; but unlearned men predicted it. We shall soon know, however, whether the movement was anticipated and provided for. That we have the troops near this city to defeat the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> whenever they meet them we have no manner of doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It they are but brought front to front with them that is all they want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is true that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> never show an over-eagerness to meet our men, but we trust that they may be brought up to the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It would be a matter of deep regret if they are allowed to linger about this city destroying property and interrupting communication. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Unlike the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, the war of Southern Independence has never been paralyzed for an hour by the treason of Toryism, or by internal jealousies and dissensions among the champions of liberty.

In this great straggle, no State can claim the pre-eminence in valor, virtue, and disinterested devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The swords of <num value="1">one</num> and all have struck fire together in the front of the battle, and the laurels which <unclear></unclear> thickly upon our victorious banners <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> have been fertilized by kindred drops of blood and tears. </p>
