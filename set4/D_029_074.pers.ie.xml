<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> It must be acknowledged that a territory like the <rs>South</rs> is worth fighting for. <num value="850000">Eight hundred and fifty thousand</num> square miles, as large as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, with a most productive soil and a most genial climate, whose staple productions none of those great countries can grow; with <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure> of coast line, indented with bays and crowded with islands, and its vast centre watered by the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, into whose bosom are poured <measure n="36000miles" type="distance">thirty-six thousand miles</measure> of tributary streams. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Let us see what the &#x0022;goose that laid the golden egg&#x0022; was doing before the experiment of &#x0022;cutting it open&#x0022; was undertaken by the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The Census of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> and the <name>Report</name> of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> for <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> show that each inhabitant of the <rs>South</rs>, of all classes, produced <measure n="13.30dollars" type="currency">$13.30</measure> more than each individual at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The average agricultural production at the <rs>South</rs> was <measure n="58dollars" type="currency">$58</measure> to each person, when, at the <rs>North</rs>, it was only <measure n="44.70dollars" type="currency">$44.70</measure>. The total agricultural productions for <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> amounted to <num value="1000">one thousand</num>, <num value="164000000">one hundred and sixty four millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Of this sum, the <rs>North</rs> produced, in round numbers, <num value="604000000">six hundred and four millions</num>, and the <rs>South</rs> <num value="560000000">five hundred and sixty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, <num value="23191876">23,191,876</num>; gives for average production by each person, <measure n="50.20dollars" type="currency">$50.20</measure>.

If deduct from agricultural products amount exported (<measure n="118750118dollars" type="currency">$118,750,118</measure>), there is left for home consumption <measure n="1045707665dollars" type="currency">$1,045,707,665</measure>.--Each person, therefore, consumed <measure n="45.08dollars" type="currency">$45.08</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> What country on the face of the earth, cultivated by free labor, can produce such a record?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But the <rs>North</rs> was, after all, the chief gainer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The immense surplus of the <rs>South</rs> went into her hands, in exchange for Northern notions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The South paid the great bulk of the revenue, and, by her agricultural industry, built up the commerce and manufactures of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It remains to be seen whether the cultivation of the <rs>Southern</rs> soil by the sword instead of the plough share will improve Northern prosperity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> On the fine territory of the <rs>South</rs> we had at the beginning of the war a population more than <num value="4">four</num> times as large as that with which the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies separated from the mother country, and quite as large as the whole population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> after the conclusion of that war. Our exports were <num value="3">three</num> times as great as those of the whole <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Our muster rolls exhibited a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men &mdash; of men accustomed to the use of the rifle, and as brave as any race of men on the face of the earth.--The character of the population in general showed a higher tone of morality than could be found in any other country of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In respect for female virtue, in integrity in business transactions, in truth, frankness, simplicity, generosity, and hospitality, no community that ever lived surpassed the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These are strange results, if slavery be the mother of poverty and crime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Several interesting points are suggested <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> by the facts above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Such an extent of territory--<num value="850000">eight hundred and fifty thousand</num> square miles &mdash; a vast land of mountain and forest as well as fertile plain, and defended by a <num value="1000000">million</num> of brave men, can never be subjugated except by the consent of its own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Its huge dimensions may render it impossible to defend every point, but they render it equally impossible for an enemy to occupy every point with a force sufficient to keep the country in subjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If we fall, it must be by our own mismanagement, discord and imbecility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Such a land is worth many battles and many sacrifices; not alone for its material wealth, not for the system of slave labor which has produced that wealth, but for the people &mdash; the generous, noble people &mdash; by whom it is inhabited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is our land, the land where we were born, the land of our father's graves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We do not believe, if it is determined to be free, that it can ever be enslaved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But if the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> be otherwise, we shall have the grim consolation of seeing our oppressors overwhelmed in the common ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>With the downfall of slave labor, comes the downfall of their own commerce and manufactures as surely as darkness follows the setting of the sun. If it be not our land, it will be a howling wilderness. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> We cannot but admire the inextinguishable hopefulness and intrepidity of the <rs>Confederates</rs> abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We have often paid an humble tribute to their fervid and disinterested love of country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But the subject grows upon us as we consider it. We feel it impossible to repress our enthusiasm, to keep the tears of admiration from our eyes, and the shouts of &#x0022;<persName n="Bravo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Bravo,nomatch:0"><surname>Bravo</surname></persName>&#x0022; and &#x0022;Encore&#x0022; from our lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We have never seen, never heard, never dreamed, of such devotion to country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The fall of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Wilmington River, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2775185">Wilmington</placeName>, only refreshes their indomitable pluck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The sky itself might fall; and if it caught those hopeful larks, it would be more than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s blockaders were able to do when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> flew from their beloved parent nest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is delightful to hear the carols of these songsters, perched upon pleasant twigs in <name>English</name> flower-gardens, bidding the <rs>Confederate</rs> eagle, as he soars and screams in the thunder cloud, be of &#x0022;good cheer.&#x0022; The closing of our ports may keep muskets, and cannon, and powder, from reaching us, but it cannot exclude the inspiring voices of our countrymen abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The sternest warrior feels fresh strength and determination when every gale from the <rs>East</rs> bears to his ears the irrepressible, magnificent strains of the <rs>Confederates</rs> abroad, and even the weak-kneed and faint-hearted feel inclined to imitate their heroic example, and wish that they, too, could join the <rs>Confederate</rs> orchestra in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and swell their sublime chorus. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> They assure us now &mdash; those considerate, cheerful, disinterested songsters &mdash; that, if we will only hold on a little longer, something is going to happen in a few months greatly to our advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They cannot, at present, inform us exactly what it is. The thing, you perceive, is confidential, and they would as soon forsake their country as betray confidence; but we may rely upon it that the world is going to be astonished in a few weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Well, we can tell them another secret; we are going to &#x0022;hold on&#x0022; to our country a good deal longer than they did; we have faith in our cause and in ourselves, and more faith in Heaven than in princes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It may be that, contrary to their own inclinations, the <name>Powers</name> and potentates abroad may be ultimately involved in this quarrel &mdash; we think it likely they will be; but whether they are or not, our intentions are the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The Confederates abroad shall never have reason to blush for their countrymen at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We will make them even prouder of us than of themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> Not that we would institute invidious comparisons between different classes of Confederate citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Each has faculties adapted to its peculiar sphere of exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Some are born for battle and for privation; others, for refreshing and encouraging those who must fight and endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We do not expect our women or our confederates abroad to shoulder a musket; but they can still help the cause by stimulating those who do. The Confederates abroad are our orchestra, our bands of music, who keep up the <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> spirits of our soldiers, and, by occasional comic melodies, prevent them from becoming melancholy, and, even amid the sulphurous stench and glare of battle, make them laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The exiles of no other nation have ever been able to keep up their own courage, much less that of their countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> recollects the stern, sad faces of the <name>Poles</name>, who used to take refuge in this country, and how, whenever <persName n="Poland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Poland,nomatch:0"><surname>Poland</surname></persName> made another attempt to break her chains, they rushed back to their native land like men possessed of evil spirits.
