<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> of this month, our regiment was ordered to leave its encampment near <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>, and go up towards <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> on picket duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The day upon which we set out was pleasant, and although the roads were quite muddy from the recent rains, we had a much more agreeable march than we anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Our officers were kind in permitting us to avail ourselves of the side walks upon the turnpike, some of them walking for the weary to ride, and others administering to our comfort by passing up and down the line and treating us to peaches, pears and melons they had bought upon the way. Our captain is peculiarly good at this, and I think he has found out the true secret of governing his men. We passed <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName> with our spirits much more elated than when we retreated from that place at the approach of the <q>&#x0022;Grand Army&#x0022;</q> on <date value="07-17">Wednesday, the 17th of July.</date> With <q>&#x0022;arms at will&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;route step,&#x0022;</q> and many a joke and heartylaugh, we wended our way towards the <q>&#x0022;city of the <name>Great King</name>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The country in front rises in beautiful undulations until the hill region of the <rs>Potomac</rs> forms a vast amphitheatre, in which are to be seen clusters of chestnut, skirts of cedar, dispersed in various profusion, cultivated fields of corn and buckwheat in full bloom, stately mansions, and orchards laden with delicious fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Near the road, we observed some few abandoned houses of noble souls who had left all for the sake of the <rs>Union</rs>, and are ready not only to sacrifice their property but their lives and sacred honor in defence of a political and military despotism, for which their fathers did not fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>After stopping to rest several times and filling up our canteens with good cool water, we came in sight of <placeName reg="Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia" key="tgn,2111722">Falls Church</placeName>, distant about <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> from our encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This is a neat village, containing about <num value="12">twelve</num> families and <num value="4">four</num> churches, at <num value="1">one</num> of which it is said that <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> often attended service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The boundary line of the original <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> runs just beyond <placeName reg="Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia" key="tgn,2111722">Falls Church</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>After passing the line stones of this District, now called the <rs type="place"><placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">County of Alexandria</placeName></rs>, we marched about <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile and stretched our arms upon <placeName reg="Minor Hill, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2517466">Brandymore Castle</placeName>, near the <rs>Alexandria</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7015770" n="1.000 22" reg="loudoun, virginia, united states">Loudoun</placeName> and <placeName reg="Hampshire" key="tgn,7008139">Hampshire</placeName> railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The eagerness and anxiety of our soldiers here to see the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Capital surpassed all bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was almost impossible for the military authorities to keep their men in camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The nearest point from which a view of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> could be had was from <placeName reg="Uptons Hill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2741436">Upton's Hill</placeName>, a place of much interest, as it is owned by the present <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black-Republican</rs> Congressman from the disloyal portion of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.--<persName n="Upton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Upton,nomatch:0"><surname>Upton</surname></persName>'s residence is pierced by <num value="2">two</num> cannon balls, fired into it by the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, when they drove the enemy off the hill some <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago. The writer of this article, as he now stands upon this lofty eminence and facing the <rs>Potomac</rs>, can see the stupendous dome of the <rs>Federal Capitol</rs> far beyond and overlooking <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah" key="tgn,2137140">Arlington Heights</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The colors of the stars and stripes floating droopingly over the doomed city, contrasts finely with the deep blueish green of the forests of the <rs type="place">Maryland Heights</rs> that lie far beyond, looming up with magnificent grandeur above all surrounding objects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> On the <rs>Maryland</rs> side, below the <rs>Capitol</rs>, appears the <rs>Lunatic Insane Asylum</rs>, a large, red, brick building, said to have been built by charitable contributions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Further back upon the heights is the residence of <persName n="Seaton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Seaton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seaton</surname></persName>, the well known editor of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName>.</hi> It is a magnificent palace, and in some respects resembles the <rs>Capitol</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The breastworks of the enemy can be distinctly seen about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> off, and sentinels standing upon post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>With the aid of the telescope, an officer upon horseback appears far in the distance under the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag, brandishing his sword and giving orders to his men. Away he dashes off at full speed, swearing, no doubt, eternal vengeance upon the <q>&#x0022;rebels,&#x0022;</q> and exhibiting at the same time his wonderful capabilities of making another glorious retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>A sentinel of <persName><foreName>Abe</foreName></persName> appears to the naked eye to the left, walking upon the top of a large framed house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>A very large schooner, with its sails in full blast, is seen lying quietly upon the bosom of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The smoke from the steamers as they run up and down the stream, indicates their course by the cloud-like columns that hang heavily above the forests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Upon the <rs type="place">Georgetown Heights</rs> appears the <name>Soldiers</name>' Home, breaking the horizon on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Its elevation and the purity of the surrounding atmosphere renders it a favorite resort for distinguished individuals during the summer season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The lofty spire of the <orgName n="Episcopal Theological Seminary" type="seminary">Episcopal Theological Seminary</orgName>, near <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, appears to the naked eye from almost every hill in this region of country, and when viewed with the telescope it shows itself to be a building of nice proportions and exquisite finish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The balloon of <persName n="Lowe,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lowe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Lowe</surname></persName> can be seen regularly twice a day making observations upon our movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> shot at it a few days ago, and it has been very cautious ever since in peeping over the trees at us. The drums of the enemy keep up almost an incessant beating day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>There are various conjectures what it all means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It has been thought that every man who threw away his gun at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> has been promoted to the office of drummer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We can hear the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> play <q>&#x0022;Dixie&#x0022;</q> upon their <orgName n="Brass Band" type="band">brass band</orgName>, and occasionally they give us a touch of <q>&#x0022;<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle.&#x0022;</q> The town clock strikes within hearing of our pickets when everything is still at night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <persName n="Munson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Munson,nomatch:0"><surname>Munson</surname></persName>'s and <placeName reg="Mason's Hills">Mason's Hills</placeName> are to the right of <placeName reg="Uptons Hill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2741436">Upton's Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Both are occupied by our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The former is almost destitute of foliage and undergrowth, while the latter is covered with large and shady trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Between these hills and the entrenchments of the enemy is comparatively a level portion of land, bare in some places and in others covered with growing crops and original forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The pickets of the <num value="2">two</num> contending armies advance several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> beyond their respective breastworks, and take every advantage possible of every stump, rock, ravine or hill to get a shot at each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The distance is so great that it rarely happens that any <num value="1">one</num> is injured by this useless kind of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is to be hoped that the officers on both sides will put a stop to this species of fighting, which resembles more the practice of the speaking savage than the open hand-to-hand fight of civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The pickets have had many a skirmish over the peach orchards between their lines. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>A correspondent of the <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia Inquirer</orgName>, in a letter dated <q>&#x0022;Off <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> after giving an account of the pursuit of the <rs>Jamestown</rs> and the stranding of the <rs>Alvarado</rs> by her crew, says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Soon after she stranded, her boats were lowered, and her crew escaped, carrying with them, no doubt, all available valuables, and leaving the bark with all sail on, to drift farther in shore, in the vain hope of afterwards getting her off or discharging her cargo in boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>By this time the <rs>Jamestown</rs> had got near enough, it was thought, to bring the bark within range of her guns, the intention being to destroy the vessel by shelling her.--The anchor was then dropped and sails furled, and the starboard guns opened upon the stranded vessel; but all the shots fell short, and, as the sea shoals very quickly along this coast, it was not deemed advisable to run in nearer the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It was then determined to take her in boats, notwithstanding the fear of there being masked batteries on shore, and which really proved to be the case; for the enemy had some very heavy ordnance mounted some short distance from the stranded vessel, and were busily engaged in bringing down some pieces of <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> to protect the bark in case she was attacked by any boats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> Everything on shore exhibited the greatest excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Companies were seen marching along the beach, pieces of artillery drawn by horses, and mounted men galloping hither and thither, made quite an exciting scene, and crowds of people lined the beach, anxiously awaiting the result of an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The boats of the <rs>Jamestown</rs> were now called away, armed and manned, and consisted of the launch, officered by <persName n="Flusser,Lieutenant-2,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Flusser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-2">Second Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Flusser</surname></persName>, (who had command of the expedition,) and accompanied by <persName n="Cleborne,Assistant-Surgeon,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Cleborne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Assistant-Surgeon">Assistant Surgeon</roleName> <surname>Cleborne</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Hewston,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Hewston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Hewston</surname></persName>, in command of the marines; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cutter, under command of <persName n="Phythian,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Phythian,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Phythian</surname></persName>, accompanied by <persName n="Chisholm,Acting-Master,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Chisholm,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Acting-Master">Acting Master</roleName> <surname>Chisholm</surname></persName>; and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> cutter, in charge of <persName n="Tyson,Midshipman,H.,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="default:Tyson,H.,B.,,"><roleName n="Midshipman">Midshipman</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Tyson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>As soon as the enemy saw the <term type="ship">boats</term> <rs type="ship">Iroisted</rs> out they were seen to arm a boat with a small piece of cannon and a party of men, evidently with the intention of boarding the bark and defending her against any attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>At the same time the shore batteries opened, it was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought, with the intention of destoying the vessel, but this was discovered not to be their object; they were merely trying the range of their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>All being ready, the cutters left the ship's side, and were soon followed by the launch, on which was mounted a boat howitzer, and was excellently manned for the occasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> As the expedition neared the bark, the launch took the lead, having her gun loaded with grape shot, and kept bearing on the vessel's deck, where it was expected that the enemy had mounted a gun, but fortunately they had not succeeded in doing so. The boats advanced in good order under a galling and most dangerous fire from the batteries on shore, round after round being fired upon them, fortunately without doing any injury; under this fire they reached the vessel's side, the balls falling pretty thickly over their heads and around them; and in a few moments the crew, headed by their gallant commander and followed by the rest of the officers, reached her deck without any opposition.--She proved to be the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Alvarado</rs>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, from the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>, and had been captured only a short time before by the <term type="ship">privateer</term> <rs type="ship">Jeff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>All the ship's papers and instruments were secured, and then finding it impossible to get her off, it was decided to set her on fire, which was efficiently done in <num value="3">three</num> places, and as her cargo consisted of Manilla rope, hemp and wool, she soon became enveloped in flames. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> About this time a gun was fired from the <rs>Jamestown</rs>, and the signal of recall hoisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Before leaving the burning vessel the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> were run up to the gaff, and then the boats shoved off as quickly as possible, as an armed steamer was steaming towards them with the intention of cutting them off from their ship; but the sloop-of-war had seen her object, and had hauled up her anchor and was running in to cover her boats with her guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The batteries on shore, which had ceased firing soon after the vessel was boarded, recommenced their cannonade, all the balls falling short of the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Soon after this, the steamer finding, if she continued the chase, she would soon be within reach of the guns of the <rs>Jamestown</rs>, turned round and made her way towards the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The boats reached the ship in safety and were hauled in, all sail was set, and the <rs>Jamestown</rs> sailed rapidly away from the scene, leaving the captors to mourn the loss of their burning prize. </p> </q><bibl n="A correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>There will be a large demand upon manufacturers for their stuffs, and upon merchants for their cottons, which must then shoot up to a price, which, if named now, would only raise a laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Let us bring a strong and conclusive argument to settle the matter once and forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Suppose unprecedented high prices were given for manufactured stuffs, and the stock of cotton so low that nothing but working short time could secure the raw material for a month at the most, why should spinners hesitate to convert it into yarns?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>When the present stock of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> is exhausted, their value will be immensely augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Then surely there is no earthly reason why spinners should not spin so long as they can buy cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>It will at once occur to every spinner who has a stock of cotton that it is the safest and most profitable course to turn it into yarn with the utmost dispatch, because, should the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war be suddenly terminated, his cotton would show a loss, but his yarns would immediately increase in value on the re-opening of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> trade. </p>
