<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The following article on the negro regiments enlisted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, is from a late number of the <orgName n="Chicago Times" type="newspaper">Chicago <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>It would appear that the experiment of making soldiers out of runaway slaves has proved a failure: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>There have been some farces of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> water enacted during the progress of this war, but there have been none so utterly absurd and ridiculous &mdash; none so destitute of the slightest result &mdash; as the mission of <persName n="Thomas,Adjutant General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> for the enlistment of negro soldiers in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>We have been amused at the venerable prattle of his printed record, and have labored hard to ascertain from it that he ever procured the enlistment of a single negro soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>It does not appear from his own words that he did, but we are charitable enough to suppose that he got a few, for it could not well happen otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>He &#x0022;organized&#x0022; <num value="20">twenty</num> regiments &mdash; that is, he appointed white officers for that number of regiments, all of whom are doubtless clamorous at the present moment for their pay. He gave them <hi rend="italics">carte blanche</hi> to enlist their recruits from the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> immigration to our lines, and succeeded so well that there are now nearly privates enough to cook the officers' victuals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> Without fear of contradiction, we assert that <persName n="Thomas,Adjutant General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s representations regarding the enlistment of a large negro military force are simple bosh and nonsense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>He cannot designate as his handiwork a single regiment of negroes on the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, and from <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> to <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> he cannot show <num value="500">five hundred</num> able-bodied black soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Knowing the facts, we speak thus confidently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>He failed to arouse the slightest disposition on the part of the negroes to become soldiers, and the majority of those who were armed and uniformed were compelled to it like cattle, and their military duties, both past and prospective, are confined to that species of drill which is best developed in the use of the frying-pan and currycomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>In no instance during his trip did this ancient apostle of negroism witness the <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> actual enlistment of a negro soldier, and we will confidently assert that, so far as his personal knowledge of the fact goes, he is entirely ignorant of the existence of such a thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>He gabbled, and gossiped his way up and down the river, and may have deluded his own feeble intellect into the belief that he left an army of negro soldiers behind him, but he never was more mistaken in his life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The complete failure which marked his attempt at the creation of a negro army was not more decisive, however, than the ruin which befell his other scheme for the cultivation of <num value="60">sixty</num> plantations by runaway negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>These plantations, abandoned by their owners, were seized by his order and placed in the hands of Northern men, who stipulated to employ the negroes in the cultivation of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The result was such as anybody but a blessed old dotard like the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> would have anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The negroes refused to work because they were not allowed to be whipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>They stole everything their new master possessed, and, to cap the climax, the guerillas swept the experimental plantations so clean that, except in a very few instances, neither negroes nor planters have ever been heard of since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>It was a wise thing to set up such a mark for ransacking guerillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>If it was to be the last piece of mischief they ever did, they would pay their respects to such an enterprise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> If anything was needed to stamp the whole affair with utter and undeniable absurdity, the action of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> in suspending the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>'s much-vaunted commissioners from duty would furnish the convincing proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>It was necessary, of course, that so great a work should be left in the hands of a &#x0022;commission.&#x0022; The entire uselessness either of the work or the commission was probably the cause of their very peremptory suspension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>They are among the things that were, and with them passed away the remotest semblance of an excuse for longer perpetrating the farce of negro enlistments in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> --The object of general interest and attention now is <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The enemy has a particular hatred for that city, and would enjoy a sweet revenge in its capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He is concentrating all the strength of enginery, naval and land, which it is in his power to bring to bear upon its defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The weight of metal that will be employed before the decision of the question whether <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> shall be taken or not, will exceed that concentrated in any of the sieges of this war, so notable for the magnitude of the means employed in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The enemy is never so completely at home as he is in such attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Let him but undertake an enterprise where his machinery and the spade are chiefly available, and he proceeds upon it with a perseverance and energy that have never been surpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>So in the essay to break through the defences of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and reach the heart of that city he is engaged in the employment that suits him best of all, if any that is war like can be said to suit him at all. The bombardment of the place will perhaps exceed anything in history of the kind.--But there are defending <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> as brave men as ever walked the earth &mdash; men who love their country, and consider it glorious to die for it. They are commanded by an officer who is <num value="1">one</num> of the best military engineers of his day, and who has earned a brilliant fame in this war. If taken at all the place will not be reached until all that man can do has been done to defend it; and we are gratified to learn from the <orgName n="Charleston Mercury" type="newspaper">Charleston <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi></orgName> that it has been determined to defend the city &#x0022;street by street, house by house, as long as there is a foot of earth left to stand upon.&#x0022;--This is in accordance with the expressed wish of the <orgName n="South Carolina Convention" type="convention">Convention of South Carolina</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, when an attack was anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>But <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> has not fallen, and there is good reason to be not, only hopeful but cheerful about its fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> --The mutiny of the <rs>Bengal Sepoys</rs> furnished the occasion of some of the most memorable exhibitions of human heroism which the world has over seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>At the time this mutiny began, the <rs>British</rs> armed force in the country was only <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> men, scattered over a vast alien territory, and encompassed by a <num value="120000">hundred and twenty thousand</num> disciplined soldiers, fighting desperately for supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>So entire was the confidence reposed by the <rs>British Government</rs> in the <name>Sepoys</name>, that it had guarded the capital city of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> with native troops only, and kept in <num value="1">one</num> of the provinces, containing <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of people, a garrison of only <num value="600">six hundred</num> <name>English</name> soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> Nor were the <name>Sepoys</name> the only enemies whom the <rs>English</rs> heroes were forced, at that critical juncture, to confront.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The season seemed to conspire with the <name>Sepoys</name> for the overthrow of <name>British</name> rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The mutineers had shrewdly chosen for the period of their outbreak that terribly hot culmination of the torrid summer, when the rays of the sun are almost as fatal to exposed <rs n="European" type="group">Europeans</rs> as <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Yet, in the face of these appalling combinations, separated far from the mother country and from each other, assailed not only by the vast Sepoy army, but in the midst of an enormous hostile population, <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> bore down, by the momentum of their moral superiority and amazing courage, the whole vast odds of this gigantic mutiny, and placed the ruling throne of <name>British</name> dominion in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> upon a foundation scarcely less stable than that of <placeName reg="Hughes, Victoria, Texas" key="tgn,2405447">Victoria</placeName>'s own dominion in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> The capture of <placeName reg="Delhi, Delaware, New York" key="tgn,2068801">Delhi</placeName> alone will stand to the end of time <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary achievements of <name>British</name> valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>A wondrous feat of arms indeed, as an English historian has pronounced it, effected by less than <num value="4000">four thousand</num> <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> against an army of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men, strongly entrenched, in possession of an inexhaustible arsenal, and well provided with everything necessary to defy assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Yet, even this was surpassed by the siege and relief of Luck now. This famous spot was not strong either by nature or art; it was no walled city like <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName> and <placeName reg="Londonderry, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063568">Londonderry</placeName>, manned by its own inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It is described as a mere range of fragile buildings, encircled by such entrenchments as could be hastily thrown up in a few days, surrounded at all points by an armed enemy and a hostile population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The garrison is said to have consisted of only a portion of <num value="1">one</num> <name>British</name> regiment, with <num value="750">seven hundred and fifty</num> loyal natives, and a motley gathering of civilians, against whom was arrayed a vast armed host of not less than <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> men, mostly trained in the <rs>British</rs> school of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Yet, for <num value="3">three</num> long and fearful months &mdash; we quote the language of a narrator of the siege--&#x0022;did our devoted countrymen maintain their hold, in hourly peril of death, exposed night and day to incessant assaults, with <num value="25">twenty-five</num> guns of large calibre playing on their frail defences, some actually within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of their position &mdash; under a constant shower of bullets from <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> loop-holes, with mines exploding every day beneath their feet, with privation and disease within, and no certain hope of relief from any quarter.&#x0022; Here is a description of <num value="1">one</num> of the most desperate assaults sustained by the garrison, from the pen of an eye-witness, <persName n="Anderson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> &#x0022;After these had been knocked over the leaders tried to urge on their men. Again and again they made the attempt, but back they had to go by a steady fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Their chiefs came to the front and shouted out: &#x0027;Come on, come on &mdash; the place is ours &mdash; it is <hi rend="italics">taken.</hi>&#x0027; And the <name>Sepoys</name> would then rush forward, then hesitate, and finally get under cover of the stockades, and keep up a fearful fire.--Some hundreds of them got under the <placeName reg="Cawnpors">Cawnpors</placeName> battery, but found the hand-grenades rather disagreeable, and had to bolt rather sharp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Poor <persName n="Banks,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName> came up and cheered us during the hottest fire, and we were glad to see him. Our shells now began to fall amongst the enemy, and this still further roused their indignation; you could hear additional <hi rend="italics">yells</hi> and horrid imprecations on the heads of all <persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>No less than <num value="3">three</num> times were we assaulted by enormous odds against us and each attack was, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, successfully repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>There we were, a little body, probably not more than <num value="80">eighty</num> men in all, (that is, <placeName reg="Cawnpore battery">Cawnpore battery</placeName>, our post, and <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> <rs n="German" type="group">German's</rs>,) opposed to several <num value="1000">thousand</num> of merciless, blood-thirsty fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>We well knew what we had to expect if we were defeated; and therefore each individual fought, as it were for his very life; each loop-hols displayed a steady flash of <unclear>mu </unclear>, as defeat would have been certain death to every soul in the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Had the <unclear></unclear> fallen, they were in such immense <unclear></unclear> that we could never have turned the <unclear></unclear> and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> not a man, woman, or child would have been spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>It was, indeed, <unclear></unclear> time, and the more so as we did <unclear></unclear> were progressing at <unclear></unclear> that the others <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> might have been even further pressed than we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>At intervals I heard the cry of &#x0027;more men this way,&#x0027; and off would rush <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> (all we could possibly spare) here and there; and then the same cry was repeated in an opposite direction, and then the men had to rush to support their comrades who were more hotly pressed, and soon as the pressure became greater at particular places men rushed to those spots to give assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>During this trying time even the poor wounded men ran out of the hospitals, and those who had wounds in the legs threw away their crutches, knelt down, and fired as fast as they could out of the loop-holes, others, who could do little else, loaded the muskets whilst the able-bodied soldiers fired, and in this odd manner these brave men of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> <num value="32" type="ordinal">thirty-second</num> upheld the honor of their nation, and strained every nerve to repel the furious attacks of the enemy.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> The minor episodes of the war, in a <num value="100">hundred</num> isolated stations, bore equal testimony to the heroic spirit and endurance of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Whether successful, as at <placeName reg="Lucknow, Lee, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096170">Lucknow</placeName>, or crushed down by <num value="40">forty</num> times their numbers, as at <placeName key="tgn,7001527" n="1.000 10" reg="Kanpur,Uttar Pradesh,Bharat,Asia">Cawnpore</placeName>, they fought to the last ditch, and defied every adverse conjunction of numbers, position, or season. &#x0022;Of numbers, indeed, there was no account, for the prayer of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7016442;tgn,1003918" n="0.012 000000.2480	placename;tgn,7016442;Azincourt,Pas-de-Calais,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,France,Europe,Pas-de-Calais,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,France,Europe;0.006 000000.1240	placename;tgn,1003918;Agincourt,Toronto,Toronto Metropolitan Area,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America,Toronto,Toronto Metropolitan Area,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="Azincourt,Pas-de-Calais,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,France,Europe,Pas-de-Calais,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,France,Europe;Agincourt,Toronto,Toronto Metropolitan Area,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America,Toronto,Toronto Metropolitan Area,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Agincourt</placeName> seemed to have been granted to them in this time of mortal peril, and a sense of reckoning was taken from them.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> We are not advocating the cause in which these miracles of heroism were displayed, but holding up the heroism itself as an example and incentive to the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Admitting the cause to have been bad, what ought not Southern soldiers to accomplish in a good cause?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The same blood warms their veins that has illustrated the glory and valor of the <rs>British</rs> race in every clime, and they have proved in a <num value="100">hundred</num> battle-fields that they are not degenerate sons of heroic sires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Let them continue steadfast to the end, and be incited by the examples we have quoted to surpass themselves, and make <name>British</name> laurels in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> pale by the side of Southern chivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>He was born in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--it may be said that he died in and for <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and that the's me soil which gave him birth received him back into her breast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> At the breaking out of this wicked war, young <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McWilliams,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:McWilliams,nomatch:0"><surname>McWilliams</surname></persName></hi> was a telegraphic operator in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The Lincoln Government submitted to him <num value="1">one</num> of its oaths of allegiance, which he refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Then he resolved upon entering the <rs>Southern</rs> service, and his widowed mother offered him, with an older brother and her daughter's husband, as soldiers to the sacred cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>So, in his <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> year, he reached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, entered the service in his brother-in-law's (<persName n="Clarke,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Clarke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>) company, the &#x0022;Lanier Guards,&#x0022;--a company wholly composed of Baltimoreans, but composing then a part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="13VARegiment">13th Virginia regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The Lanier Guards were a <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> company, and, upon the expiration of their term, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McWilliams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:McWilliams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McWilliams</surname></persName></hi> was discharged; but he immediately re-enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Here he continued, beloved by all who knew him. He was distinguished by every genial trait of character which makes youth lovely and endearing; he was tender, affectionate, kind-hearted, generous, unselfish, noble-souled, chivalrous, and brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>In him the service has lost a gallant soldier; his companions a cheerful and faithful friend; his relatives an ornament to every virtuous and natural attachment, and his widowed mother a son who never once forgot the final piety and duty which hallows youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> consolation &mdash; his death was glorious, as his life was beautiful; and the snows of a winter and the flowers of a summer may robe the patriots grave, but from that grave there shall be resurrection. </p> </div3> </div2>
