<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/> Throughout the year, since our last meeting, the country has been eminently prosperous in all its material interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The general health has been excellent; our harvests have been abundant, and plenty smiles throughout the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Our commerce and manufactures have been prosecuted with energy and industry, and have yielded fair and ample returns, in short, no nation in the tide of time has ever presented a spectacle of greater material prosperity than we have done until within a very <unclear>ent</unclear> period. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/> Why is it, then, that discontent now so extensively prevails, and the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName>, which is the sources of all those blessings, is <unclear></unclear> with destruction!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The long <unclear>con </unclear> and intemperate interference of the <rs>Northern</rs> people with the question of slavery in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, has at length produced is natural effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The different sections of the <rs>Union</rs> are now arrayed against each other, and the time has arrived, so much dreaded by the father of his Country, when hostile geographical parties have been formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>I have long <unclear>for </unclear> and often forewarned my countrymen of the now impending danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This does not proceed solely from the claim on the pass of Congress or the territorial legislatures so exclude slavery from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, nor from the efforts of different States to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law. All <unclear></unclear> say of these evils might have been endured by the <rs>South</rs> without danger to the <rs>Union</rs>, (as others have been.) in the hope that those and reflection might apply the remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The immediate peril arises not so much from these causes as from the fact that the <unclear>inces </unclear> violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the <rs>North</rs> for the last quarter of a century, has at length produced its malign influence on the slaves, and inspired them with vague nations of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Hence a sense of security no longer exists around the family star.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This feeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Many a matron throughout the <rs>South</rs> retires at night in dread of what may be fill herself and her children before the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Should it is apprehension of domestic danger, whether real or imaginary, extend and intensity itself <unclear></unclear> shall pervade the masses of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, then disunion will become <unclear></unclear> Soft-preservation is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> law of nation, and has been implanted in the heart of <unclear></unclear> by his Creator for the wisest purpose; and no political union, however fraught with <unclear>sings</unclear> and benefits in all other respects, can <unclear></unclear> continue, if the necessary consequence <unclear></unclear> to render the homes and the firesides of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly insecure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Sooner or later the bonds at such a Union must be severed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is my conviction that this fatal period has not yet arrived; and my prayer to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is that He would preserve the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> throughout all generations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> But let us take warning in time, and remove the cause of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It cannot be dented that, for <num value="5">five</num> and <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, the agitate on at the <rs>North</rs> against slavery in the <rs>South</rs> has been incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct> pictorial hand-bills, and inflammatory appeals, were circulated extensively throughout the <rs>South</rs>, of a character to excite the passions of the slaves; and, in the language of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,J.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, &#x0022;to stimulate them to insurrection, and produce all the horrors of a servile war.&#x0022; This agitation has ever since been continued by the public press, by the proceedings of State and county conventions, and by abolition sermons and lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The time of Congress has been occupied in violent speeches on this never-ending subject; <unclear></unclear> appeals in pamphlet and other forms, enclosed by distinguished names, have been sent forth from this central point, and spread broadcast over the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> How easy would it be for the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people to settle the slavery question forever, and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> They, and they alone, can do it. All that is necessary to accomplish the object, and all for which the slave States have ever contended, is to be let alone, and permitted to manage their domestic institutions in their own way. As sovereign States, they, and they alone, are responsible before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the world for the slavery existing among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>For this the people of the <rs>North</rs> are not more responsible, and have no more right to interfere, than with similar institutions in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> or in <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>.--Upon their good sense and patriotic forbearance I confess I still greatly rely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Without their aid, it is beyond the power of any <rs type="role2">President</rs>, no matter what may be his own political proclivities, to restore peace and harmony among the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Wisely limited and <unclear>re </unclear> as is his power, under our Constitution and laws, he alone can accomplish but a little for good or for evil, on such a momentous question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> And this brings me to observe that the election of any <num value="1">one</num> of our fellow citizens to the <orgName>office of President</orgName> does not of itself afford just cause for dissolving the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This is more especially true if his election has been effected by a mere plurality, and not a majority, of the people, and has resulted from transient and temporary causes, which may probably never again occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In order to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance, the <rs>Federal Government</rs> must be guilty of &#x0022;a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise&#x0022; of powers not granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The late presidential selection, however, has been held in strict conformity with its express provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>How, then, can the result justify a revolution to <unclear>de </unclear> this very Constitution ! Reason, justice, a regard for the <rs>Constitution</rs>, all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous <unclear></unclear> on the part of the <rs type="role" reg="President elect">President elect</rs> before resorting to such a remedy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It is said, however, that the antecedents of the <rs type="role" reg="President elect">President elect</rs> have been sufficient to justify the fears of the <rs>South</rs> that he will attempt to invade their constitutional rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But are each apprehensions of contingent danger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the noblest system of government ever devised by mortals!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>From the very nature of his office, and its high responsibilities, he must necessity be conservative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The stern duty of administering the vast and complicated concerns of this Government affords in itself a guarantee that he will not attempt any violation of a clear constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>After all, he is no more than the chief executive officer of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>His province is not to make, but to execute, the laws; and it is a remarkable fact in our history, that, not withstanding the repeated efforts of the anti-slavery party, no single act has ever passed Congress, unless we may possibly except the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, impairing, in the slightest degree, the rights of the <rs>South</rs> to their property in slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>And it may also be observed, judging from present indications, that no probability exists of he passage of such an act, by a majority of both Houses, either in the present or the next Congress.--Surely, under these circumstances, we ought to be restrained from present action by the precept of him who spoke as never man spoke, that &#x0022;sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.&#x0022; The day of evil may never come, unless we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> It is alleged as <num value="1">one</num> cause for immediate secession that the <rs>Southern States</rs> are denied equal rights with the other States in the common <rs>Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But by what authority are these denied!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Not by Congress, which has never passed, and I believe never will pass, any a <unclear></unclear> exclude slavery from these Territories; and certainly not by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, which has solemnly decided that slaves are property, and, like all other property, their owners have a right to take them into the common <rs>Territories</rs>, and hold them there under the protection of the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> So far, then, as Congress is concerned, the objection is not to anything they have already done, but to what they may do hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It will surely be admitted that this apprehension of future danger is no good reason for an immediate dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It is true that the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">territorial legislature of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName></orgName>, on the <date value="1860-02-23">23d of February, 1860,</date> passed, in great basic, an act, over the vote of the <rs>Governor</rs>, declaring that slavery &#x0022;is, and shall be, forever prohibited in this Territory.&#x0022; Such an act, however, plainly violating the rights of property secured by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, will surely be declared void by the judiciary whenever it shall be presented in a legal form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Only <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> after my inauguration the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> solemnly adjudged that this power did not exist in a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">territorial legislature</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Yet such has been the factions temper of the times that the correctness of this decision has been extensively impugned before the people, and the question has given rise to angry political conflicts throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Those who have appealed from this judgment of our highest constitutional tribunal to popular assemblies, would, if they could, invest a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">territorial legislature</orgName> with power to annul the sacred rights of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This power Congress is expressly forbidden by the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> to exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Every <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State legislature</orgName> in the <rs>Union</rs> is forbidden by its own constitution to exercise it. It cannot be exercised in any State except by the people in their highest sovereign capacity when framing or amending their State constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In like manner, it can only be exercised by the people of a Territory represented in a <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">convention of delegates</orgName> for the purpose of framing a constitution preparatory to admission as a State into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Then, and not until then, are they invested with power to decide the question whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This is an act of sovereign authority, and not of subordinate territorial legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Were it otherwise, then indeed would the equality of the <name>States</name> in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> be destroyed, and the rights of property in slaves would depend, not upon the guarantees of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but upon the shifting majorities of an irresponsible <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">territorial legislature</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Such a doctrine, from its intrinsic unsoundness, cannot long influence any considerable portion of our people, much less can it afford a good reason for a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> The most palpable violations of constitutional duty which have yet been committed consist in the acts of different State legislatures to defeat the execution of the fugitive <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> slave law. It ought to be remembered, however, that for these acts, neither Congress nor any <rs type="role2">President</rs> can justly be held responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Having been passed in violation of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, they are therefore null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>All the courts, both State and national, before whom the question has arisen, have from the beginning declared the fugitive slave law to be constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The single exception is that of a <orgName n="State Court" type="court">State court</orgName> in <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>; and this has not only been reversed by the proper appellate tribunal, but has met with such universal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The validity of this law has been established over and over again by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> with perfect unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It is founded upon an express provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs> requiring that fugitive slaves who escape from service in <num value="1">one</num> State to another shall be &#x0022;delivered up&#x0022; to their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Without this provision it is a well-known historical fact that the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself could never have been adopted by the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>In <num value="1">one</num> form or other under the acts of <date value="1793">1793</date> and <date value="1850">1850,</date> both being substantially the same, the fugitive slave law has been the law of the land from the days of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> until the present moment.--Here, then, a clear case is presented, in which it will be the duty of the next <rs>President</rs>, as it has been my own, to act with vigor in executing this supreme law against the conflicting enactments of State Legislatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Should he fail in the performance of this high duty, he will then have manifested a disregard of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws, to the great injury of the people of nearly <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But are we to presume in advance that he will thus violate his duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>This would be at war with every principle of justice and of <name>Christian</name> charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Let us wait for the overt act. The fugitive slave law has been carried into execution in every contested case since the commencement of the present administration; though often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It is to be regretted, with great loss and inconvenience to the master, and with considerable expense to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Let us trust that the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> will repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Unless this shall be done without unnecessary delay it is impossible for any human power to save the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> The Southern States, standing on the basis of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, have a right to demand this act of justice from the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Should it be refused, then the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to which all the <name>States</name> are parties, will have been willfully violated by <num value="1">one</num> portion of them in a provision essential to the domestic security and happiness of the remainder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In that event, the injured States, after having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> I have purposely confined my remarks to revolutionary resistance, because it has been claimed within the last few years that any State, whenever this shall be its sovereign will and pleasure, may secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, in accordance with the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and without any violation of the constitutional rights of the other members of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>That as each became parties to the <rs>Union</rs> by the vote of its own people assembled in Convention, so any <num value="1">one</num> of them may retire from the <rs>Union</rs> in a similar manner by the vote of such a convention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy, it must be on the principle that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any <num value="1">one</num> of the contracting parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>If this be so, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is a rope of sand, to be penetrated and dissolved by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adverse wave of public opinion in any of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In this manner our <num value="33">thirty-three</num> States may resolve themselves into as many petty jarring, and hostile republics, each <num value="1">one</num> retiring from the <rs>Union</rs>, without responsibility, whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>By this process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments in a few weeks, which cost our forefathers many years of toil, privation, and blood to establish. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Such a principle is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>After it was framed, with the greatest deliberation and care, it was submitted to conventions of the people of the several States for ratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Its provisions were discussed at length in these bodies, composed of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> men of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Its opponents contended that it conferred powers upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs> dangerous to the rights of the <name>States</name>, whilst its advocates maintained that under a fair construction of the instrument there was no foundation for such apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>In that mighty struggle between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intellects of this or any other country, it never occurred to any individual, either among its opponents or advocates, to assert, or even to intimate, that their efforts were all vain labor, because the moment that any State felt herself aggrieved she might secede from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>What a crushing argument would this have proved against those who dreaded that the rights of the <name>States</name> would be endangered by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.--The truth is, that it was not until many years after the origin of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> that such a proposition was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advanced.--It was then met and refuted by the conclusive arguments of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00003" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,J.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who in his message of <date value="1833-01-16">16th January, 1833,</date> transmitting the nullifying ordinance of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to Congress, employs the following language:--&#x0022;The right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will, and without the consent of the other States, from their most solemn obligations, and hazard the liberty and happiness of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> composing this Union, cannot be acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Such authority is believed to be utterly repugnant both to the principles upon which the <rs>General Government</rs> is constituted and to the objects which it was expressly formed to attain.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> It is not pretended that any clause in the <rs>Constitution</rs> gives countenance to such a theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It is altogether founded upon inference, not from any language contained in the instrument itself, but from the sovereign character of the several States by which it was ratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But is it beyond the power of a State, like an individual, to yield a portion of its sovereign rights to secure the remainder!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>In the language of <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, who has been called the father of the <rs>Constitution</rs>: &#x0022;It was formed by the <name>States</name>--that is, by the people in each of the <name>States</name>, acting in their highest sovereign capacity; and formed consequently by the same authority which formed the <rs>State Constitutions</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> &#x0022;Nor is the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, created by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, less a Government in the strict sense of the term, within the sphere of its powers, than the governments created by the constitutions of the <name>States</name> are, within their several spheres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It is, like them, organized into legislative, executive, and judiciary departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It operates, like them, directly on persons and things; and, like them, it has at command a physical force for executing the powers committed to it.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> It was intended to be perpetual, and not to be annulled at the pleasure of any <num value="1">one</num> of the contracting parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The old articles of confederation were entitled &#x0022;Articles of Confederation and <orgName n="Perpetual Union" type="union">Perpetual Union</orgName> between the <name>States</name>;&#x0022; and by the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> article it is expressly declared that &#x0022;the articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the <rs>Union</rs> shall be perpetual&#x0022; The preamble to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, having express reference to the articles of Confederation, recites that it was established &#x0022;in order to form a more perfect union.&#x0022; And yet it is contended that this &#x0022;more perfect union&#x0022; does not include the essential attribute of perpetuity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> But, that the <rs>Union</rs> was designed to be perpetual appears conclusively from the nature and extent of the powers conferred by the <rs>Constitution</rs> on the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.--These powers embrace the very highest attributes of national sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>They place both the sword and the purse under its control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Congress has power to make war and to make peace; to raise and support armies and navies, and to conclude treaties with foreign governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It is invested with the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof, and to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It is not necessary to enumerate the other high powers which have been conferred upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>In order to carry the enumerated powers into effect, Congress possesses the exclusive right to lay and collect duties on imports, and in common with the <name>States</name> to lay and collect all other taxes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> But the <rs>Constitution</rs> has not only conferred these high powers upon Congress, but it has adopted effectual means to restrain the <name>States</name> from interfering with their exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>For that purpose it has, in strong prohibitory language, expressly declared that &#x0022;no State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and <rs n="silver coin" type="product">silver coin</rs> a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder <hi rend="italics">exposit factor</hi> law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.&#x0022; Moreover, &#x0022;without the consent of Congress, no State shall lay any imposts or duties on any imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws;&#x0022; and, if they exceed this amount, the excess shall belong to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> And &#x0022;no State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage; keep troops or ships of war, in time of peace; enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power; or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> In order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high powers against State interposition, it is provided &#x0022;that this Constitution and the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> under the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, shall be the supreme law of the land: and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> The solemn sanction of religion has been superadded to the obligations of official duty, and all senators and representatives of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, all members of State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, &#x0022;both of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the several States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> In order to carry into effect these powers, the <rs>Constitution</rs> has established a perfect Government in all its forms, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial; and this Government, to the extent of its powers, acts directly upon the individual citizens of every State, and executes its own decrees by the agency of its own officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>In this respect it differs entirely from the <rs>Government</rs> under the old Confederation, which was confined to making requisitions on the <name>States</name> in their sovereign character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>This left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse, and they often declined to comply with such requisitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>It thus became necessary, for the purpose of removing this barrier, and &#x0022;in order to form a more perfect Union,&#x0022; to establish a Government which could act directly upon the people, and execute its own laws without the intermediate agency of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>This has been accomplished by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> In short, the <rs>Government</rs> created by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and deriving its authority from the sovereign people of each of the several States, has precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all these States, in the enumerated cases, that each <num value="1">one</num> of them possesses over subjects not delegated to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but &#x0022;reserved to the <name>States</name>, respectively, or to the people.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> To the extent of the delegated powers the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> is as much a part of the constitution of each State, and is as binding upon its people, as though it had been <unclear> exinally</unclear> inserted therein. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> This Government, therefore, is a great and powerful Government, invested with all the attributes of sovereignty over the special subjects to which its authority extends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Its framers never intended to implant in its bosom the seeds of its own destruction, nor were they at its creation guilty of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>It was not intended by its framers to be the base less fabric of a vision which, at the touch of the enchanter, would vanish into thin air, but a substantial and mighty fabric, capable of resisting the slow decay of time and of defying the storms of ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Indeed, well may the jealous patriots of that day have indulged fears that a government of such high powers might violate the reserved rights of the <name>States</name>, and wisely did they adopt the rule of a strict construction of these powers to prevent the danger!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>But they did not fear, nor had they any reason to imagine, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> would ever be so interpreted as to enable any State, by her own act, and without the consent of her sister States, to discharge her people from all or any of their Federal obligations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> It may be asked, then, are the people of the <name>States</name> without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>By no means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The right of resistance on the part of the governed against the oppression of their governments cannot be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It exists independently of all constitutions, and has been exercised at all periods of the world's history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Under it old governments have been destroyed, and new ones have taken their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>It is embodied in strong and express language in our own <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>But the distinction must ever be observed, that this is revolution against an established Government, and not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of an inherent constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>In short, let us look the danger fairly in the face: Secession is neither more nor less than revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It may or it may not be a justifiable revolution, but still it is revolution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> What, in the meantime, is the responsibility and true position of the <rs>Executive</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>He is bound by solemn oath before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the country, &#x0022;to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,&#x0022; and from this obligation he cannot be absolved by any human power.--But what if the performance of this duty, in whole or in part, has been rendered impracticable by events over which he could have exercised no control?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Such, at the present moment, is the case throughout the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, so far as the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to secure the administration of justice by means of the <rs>Federal Judiciary</rs> are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>All the <rs>Federal</rs> officers within its limits, through whose agency alone these laws can be carried into execution, have already resigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>We no longer have a district judge a district attorney, or a marshal, in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>In fact, the whole machinery of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, necessary for the distribution of remedial justice among the people, has been demolished; and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> The only acts of Congress on the statute-book, bearing upon this subject, are those of the <date value="1795-02-28">28th February, 1795,</date> and <date value="1807-03-03">3d March, 1807.</date> These authorize the <rs>President</rs>, after he shall have ascertained that the marshal with his <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">posse comitatus</hi></foreign> is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case, to call forth the militia and employ the army and navy to aid him in performing this service, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by Proclamation commanded the insurgents &#x0022;to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limited time.&#x0022; This duty cannot by possibility be performed in a State where no judicial authority exists to issue process, and where there is no marshal to execute it; and where, even it there were such an officer, the entire population would constitute <num value="1">one</num> solid combination to resist him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> The bare enumeration of these provisions proves how inadequate they are without further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single State, not to speak of other States who may place themselves in a similar attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry out more effectually the objects of the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> The same insuperable obstacles do not lie in the way of executing the laws for the collection of the customs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The revenue still continues to be collected, as heretofore, at the custom house in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; and should the collector unfortunately resign, a successor may be appointed to perform this duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> Then in regard to the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>This has been purchased for a fair equivalent, &#x0022;by the consent of the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">legislature of the State</orgName>,&#x0022; &#x0022;for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals.&#x0022; &#x0026;c, and over these the authority &#x0022;to exercise exclusive legislation&#x0022; has been expressly granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from this property by force; but it in this I should prove to be mistaken, the officer in command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>In such a contingency, the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the head of the assailants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Apart from the execution of the laws, so far as this may be practicable, the <rs>Executive</rs> has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>He has been invested with no such discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>He possesses no power to change the relations heretofore existing between them, much less to acknowledge the independence of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>This would be to invest a mere Executive officer with the power of recognizing the dissolution of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> among our <num value="33">thirty-three</num> sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It bears no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> government, involving no such responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Any attempt to do this would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It is, therefore, my duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all its bearings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The course of events is so rapidly hastening forward, that the emergency may soon arise, when you may be called upon to decide the momentous question whether you possess the power, by force of arms, to compel a State to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>I should feel myself recreant to my duty were I not to express an opinion on this important subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> The question fairly stated is: Has the <rs>Constitution</rs> delegated to Congress the power to coerce a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw or has actually withdrawn from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>If answered in the affirmative, it must be on the principle that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and to make war against a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>After much serious reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or to any other department of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>It is manifest, upon an inspection of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that this is not among the specific and enumerated powers granted to Congress; and it is equally apparent that its exercise is not &#x0022;necessary and proper for carrying into execution&#x0022; any <num value="1">one</num> of these powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>So far from this power having been delegated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the convention which framed the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> It appears, from the proceedings of that body, that on the <date value="1787-05-31">31st May, 1787,</date> the clause, <hi rend="italics">&#x0022;authorizing an exertion of the force of the whole against a delinquent State&#x0022;</hi> come up for consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/><persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> opposed it in a brief but powerful speech, from which I shall extract but a single sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>He observed; &#x0022;The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment; and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound.&#x0022; Upon his motion the clause was unanimously postponed, and was never, I believe, again presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Soon afterwards, on the <date value="1787-06-08">8th June, 1787,</date> when incidentally adverting to the subject, he said; &#x0022;Any Government <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, formed on the supposed practicability of using force against the unconstitutional proceedings of the <name>States</name>, would prove as visionary and fallacious as the government of Congress,&#x0022; evidently meaning the then existing Congress of the old Confederation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> Without descending to particulars, it may be safely asserted, that the power to make war against a State is at variance with the whole spirit and intent of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a State, how are we to govern it afterwards?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Shall we hold it as a province, and govern it by despotic power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>In the nature of things we could not, by physical force, control the will of the people, and compel them to elect senators and representatives to Congress, and to perform all the other duties depending upon their own volition, and required from the free citizens of a free State as a constituent member of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> But, if we possessed this power, would it be wise to exercise it under existing circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The object would doubtless be to preserve the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>War would not only present the most effectual means of destroying it; but would banish all hope of its peace able reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Besides, in the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expended, rendering future reconciliation between the <name>States</name> impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>In the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The fact is, that our Union rests upon public opinion, and can never be cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it cannot live in the affections of the people, it must <num value="1">one</num> day perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Congress possess many means of preserving it by conciliation; but the sword was not placed in their hand to preserve it by force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countrymen to pause and deliberate, before they determine to destroy this, the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began ! It has been consecrated by the blood of our fathers, by the glories of the past, and by the hopes of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The Union has already made us the most prosperous and, are long, will if preserved, render us the most powerful nation on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>In every foreign region of the globe the title of <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName> is held in the highest respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell with honest pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Surely when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss, we shall recall with horror from the last fatal plunge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>By such a dread catastrophe the hopes of the friends of freedom throughout the world would be destroyed, and a long night of leaden despotism would enshroud the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Our example for more than <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> would not only be lost; but it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for self-government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> It is not every wrong &mdash; nay, it is not every grievous wrong &mdash; which can justify a resort to such a fearful alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>This ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people, after every other constitutional means of conciliation had been exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>We should reflect that under this free Government there is an incessant ebb and flow in public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The slavery question, like everything human, will have its day. I firmly believe that it has already reached and passed the culminating point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>But if, in the midst of the existing excitement, the <rs>Union</rs> shall perish, the evil may then become irreparable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Congress can contribute much to avert it by proposing and recommending to the legislatures of the several States the remedy for existing evils, which the <rs>Constitution</rs> has itself provided for its own preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>This has been tried at different critical periods of our history, and always with eminent success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It is to be found in the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> article providing for its own amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Under this article amendments have been proposed by <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of both houses of Congress, and have been &#x0022;ratified by the legislatures of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the several States,&#x0022; and have consequently become parts of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>To this process the country is indebted for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing any law respecting an establishment of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or of the right of petition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>To this we are, also, indebted for the <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">Bill of Rights</rs>, which secures the people against any abuse of power by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Such were the apprehensions justly entertained by the friends of State Rights at that period as to have rendered it extremely doubtful whether the <rs>Constitution</rs> could have long survived without these amendments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> Again, the <rs>Constitution</rs> was amended by the same process after the election of <persName n="Jefferson,President,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Joseph,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, in <date value="1803-02">February, 1803.</date> This amendment was rendered necessary to prevent a recurrence of the dangers which had seriously threatened the existence of the <rs>Government</rs> during the pendency of that election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The article for its own amendment was intended to secure the amicable adjustment of conflicting constitutional questions like the present, which might arise between the governments of the <name>States</name> and that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>This appears from contemporaneous history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>In this connection, I shall merely call attention to a few sentences in <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>'s justly celebrated report, in <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>, to the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">legislature of Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>In this he ably and conclusively defended the resolutions of the preceding legislature against the strictures of several other State legislatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>These were mainly founded upon the protest of the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia legislature</orgName> against the &#x0022;After and Sedition Acts,&#x0022; as &#x0022;palpable and alarming infractions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.&#x0022; In pointing out the peaceful and constitutional remedies, and be referred to none other, to which the <name>States</name> were authorized to resort, on such occasions, he concludes by saying, &#x0022;that the legislatures of the <name>States</name> might have made a direct representation to Congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the <num value="2">two</num> offensive acts, or they might have represented to their respective senators in Congress their wish that <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> thereof would propose an explanatory amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of themselves, if such had been their option, might, by an application to Congress, have obtained a convention for the same object.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> This is the very course which I earnestly recommend in order to obtain an &#x0022;explanatory amendment&#x0022; of the <rs>Constitution</rs> on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>This might originate with Congress or the <rs>State</rs> legislatures, as may be deemed most advisable to attain the object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> The explanatory amendment might be confluent to the final settlement of the true construction of the <rs>Constitution</rs> on <num value="3">three</num> special points: </p> 
<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>an express recognition of the right of property in slaves in the <name>States</name> where it now exists, or may hereafter exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2">2</num>. The duty of protecting this right in all the common <rs>Territories</rs> throughout their territorial existence, and until the shall be admitted as States into the <rs>Union</rs>, with or without slavery, as their constitutions may prescribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/></item>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The Spanish government finally agreed to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these claims, and on the <date value="1860-03-05">5th day of March, 1860,</date> concluded a convention for this purpose with our present minister at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> Our relations with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> remain in a most unsatisfactory condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>In my last <num value="2">two</num> annual messages I discussed extensively the subject of these relations, and do not now propose to repeat at length the facts and arguments then presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>They prove concessively that our citizens residing in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and our merchants trading thereto had suffered a series of wrongs and outrages such as we have never patiently borne from any other nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>For these our successful ministers, invoking the faith of treaties, had, in the name of their country, persistently demanded redress and identification, but without the <unclear> est</unclear> effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Indeed, so confident had the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> an horatius become of our patient endurance, that they universally believed they might commit these outrages upon <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens with <unclear></unclear> impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Thus wrote our minister in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, and expressed the opinion that &#x0022;nothing <unclear></unclear> a manifestation of the power of the <rs>Government</rs>, and of its purpose to punish these wrongs, will avail.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> Afterwards, in <date value="1857">1857,</date> came the adoption of a new constitution for <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, the election of a President and Congress under its provisions, and the inauguration of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>With in <num value="1">one</num> short month, however, this <rs type="role2">President</rs> was expelled from the capital by a rebellious in the army, and the supreme power of the republic was assigned to <persName n="Zuloaga,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Zuloaga,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Zuloaga</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> Throughout the year <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> the constitutional party grew stronger and stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>In the previous history of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> a successful military revolution at the capital had almost universally been the signal for submission throughout the republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Not so on the present occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>A majority of the citizens persistently sustained the constitutional government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>When this was recognized, in <date value="1859-04">April, 1859,</date> by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, its authority extended over a large majority of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> States and people, including <placeName reg="Veracruz, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005599">Vera Cruz</placeName> and all the other important seaports of the republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>From that period our commerce with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> began to revive, and the constitutional government has afforded it all the protection in their power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> Meanwhile, the government of <persName n="Miramon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Miramon,nomatch:0"><surname>Miramon</surname></persName> still held sway at the capital and over the surrounding country, and continued its outrages against the few <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens who still had the courage to remain within its power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>To cap the climax: After the battle of <placeName reg="Tacubaya, Chihuahua, Mexico" key="tgn,1018368">Tacubaya</placeName>, in <date value="1859-04">April, 1859,</date> <persName n="Marquez,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Marquez,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Marquez</surname></persName> ordered <num value="3">three</num> citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--<num value="2">two</num> of them physicians &mdash; to be seized in the hospital at that place, taken out and shot, without crime and without trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>This was done, notwithstanding our unfortunate countrymen were at the moment engaged in the holy cause of affording relief to the soldiers of both parties who had been wounded in the battle, without making any distinction between them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> The time had arrived, in my opinion, when this Government was bound to exert its power to avenge and redress the wrongs of our citizens and to afford them protection in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The interposing obstacle was that the portion of the country under the sway of <persName n="Miramon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Miramon,nomatch:0"><surname>Miramon</surname></persName> could not be reached without passing over territory under the jurisdiction of the constitutional government.-- Under these circumstances, I deemed it my duty to recommend to Congress, in my last annual message, the employment of a sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior, where the government of <persName n="Miramon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Miramon,nomatch:0"><surname>Miramon</surname></persName> was to be found, with, or, if need be, without the consent of the <name>Juarez</name> government, though it was not doubted that this consent could be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Never have I had a clearer conviction on any subject than of the justice as well as wisdom of such a policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>No other alternative was left, except the entire abandonment of our fellow-citizens who had gone to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, under the faith of treaties, to the systematic injustice, cruelty, and oppression of <persName n="Miramon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Miramon,nomatch:0"><surname>Miramon</surname></persName>'s government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Besides, it is almost certain that the simple authority to employ this force would of itself have accomplished all our objects without striking a single blow.-- The constitutional government would then are this have been established at the city of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and would have been ready and willing, to the extent of its ability, to do as justice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> In addition &mdash; and I seem this a most important consideration--<rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> governments would have been deprived of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concerns of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>We should thus have been relieved from the obligation of restating, even by force, should this become necessary, any attempt by these governments to deprive our neighboring republic of portions of her territory; a duty from which we could not shrink without abandoning the traditional and established policy of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>I am happy to observe, that, firmly relying upon <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> the justice and good faith of these governments, there is no present danger that such a contingency will happen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> Having discovered that my recommendations would not be sustained by Congress, the next alternative was to accomplish, in some degree, if possible, the same objects by treaty stipulations with the constitutional government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Such treaties were accordingly concluded by our late able and excellent minister to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and on the <date value="01-04">4th of January</date> last were submitted to the <name>Senate</name> for ratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>As these have not yet received the final action of that body, it would be improper for me to present a detailed statement of their provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Still I may be permitted to express the opinion in advance that they are calculated to promote the agricultural, manufacturing and commercial interests of the country, and to secure our just influence with an adjoining republic as to whose fortunes and fate we can never feel indifferent; whilst at the same time they provide for the payment of a considerable amount towards the satisfaction of the claims of our injured fellow citizens. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> At the period of my <unclear> gerafion</unclear> I was confronted in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> by a revolutionary government, existing under what is called the <rs>Topeka</rs> constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Its avowed object was to subdue the territorial government by force, and to inaugurate what was called the <rs>Topeka</rs> government in its stead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>To accomplish this object, an extensive military organization was formed and its command entrusted to the most violent revolutionary leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Under these circumstances, it became my imperative duty <unclear></unclear> exert the whole constitutional power of the <rs>Executive</rs> to prevent the flames of civil war from again raging in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, which, in the excited state of the public mind, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, might have extended into the neighboring States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> The hostile parties in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> had been inflamed against each other by emissaries both from the <rs>North</rs> and The South, to a degree of malignity without parallel in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>To prevent actual collision, and to assist the civil magistrates in enforcing the laws, a strong detachment of the army was stationed in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, ready to aid the marshal and his <unclear>depa </unclear> when lawfully called upon, as a <hi rend="italics">posse comitatus</hi> in the execution of civil and criminal process. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> Still, the troubles in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> could not have been permanently settled without an election by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The ballot box is the surest artery of disputes among freemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Under this conviction, every proper effort was employed to induce the hostile parties to vote at the election of delegates to frame a State constitution, and afterwards at the election to decide whether <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should be a slave or a tree State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The insurgent party refused to vote at either, last this might be considered a recognition on their part of the territorial government established by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>A better spirit, however, seemed soon after to prevail, and the <num value="2">two</num> part as met face to face at the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> election, held on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <date value="1858-01">Monday of January, 1858,</date> for members of the legislature and State officers under the <name>Lecompton</name> constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The result was the triumph of the anti-slavery party at the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>This decision of the ballot-box proved clearly that this party were in the majority, and removed the danger of civil war. From that time we have heard little or nothing of the <rs>Topeka</rs> government; and all serious danger of revolutionary troubles in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> was then at an end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> The <placeName key="tgn,2036684" n="1.000 1" reg="lecompton, douglas, kansas">Lecompton</placeName> constitution, which had been thus recognized at this State election by the votes of both political parties in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, was transmitted to me with the request that I should present it to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>This I could not have refused to do without violating my clearest and strongest convictions of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The constitution, and all the proceedings which preceded and followed its formation, were fair and regularly on their face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>I then believe, and experience has proved that the interests of the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> would have been best consulted by its admission as a State into the <rs>Union</rs>, especially as the majority, within a brief period, could have amended the constitution according to their will and pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>If fraud existed in all or any of these proceedings, it was not for the <rs>President</rs>, but for Congress to investigate and determine the question of fraud, and what ought to be its consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It, at the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> elections, the majority refused to vote, it cannot be pretended that this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could invalidate an election fairly held under lawful authority, even if they had not subsequently voted at the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>It is true that the whole constitution had not been submitted to the people, as I always desired; but the precedents are numerous of the admission of States into the <rs>Union</rs> without such submission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It is sufficient to observe that their final action has removed the last vestige of serious revolutionary troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The desperate band recently assembled, under a notorious outlaw, in the southern portion of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, to resist the execution of the laws and to plunder peaceful citizens, will, I doubt not, be speedily subdued and brought to justice. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> Had I treated the <name>Lecompton</name> constitution as a nullity and refused to transmit it to Congress, it is not difficult to imagine, whilst recasting the position of the country at that moment, what would have been the disastrous consequences, both in and out of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, from such a dereliction of duty on the part of the <rs>Executive</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> Peace has also been restored within the <rs type="place">Territory of Utah</rs>, which, at the commencement of my administration, was in a state of open rebel on. This was the more dangerous, as the people, animated by a financial spirit, and entrenched within their distant mountain fastnesses, might have made a long and formidable resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Cost what it might, it was necessary to bring them into subjection to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Sound policy, therefore, as well as humanity, required that this object should, if possible, be accomplished without the effusion of blood.

Whilst the books of the <name>Treasury</name> show an actual expenditure of <measure n="59848474.72dollars" type="currency">$59,848,474.72</measure> for the year ending on the <date value="1860-06-30">30th June, 1860,</date> including <measure n="1010667.71dollars" type="currency">$1,010,667.71</measure> for the contingent expenses of Congress, there must be deducted from this amount the sum of <measure n="4296009.26dollars" type="currency">$4,296,009.26</measure>, with the interest upon of <measure n="150000dollars" type="currency">$150,000</measure>, appropriated by the act of <date value="1860-02-15">15th February, 1860,</date> &#x0022;for the purpose of supplying the deficiency in the revenues and defraying the expenses of the <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post Office Department</orgName> for the year ending the <date value="06-30">thirtieth of June,</date> <num value="1859">one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine</num>.&#x0022; This sum, therefore, justly chargeable to the year <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, must be deducted from the sum of <measure n="59848474.72dollars" type="currency">$59,848,474.72</measure>, in order to ascertain the expenditure for the year ending on the <date value="1860-06-30">30th June, 1860,</date> which leaves a balance for the expenditures of that year of <measure n="55402465.46dollars" type="currency">$55,402,465.46</measure>. The interest on the public debt, including Treasury notes for the same fiscal year ending on the <date value="1860-06-30">30th June, 1860,</date> amounted to <measure n="3177314.62dollars" type="currency">$3,177,314.62</measure>, which, added to the above sum of <measure n="55402465.16dollars" type="currency">$55,402,465.16</measure>, makes the aggregate of <measure n="58579780dollars" type="currency">$58,579,780</measure>.<unclear></unclear> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> It ought in justice to be observed that several of the estimates from the departments for the year ending <date value="1860-06-30">30th June, 1860,</date> were reduced by Congress below what was and still is deemed compatible with the public interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Allowing a liberal margin of <measure n="9500000dollars" type="currency">$9,500,000</measure> for this reduction, and for other causes, it may be safely asserted that the sum of <measure n="61000000dollars" type="currency">$61,000,000</measure>, or at the most <measure n="62000000dollars" type="currency">$62,000,000</measure>, is amply sufficient to administer the <rs>Government</rs> and to pay the interest on the public debt, unless contingent events should hereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> This result has been attained in a considerable degree by the care exercised by the appropriate departments in entering into public contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>I have myself never interfered with the award of any such contract except in a single case with the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName>, deeming it advisable to cost the whole responsibility in each case on the proper head of the department, with the general instruction that their contracts should always be given to the lowest and best bidder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It has ever been my opinion that public contracts are not a legitimate source of patronage to be conferred up. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s Message was sent in to Congress yesterday, at <time value="12pm">noon</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The Message proceeds at once to the consideration of the present crisis in the affairs of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Neither the efforts of Northern States to exclude slavery from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, nor to prevent the execution of the fugitive slave law, have contributed to bring it about, so much as the incessant and violent agitation of the question of slavery at the <rs>North</rs>, which has, at length, produced its malign influence on the slaves, and deprived the <rs>Southern</rs> home of that sense of security so essential to family happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>He does not think, however, that this evil will be increased by the election of a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> <rs type="role2">President</rs>, who is so wisely limited in his power by the <rs>Constitution</rs> that he has but little power for good or evil.--In view of this and the additional fact that the election was a constitutional <num value="1">one</num>, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> election is not regarded as cause in itself for dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The South, too, has Congress <unclear> </unclear>, and the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>As to the nullification laws of the <rs>Northern Legislatures</rs>, unless they are repeated, and without unnecessary delay, &#x0022;it is impossible for any human power to save the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022; If it is not done, the <rs>Constitution</rs> is violated, and the <rs>South</rs> &#x0022;would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the <rs>Government</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> While the <rs>President</rs> acknowledges this right of the <rs>South</rs> to resist wrong by revolution, he utterly opposes the doctrine of secession.--A revolution may be resistance to an actual aggression; but while secession is in effect a revolution, yet it may be unjustifiable, and not the revolting of a people urged on by their wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The Constitution never contemplated that any of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> should &#x0022;secede&#x0022; when they thought proper, and the <rs>President</rs> goes into a long legal argument to prove this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>In the case of revolution, every slight grievance should not be considered a sufficient cause &mdash; it should be a very great grievance &mdash; the last remedy of a desperate people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The blessings of such a government as ours should not be lightly thrown away. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>We wait with interest, in the general &#x0022;wreck of matter and crush of worlds&#x0022; which seems to be at hand, to see <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> demonstrate her anti slavery faith by her works, and give up, for the benefit of her noble ally, <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the carrying and manufacture of slave grown productions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>If she is at all tardy in this course of manifest consistency, the <rs>South</rs> ought, as far as possible, to spur up her benevolent impulses by taking temptation out of her way, and making some other nation our commercial ally. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> At the same time, it is but just to say that Old England derives most of her anti-slavery ideas from <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and her notions of Southern character from just such representations as those of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>.

<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Tariff.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/> It is now quite evident that the financial necessities of the <rs>Government</rs> will require a modification of the tariff during your present session, for the purpose of increasing the revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>In this aspect, I desire to reiterate the recommendation contained in my last <num value="2">two</num> annual messages, in favor of imposing specific instead of <hi rend="italics">ad<unclear></unclear></hi> duties on all imported articles to which these can be properly applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>From long observation and experience I am convinced that specific duties are necessary, both to protect the revenue and to secure to our manufacturing interests that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably results from a revenue tariff. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/> As an abstract proposition it may be admitted that <hi rend="italics">ad<unclear></unclear></hi> duties would, in theory, be the most just and equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>But if the experience of this and of all other commercial nations has demonstrated that such duties cannot be assessed and collected without great frauds upon the revenue, then it is the part of wisdom to resort to specific duties.--Indeed, from the very nature of an <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> duty, this must be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>Under it the inevitable consequence is that foreign goods will be entered at less than their true value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>The treasury will, therefore, lose the duty on the difference between their real and fictitious value, and to this extent we are defrauded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/> The temptations which <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> duties present to a dishonest importer are irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>His object is to pass his goods through the custom-house at the very lowest valuation necessary to save them from confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>In this he too often succeeds in spite of the vigilance of the revenue officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>Hence the resort to false invoices, <num value="1">one</num> for the purchaser and another for the custom-house, and to other expedients to defraud the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>The honest importer produces his invoice to the collector, stating the actual price at which he purchased the articles abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>Not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign manufacturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>And here it may be observed that a very large proportion of the manufactures imported from abroad are consigned for sale to commission merchants who are mere agents employed by the manufacturers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>In such cases no actual sale has been made to fix their value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>The foreign manufacturer, if he be dishonest, prepares an invoice of the goods, not at their actual value, but at the very lowest rate necessary to escape detection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>In this manner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest merchant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>They are thus enabled to undersell the fair trader, and drive him from the market.--In fact, the operation of this system has already driven from the pursuits of honorable commerce many of that case of regular and conscientious merchants, whose character, throughout the would is the pride of our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/> The remedy for these evils is to be found in specific duties, so far as this may be practicable.--They dispense with any inquiry at the custom-house into the actual coat or value of the article, and it pays the precise amount of duty previously fined by law. They present no temptations to the appraisers different goods, who receive but small salaries, and might, by undervaluation in a few cases render themselves independent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/> Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisition in the <rs>Constitution</rs> that &#x0022;no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of <num value="1">one</num> State over those of another.&#x0022; Under our <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> system such preferences are to some extent inevitable, and complaints have often been made that the spirit of this provision has been violated by a lower appraisement of the same articles at <num value="1">one</num> port than at another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/> An impression strangely enough prevails to some extent that specific duties are necessarily protective duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>Nothing can be more fallacious--<placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at the present moment collected under a system on specific duties.--It is a striking fact in this connection that in the commercial treaty of <date value="1860-01-23">23d January, 1860,</date> between <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the articles provides that the <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> duties which it imposes shall be converted into specific duties within <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> from its date, and these are to be ascertained by making an average of the prices for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> previous to that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>The reverse of the proposition would be nearer to the truth, because a much larger amount of revenue would be collected by merely converting the <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> duties of a tariff into equivalent specific duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>To this extent the revenue would be increased, and in the same proportion the specific duty might be diminished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/> Specific duties would secure to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> manufacturer the incidental protection to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to this surely no person would object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>The framers of the existing tariff have gone further, and in a liberal spirit have discriminated in favor of large and useful branches of our manufactures, not by raising the rate of duty upon the importation of similar articles from <unclear></unclear>, but what is the same in effect, by admitting articles free of duty which enter into the composition of their fabrics. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/> Under the present system it has been often truly remarked that this incidental protection decreases when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases when he needs it least, and constitutes a sliding scale which always operates against him. The revenues of the country are subject to similar fluctuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>Instead of approaching a stead, standard, as would be the case under a system of specific duties, they sink and free with the sinking and rising prices of articles in foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>It would not be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which would afford additional stability both to our revenue and our manufactures, and without injury or injustice to any interest of the country.
