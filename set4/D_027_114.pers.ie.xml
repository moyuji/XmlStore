<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>This is an annual custom of that people, heretofore celebrated with devout oblations to themselves of pumpkin pie and roast turkey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We have nothing to say against the custom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> becoming a better people, and which even they have great reasons for observing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>If any body on the earth has reason to be thankful that the rain falls on the unjust as well as the just, it is the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> At this time they have special grounds for thanksgiving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The formula of the <name>Pharisee</name>, always adapted to their national self-esteem, has been demonstrated in this war after a fashion which must carry conviction to the most incredulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It is a formula, more-over, in which even those can join who have not the privilege of being <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">I thank thee that I am not as other men.</hi>&#x0022; The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> may say that with a grateful heart, and other men can never be thankful enough that it is literally true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>So let us all have a day of thanksgiving, and the national airs of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle and Dixie for once be blended in honor of the same delightful beatitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> That the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is not as other men, he proved by drawing the sword upon the old customers whose trade had made him rich, and laboring with all his might and main to cut open the goose that laid him the golden egg. What &#x0022;other men&#x0022; would have hit upon so ingenious an expedient for improving their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>In <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, their nation was free from debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> who does not rejoice that these fellows are out of the way, and that he is eating their share as well as his own, must be lost to all the finer feelings of his race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> It is much to be thankful for that they have such a President as <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>What other men on the habitable globe would have chosen an ignorant and vulgar backwoods pettifogger for their <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>; or, having incurred the loss of the richest portion of their territory, more than a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, and <num value="2">two</num> billions of money, in penalty of their folly, would have worked for his re-election with every energy of soul and body?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>What other men would expect anything else from another <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> experiment but a double amount of debt and dead men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>What other men would find occasion for thanksgiving in such a past and such a future?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> knows what he is about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The money of the <rs>Government</rs> goes into his own pocket; and the fewer to eat, the more to be eaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> What &#x0022;other men&#x0022; would have carried on a war in the spirit and manner in which the pious and exemplary Sons of the <name>Pilgrims</name> have conducted this contest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of dwelling-houses burned and their once happy and unoffending inmates turned out to face, as best they may, cold and starvation; <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> barns and mills, with all their contents, given to the flames; whole cities depopulated; other cities made the target of a storm of bomb-shells, bursting among helpless, shrieking women and children; vast and once lovely regions of country laid black and bare by the fiery besom of desolation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Surely no &#x0022;other men&#x0022; but <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> could perpetrate, in the eves of the world, deeds like these; and no other men, in any age, would thank the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Christianity for the achievements of devils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Let us rejoice with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> that &#x0022;he is not as other men.&#x0022; Better to be the victim than the perpetrator of crimes against <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Humanity. </p> </div3>

The fire was returned and several soldiers were killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The exhibition was unnecessary; it contributed nothing to the success of the army, and the blood shed was causelessly and unnecessarily thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> regretted that incident to the last day of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>He spoke of it at St. Helena as having been a subject of unceasing remorse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>He had sacrificed to the love of childish display &mdash; the vanity of &#x0022;showing off&#x0022; before the ladies &mdash; the lives of several poor fellows when he knew there was no earthly necessity for it. In his defence, his extreme, youth considering the importance of the command, and the desire natural to all men, of his age to make a favorable impression upon &#x0022;the ladies,&#x0022; may be pleaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Probably few men in his situation would have done otherwise than he did.--But still it was a crime &mdash; a crime which brought with it a degree of remorse not accorded to all the bloodshed of his subsequent career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>His friendly biographers always speak of it with regret; those who are not friendly (the <rs>English</rs> for instance), speak of it as a crime of the deepest and blackest dye. The condemnation, considering the circumstances, is much too severe; but to the honor of mankind, no writer has ever yet been found to justify, though many have attempted to extenuate, the cruelty of the deed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The city of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is, in part, commanded by these guns, and the shot from them must necessarily fall in the midst of its population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It must be a miracle, if life, to some extent, be not lost by every <num value="1">one</num> of these shotted salutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They do no good, they advance no interest, they are not expected to further the operations of the slege in the slightest degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>If the design be to encourage the troops by a loud noise and an imposing demonstration, it would have the same effect to fire the guns without shot as with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The presumption is, therefore, that they are loaded with shot for the purpose of killing somebody; in other words, of perpetrating a cold-blooded murder, or, it may be, a dozen such, without expecting the slightest advantage from it. The friends of humanity in every part of the world except Christendom must regard such a deed with horror, and its perpetrator as an assassin. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> In Yankeedom, however, it is looked upon in a far different light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> voice has been raised against the inhuman barbarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Even in their rejoicing, these people are not satisfied without committing murder.
