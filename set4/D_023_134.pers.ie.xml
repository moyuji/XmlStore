<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> I have favored the project for connecting the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName>, to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is being extended across the <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russian Empire</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> The <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with unimportant exceptions, have remained undisturbed by the civil war, and they are exhibiting such evidences of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States, and be constitutionally admitted into the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the <rs>Government</rs>, and diminish the burdens of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective, is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories, with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries &mdash; results which cannot fall to be auspicious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue without injury to business, and with the least possible burdens upon labor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> The suspension of specie payments by the banks, soon after the commencement of your last session, made large issues of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> notes unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>In no other way could the payment of the troops, and the satisfaction of other just demands, be so economically or so well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially, at least, and for the time, the long felt want of an uniform circulating medium saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned, should ever be kept in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce the fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility, into coin is generally ac- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> knowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> notes payable in coin, and sufficiently large for the wants of the people, can be permanently, usefully, and safely maintained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made, and the great advantage of a safe and uniform currency secured? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> I know of none which promises so certain results and is, at the same time, so unobjectionable, as the organization of banking associations, under general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>To such associations the <rs>Government</rs> might furnish circulating notes, on the security of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> bonds deposited in the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the preparation and distribution of the notes, and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved, and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all existing interests, by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> The receipts into the <name>Treasury</name> from all sources, including loans and balance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending <date value="1862-06-30">on the 30th June, 1862,</date> were <measure n="583885217.06dollars" type="currency">$583,885,217.06</measure>, of which sum <measure n="19056397.62dollars" type="currency">$19,056,397.62</measure> were derived from customs; <measure n="1795331.73dollars" type="currency">$1,795,331.73</measure> from the direct tax; from public lands, <measure n="152203.77dollars" type="currency">$152,203.77</measure>; from miscellaneous sources, <measure n="931787.64dollars" type="currency">$931,787.64</measure>; from loans in all forms, <measure n="529692460.50dollars" type="currency">$529,692,460.50</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> Other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, to whose statements and views I invite your most candid and considerate attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The reports of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretaries of War</rs> and of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> are herewith transmitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Nor could I give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post Office Department</orgName> as compared with several preceding year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The receipts for the fiscal year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> amounted to <measure n="8349296.40dollars" type="currency">$8,349,296.40</measure>, which embraced the revenue from all the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs> for <num value="3">three</num> quarters for that year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of <measure n="8299820.90dollars" type="currency">$8,299,820.90</measure>, being only <measure n="50000dollars" type="currency">$50,000</measure> less than was derived from all the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs> during the previous year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The expenditures show a still more favorable result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The amount expended in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was <measure n="13606759.11dollars" type="currency">$13,606,759.11</measure>. For the last year the amount has been reduced to <measure n="11125364.43dollars" type="currency">$11,125,364.43</measure>, showing a decrease of about <measure n="2481000dollars" type="currency">$2,481,000</measure> in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about <measure n="3750000dollars" type="currency">$3,750,000</measure> as compared with the fiscal year <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The deficiency in the department for the previous year was <measure n="4551966.98dollars" type="currency">$4,551,966.98</measure>. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to <measure n="2142814.57dollars" type="currency">$2,142,814.57</measure> --These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States, and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed has also been much improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs> has also opened a correspondence through the <orgName n="State Department" type="department">Department of State</orgName>, with foreign Governments, proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens, and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained, and agreed to, by all the <name>Governments</name> from whom replies have been received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster General</rs> in his report respecting the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Interior">Secretary of the Interior</rs> reports as follows in regard to the public lands: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> &#x0022;The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>From the <dateStruct value="1861-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1862-09-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were <measure n="137476.26dollars" type="currency">$137,476.26</measure>--a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the same period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The Homestead law, which will take effect <date value="01-01">on the 1st of January</date> next, offers such inducements to settlers that sales of cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the <orgName n="General Land Office" type="office">General Land Office</orgName> and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Secretary"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands, and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName>, arises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not really, coincident at the beginning point &mdash; the <name>Treasury</name> report including a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the <name>Interior</name> &mdash; sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> now reported upon by the <name>Interior</name>, and not by the <name>Treasury</name>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and, at several points, have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>This attack was wholly unexpected, and, therefore, no means of defence had been provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>It is estimated that not less than <num value="800">eight hundred</num> persons were killed by the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, and a large amount of property was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not be stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Information was received by the <orgName n="Indian Bureau" type="bureau">Indian Bureau</orgName>, from different sources, about the time hostilities were commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes between the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName> and the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> It the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion, as a remedy for the differences between the people of the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> &#x0022;<num value="1">One</num> section of our country believes slavery is <hi rend="italics">right,</hi> and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is <hi rend="italics">wrong,</hi> and ought not to be extended &mdash; This is the only substantial dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The fugitive slave clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the law itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>This, I think cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases <hi rend="italics">after</hi> he separation of the sections than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in <num value="1">one</num> section; while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> <q>&#x0022;Physically speaking we cannot separate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>They cannot but remain face to face &mdash; an intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Is it impossible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous, or more satisfactory <hi rend="italics">after</hi> separation than <hi rend="italics">before?</hi> Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.&#x0022;</q> </p> </q><bibl n=""></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary, upon which to divide Trace through, from East to West, upon the line between the free and slave country and we shall and a little more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed and populated, or soon to be populated thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass, by writing it down on paper or parchment, as a national boundary.--The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up, on the part of the seceding section, the fugitive slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> But there is another difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The great interior region, bounded east by <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghenies</placeName>, north by the <rs>British</rs> dominions, west by the <rs type="place">Rocky mountains</rs>, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, part of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, all of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs>, <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName>, and the <rs>Territories</rs> of Dakotah, Nebraska, and part of <placeName reg="Colorado" key="tgn,7007158">Colorado</placeName>, already has above <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of people, and will have <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> within <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, if not prevented by any political folly or mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It contains more than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the country owned by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--certainly more than one million of square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Once half as populous as <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> already is, it would have more than <num value="75000000">seventy-five millions</num> of people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>A glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great body of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The other parts are but marginal borders to it, the magnificent region sloping west from the <rs type="place">Rocky mountains</rs> to the <rs>Pacific</rs> being the deepest, and also the richest, in undeveloped resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>In the production of provisions, grains grasses and all which proceed from them, this great interior region is naturally <num value="1">one</num> of the most important in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>And yet this region has no seacoast &mdash; touches no ocean anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>As part of <num value="1">one</num> nation, its people now find, and may forever find, their way to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by New York to <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName> and <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> by New Orleans, and to <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName> by <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>But separate our common country into <num value="2">two</num> nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some <num value="1">one</num> or more of these outlets; not, perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> And this is true, <hi rend="italics">wherever</hi> a dividing or boundary line may be fixed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Place it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, or north of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, and still the truth remains, that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a Government foreign to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>These outlets, <name>east</name>, <name>west</name>, and <name>south</name>, are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast interior region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/><hi rend="italics">Which</hi> of the <num value="3">three</num> may be best is no proper question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>All are better than either; and all, of right, belong to that people and to their successors forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>True to themselves, they will not ask <hi rend="italics">where</hi> a line of separation shall be, but will vow, rather, that there shall be no such line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to, and through them, to the great <sic>ouside</sic> world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>They, too, and each of them, must have access to this <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> of the <rs>West</rs>, without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> Our national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the land we inhabit; not from our national homestead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>There is no possible severing of this, but would multiply, and not mitigate evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union, and abhors separation in fact, it would ere long, force re-union, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> Our strife pertains to ourselves &mdash; to the passing generations of men; and it can, without convulsion, be hushed forever with the passing of <num value="1">one</num> generation. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Without slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it could not continue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> Among the friends of the <rs>Union</rs> there is great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> race amongst us Some would perpetuate slavery; some would abolish it suddenly, and without compensation; some would abolish it gradually and with compensation; some would remove the free people from among us, and some would retain them with us, and there are yet other minor diversities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Because of these diversities we <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> waste much strength in struggles among ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>By mutual concession we should harmonize an act together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>This would be compromise, but it would be compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>These articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> As to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article, the main points are: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the emancipation; secondly, the length of time for consummating it--<measure n="37years" type="date">thirty-seven years</measure>; and, thirdly, the compensation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery; but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangement &mdash; in fact, from the necessity of derangement &mdash; while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before its consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They will never see it. Another class will nail the prospect of emancipation but will deprecate the length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>They will feel that it gives too little to the now living slaves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> But it really gives them much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great; and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time, or by degrees, extending over the whole or any part of the period, and obliges no <num value="2">two</num> States to precede alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It also provides for compensation and generally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Doubt less, some of those who are to pay, and not to receive, will object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Yet the measure is both just and economical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>In a certain sense, the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property &mdash; property acquired by descent, or by purchase the same as any other property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It is no less true for having been often said, that the people of the <rs>South</rs> are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than are the people of the <rs>North</rs> and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the <rs>South</rs> has been more responsible than the <rs>North</rs> for its continuance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>If, then, for a common object, this property is to be sacrificed is it not just it be done at a common charge? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> And if, with less money, or money more easily paid we can preserve the benefits of the <rs>Union</rs> by this means than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Let us considered, then Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed last <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and consider whether if that measure had been promptly accepted, by even some of the slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>If so, the measure would save money and in that view, would be a prudent and economical measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Certainly, it is not so easy to pay <hi rend="italics">something</hi> as it is to pay <hi rend="italics">nothing;</hi> but it is easier to pay a <hi rend="italics">large </hi> than it is to pay a <hi rend="italics">larger</hi> <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>And it is easier to pay any sum <hi rend="italics">when</hi> we are able than it is to pay it <hi rend="italics">before</hi> we are able.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The war requires large sums and requires them at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course, would be large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds even, any <unclear></unclear> than the emancipation progresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>This might not and probably would not close before the end of the <measure n="37years" type="date">thirty seven years</measure>. At that time we shall probably have a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of people to share the burden, instead of <num value="31000000">thirty-one millions</num>, as now. And not only so but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before; because our territory will not have become full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>I do not state this inconsiderately. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> national census, in <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>, until that of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> we should in <dateStruct value="1900--"><year reg="1900">1900</year></dateStruct> have a population of <num value="103208415">103,208,415</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Our abundant room &mdash; our broad national homestead &mdash; is our ample resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Were our territory as limited as are the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896">British Isles</placeName>, very certainly our population could not expand as stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Instead of receiving the foreign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native born away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>But such is not our condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>We have <num value="2000000">two millions</num> <num value="963000">nine hundred and sixty-three thousand</num> square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Why may not our country, at some time, average as Any?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Is it less fertile?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Has it more waste surface, by mountains rivers, lakes, deserts, or other <unclear>can </unclear> Is it inferior to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in any natural advantage?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>If then, we are at some time to be as populous as <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, how soon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>As to when this <unclear></unclear> be, we can judge by the past and the present as to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due; but it shows the great importance of time in this connection the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> what, by a different policy we would have to pay now, when we number but <num value="31000000">thirty-one millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war, than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It will be a saving of both. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> As to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners; and hence, provision is made in this article for compensating such. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> article relates to the future of the freed people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>It does not oblige but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>This ought not to be regarded as objectionable, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand or on the other, in so much as it comes to nothing, unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> voters, through their representatives in Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> I cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor colonization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>If there ever could be a proper time for more catch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Is it true, then, that colored persons can displace any more white labor by being free, than by remaining slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>If they stay in their places, they jostle no white laborers if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Logically, there is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed; the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> and very probably, for a time would do less leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand and consequently, enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Labor is live any other commodity in the market &mdash; increase the demand for it, and your increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor, by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and, by precisely so much you increase the demand for, and wages of, white labor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> But it is dreaded that the people will swarm forth and cover the whole land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Are they not already in the land?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Will liberation make them any more numerous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Equally distributed among the whites of the whole country, and there would be <num value="1">one</num> colored to <num value="7">seven</num> whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Could the <num value="1">one</num> in any way greatly disturb the <num value="7">seven</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>There are many communities now having more than <num value="1">one</num> free colored person to <num value="7">seven</num> whites, and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> and the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> are all in this condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The District has more than <num value="1">one</num> free colored to <num value="6">six</num> white; and yet, in its frequent petitions to Congress, I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as <num value="1">one</num> of its grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>But why should emancipate on <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName> send the freed people North?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>People of any color seldom run, unless there be something to run from <hi rend="italics">Heretofore</hi> colored people, to some extent, have fled North from bondage; and <hi rend="italics">now</hi> perhaps, from both bondage and destitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>But if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured; and the freed men in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them, in congenial climes, and with people of their own blood and rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>And in any event, cannot the <rs>North</rs> decide for itself whether to receive them? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> Again as practice proves more than theory, in any case, has there been any irruption of colored people northward, because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last spring? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the <rs>District</rs>, is from the census of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> having no reference to persons called contrabands, nor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery here. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> Nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of <date value="1862-09-02">September 2d, 1862</date> he stayed because of the <hi rend="italics">recommendation</hi> of his plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Its timely <hi rend="italics">adoption,</hi> <unclear></unclear> would bring restoration, and hereby stay both. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation, before this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> This plan is recommended as a means not in exclusion of, but additional to all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The plan would I am confident secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently, than can be done by force alone, while aid would cost considering accounts and <unclear></unclear> payment and times or payment would be <unclear> </unclear> paid than will be the additional cost of <unclear></unclear> if we rely society <unclear></unclear> force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It is much very much that it would cost to place at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become such without the concurrence of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of Congress and afterwards <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The requisite <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <name>States</name> will necessarily include <num value="7">seven</num> of the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>This assurance would end the struggle now, and save the <rs>Union</rs> forever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the <rs>Congress</rs> of the nation by the <unclear></unclear> <rs type="role" reg="Magistrate">Magistrate</rs> of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors; nor that many of you have more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen the expenditure of money and of blood?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Is it doubted that we here &mdash; Congress and Executive &mdash; can secure its adoptions &mdash; Will not the good, people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Can we, can they, by any other means, so certainly, or speedily, assure these vital objects?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>We can succeed only by concert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It is not <q>&#x0022;can <hi rend="italics">any</hi> of us <hi rend="italics">imagine</hi> better?&#x0022;</q> but, <q>&#x0022;can we <hi rend="italics">all</hi> do better?&#x0022;</q> The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.--The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>As our case is now, so we must think anew and act anew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> Fellow citizens <hi rend="italics">we</hi> cannot escape history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>We of this Congress and this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>No personal significance, or insignificance can spare <num value="1">one</num> or an other of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>We <hi rend="italics">say</hi> we are for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The world will not forget that we say this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>We know how to save the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The world knows we do know how to save it. We &mdash; even <hi rend="italics">we here</hi> --hold the power and bear the responsibility.
