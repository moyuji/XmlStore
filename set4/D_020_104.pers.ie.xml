<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> &#x0022;I have never believed in the doctrine of Purgatory, and have all my life fought against it; among other reasons, I have declared that in the whole grand sweep of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> moral government, I could find no place to locate it; and, if a place could be found, I saw no necessity for it, with the full provisions for redemption made in the <rs>Redeemer Christ</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Such are that class of <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> who would still wish to remain neutral, when our State has been invaded by a marauding soldiery from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> --A correspondent in a late number of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> expresses the opinion that the medical men of the army are unjustly held responsible for sickness and neglect which are often the fault of other departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The unhealthy location of a camp, mismanagement in the <rs>Commissary</rs>'s and <rs type="role2">Quartermaster</rs>'s departments, it is urged, may have caused many of the grievances of which the public complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The long and continued inaction of the troops, resting out the very marrow of their life, has also exerted its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We dare say that the doctors, as our correspondent alleges, are not the only ones who should be held responsible for the sufferings of our men during the last summer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Nor do we doubt that there are many good physicians in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We know some of them personally, and are acquainted by reputation with others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They are gentlemen of eminent skill, of conscientiousness, and fidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They are as incapable of receiving the liberal compensation which surgeons receive, (<measure n="2400dollars" type="currency">$2,400</measure> per annum,) and neglecting their duty, as they are of highway robbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We have no complaint to make of such men. We respect their noble profession, and we think none the less of it, that all but the quacks in that profession have come to the conclusion that the less medicine you give a patient the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But we hear that there are not a few incompetent surgeons in the army, and that in all probability they are producing a fatality greater than could be effected by the combined powers of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>, <persName n="Rosencranz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Rosencranz,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosencranz</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is believed that all the balls thrown by the ships in the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and the batteries on the shore, have not done as much damage to the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> as the boluses of some of these doctors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We understand that a distinguished physician expresses the opinion that the army would be better off without doctors altogether, because the good ones cannot do as much good as the incompetent do harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Our attention has also been called to another fact which demands attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is that if surgeons are able to pursue their private practice, half the present salary of <measure n="2400dollars" type="currency">$2,400</measure> would be compensation enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If a patient is able to be killed at <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> a month, a physician, who has other sources of income, ought to be willing to kill him at a <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The satisfaction of taking a man off <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">secundum artem </hi></foreign> would be an ample compensation for any deficiency of pecuniary emolument. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The salaries of chaplains in the army-have been reduced to <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure>. --The cure of souls is as important as the cure of bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Let this wrong be redressed, and the pay of chaplains be made at least half as much as that of surgeons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We ought to have good chaplains in the army, educated, pious, philosophical men, who can sweeten by their words of wisdom and consolation the bitterest pill that the private has to take. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I sat in his office for <num value="1">one</num> hour, and observed him in the midst of business, giving his ear and attention to a multitude of details and an infinite variety of applications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>No man I have met has impressed me more favorably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He is polite and intelligent,-- --comprehends readily the questions submitted to him, and disposes of them with facility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Simple and unaffected in his manners, he is wholly free from that grave and mysterious air of consequence, with which men devoid of merit seek to impose upon the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I would trust my fortune to his good sense and discretion in any emergency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> If there is <num value="1">one</num> error more than any other into which our military leaders have fallen, it is the mistaken and contemptible idea that an abrupt manner and a curt reply are the evidences of their fitness for power and authority. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi> Having a full knowledge of the destitute condition of the <rs>Hampton</rs> soldiers, I feel it to be my sacred duty to call the attention of a generous public to their situation, and I assure you that nothing gives me more pleasure than to do something for these patriotic and gallant soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Being a soldier myself I of course have not the means to supply their wants, and can only call upon those who have to do something in the noble cause of aiding these destitute soldiers, who have left home and all its comforts and endearments to rescue the endangered and perishing liberties of their country.--But though unable to alleviate their sufferings, I trust I have that genuine sympathy for these suffering fellow- soldiers, which I hope pervades the breast of every gallant daughter and son within the limits of this renowned old Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Impelled by patriotism, they were among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to offer their services to this State though they knew, when taking this patriotic step, that they were depriving themselves of their homes and its comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>When they saw that it was the cruel intention of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> dynasty to invade the sacred soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and to wage a war of subjugation against the <rs>South</rs>, they eagerly rushed to the aid of their State, and the cry <q> &#x0022;to arms, to arms,&#x0022;</q> reverberated throughout the gallant county of <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth City</placeName> &mdash; from the very walls of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> to the borders of <placeName reg="York, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1003048">York county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Though neglected by their State, yet, when the order came for them to abandon their homes, and the graves of their departed kindred, to the merciless tread of a vandal horde, they obeyed the order without a murmur, leaving all that they possessed on earth to the mercy of a cruel and unscrupulous enemy.--And from the very moment that they were mustered into service up to the present time, they have been doing hard service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Day by day have they felled the mighty trees of the forest, and thrown up the earthworks to prevent the enemy from making a victorious march through the county and gaining possession of your hospitable city, which they seemed so desirous to occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Though their own little county was occupied by the enemy, yet still the cause of the <rs>South</rs> was their cause, and they hesitated not to sacrifice their all in its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I shall say nothing of the burning of the town, save that it received their warmest approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I will leave that to history, knowing that it will do them justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It is enough to say that they are needy and destitute, and I feel confident that their case will receive the warmest sympathy of the gallant people of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>He furthermore told the overseer that it would take a better or stronger man than he was to make him go in the barn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>He continued to use other insolent language to the overseer, and at the same time advanced upon him. Having his double-barrelled gun with him, loaded with bird shot, the overseer raised it to his shoulder and commanded the negro to stop; that if he advanced another step towards him he would shoot him. But the negro turned his side towards the overseer and quickened his pace upon him. The gun was fired, the whole load passing through the fleshy part of <num value="1">one</num> of the negro's arms, inflicting a painful wound, and it is thought cut the blood vessels of the arm. After he was shot, the negro turned his other side to the overseer, and cursing him, told him to shoot his other arm. The name of the overseer could not be learned; but immediately after he had shot the negro he went to a Magistrate of the county and gave himself up. Upon hearing his statement (substantially as above) he was released. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>As the bearer of this astounding intelligence could give no names, and her statement, in other respects, was not very explicit or circumstantial, the police, into whose hands the matter was given for investigation, could trace out nothing definite.
