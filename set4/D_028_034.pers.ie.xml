<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Instead of its being denied, however, it is confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><persName n="Lamar,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName> has not only taken the oath, but finds it very easy and agreeable to take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>All he has to do is to shut his eyes, open his mouth, and old <persName n="Longlegs,Father,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Longlegs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Father">Father</roleName> <surname>Longlegs</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName>, slips down in jelly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>With a little decoction of cotton seed to take out the taste, <persName n="Lamar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><surname>Lamar</surname></persName> finds it not bad thing to take, after all.

The venerable <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs>, having parted with his caudal appendage, is now perambulating the ramparts of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, exhibiting a cut of the latest fashion to the outside be holders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He invites them to follow his example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is believed that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,Tecumseh,,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> will now dispense with the landward guns on the fortifications of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and, instead thereof, display the butt end of <placeName reg="Lamar, Barton, Missouri" key="tgn,2059472">Lamar</placeName> to the admiration and imitation of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> A Southern contemporary, commenting on the conduct of <persName n="Lamar,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName>, exclaims; &#x0022; Oh, man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>man! what a humbug thou art!&#x0022; A most refreshing piece of plain talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But we say not that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We have a rustic confidingness in the genus homo which renders us reluctant to identify it with the genus humbug.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We fell inclined especially to put our trust in princes and politicians, in men of large property and great pretensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Your &#x0022;solid men,&#x0022; of course, cannot be hollow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It distresses us that this <persName n="Lamar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><surname>Lamar</surname></persName> should disturb our rustic faith and childlike simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Why, he is the man, is he not?--who tried to revive the <rs>Slave Trade</rs>, who was among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suitors of the nymph, Secessia, and took her to wife, for better, for worse, swearing &mdash; With all my worldly goods, ships and cotton bales, I do thee crow!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>And now upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation that she is dead, before the screws are well in her coffin, or the psalm sung at her funeral, he hurries off. to the apron strings of another woman, the <rs type="role" reg="IsChild">mother of</rs> the girl he ran away with, and takes an oath of eternal love and fidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Oh! thou gay deceiver!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>How can we ever believe in man again?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Who shall ever restore to us our lost faith in the fine gold of humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> It is evident that <persName n="Sherman,,Tecumseh,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Sherman,Tecumseh,,,"><foreName>Tecumseh</foreName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, in addition to his other accomplishments, is no mean professor in the so called science of animal magnetism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He proceeds to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, makes a few passes at his subjects, puts them <hi rend="italics">en rapport</hi> forthwith, so that they see what he sees, taste what he tastes, and even think what he thinks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He manipulates this <name>Lamar</name>, and makes him think that old woman, whose daughter he persuaded to cope, is a charming young virgin; that the blood upon the wrinkled face of the bag is the bloom of the rose, that the striped bunting of tyranny is a gorgeous bridal dress, glittering all over with real diamonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He puts into his mouth a bitter, nauseating oath, enough to turn the stomach of a swine, and <persName n="Lamar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><surname>Lamar</surname></persName> vows it is nectar, and invites his friends to step up and take a drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>And all this is affected by metallic attraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,Tecumseh,,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> only puts a little piece of gold in the subject's hand, and directs him to look fixedly at it, without permitting his attention to be distracted by anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is an infallible process, and anybody who submits to it is bound to dream dreams and see visions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> But when <persName n="Lamar,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName> awakes from his slumber he will make some discoveries which will not much promote his peace of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The nymph Secessia is not dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>On the contrary, she is rising <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> from her bed of pain and sadness with rejuvenated youth and beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The old woman he has sworn to love, honor and obey, will bring him only a dowry of sharp fangs, long nails and bitter curses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>She will not permit him long to enjoy the soft repose of his cotton mattress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>She will pull it out from under him, and kick him out from bed and board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He will have the taste of that oath in his mouth all his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He will realize, to his last hour, that keenest pang of such minds; &#x0022;The wicked have digged a pit and have fallen into the midst of it themselves.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> We need not invoke a grand rally at the assemblage to day. The immense popular enthusiasm will bring together such a concourse as has never been seen in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Not even the days of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> approached the blazing fires which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has just kindled afresh in every Confederate heart.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> A Richmond correspondent of a Southern paper says: &#x0022;<persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> told <persName n="Rives,Mister,W.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="default:Rives,W.,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName>, the other day, that there was but a single thing to fear, and that was the spreading of a causeless despondency among the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Prevent that, and all would be well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>We had strength enough left to win our independence, and we were certain to win it if the people will only not give way to a foolish despair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> &#x0022;To another distinguished gentleman, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> said that the attack of the press on the <rs>President</rs> pained him (<persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>) very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>He had confidence in the <rs>President</rs>, and did not think we could find a better man for that place.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> We have also heard, from another source, which we consider entitled to credit, that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> said he was &#x0022;surprised at the despondency of the citizens.&#x0022; When <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> speaks thus; when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> says <hi rend="italics">&#x0022;we have strength enough left to win our independence, and we are certain to win it if the people will only not give way to a foolish despair,&#x0022;</hi> the people ought to believe him. This is not the irresponsible utterance of an excited politician, and still less of a street corner oracle; it is the voice of the highest military authority in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; of a man better informed than any other of the resources of the enemy and of our own; it is spoken in the freedom of social intercourse, and not for public effect; and it comes from a man who never exaggerates, and who would not stain his honor by deception for all the renown the world could give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Do the people believe <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="default:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> The people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> know at last what the loss of their independence means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They have that knowledge from the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>, and from the lips of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.
