<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">yankees</rs> would have fairer prospect of accomplishing the little task of subjugation prescribed for themselves, if they could only reverse their programme, and talk small and do large, instead of talk large and do small. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But the coarse of cowardice or the demon of procrastination afflicts the fellow and his fellows, and he has done nothing yet. Week after week has passed, until hope of a fight deferred almost sickens the impatient spirits of our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The poor devils are discovering that it is no holiday sport to rough it on the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> coasts in winter, with no dry camping ground, no good water, and no chances of plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The bad water, the bad weather, and the lack of fresh grub, have made the hospital department the most important branch of the <q>&#x0022;Expedition of the <rs>Southwest</rs>.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We have enough and to spare at every point of importance, to hold it against any force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Since my last, a lively business has been done by the <q>&#x0022;blockade breakers,&#x0022;</q> with mixed success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I may not say how many vessels have successionally get out of port, nor may I say what have successfully got in, except such as the enemy know of as well as we. <num value="1">One</num> has been captured about <measure n="18miles" type="distance">18 miles</measure> from the mouth of the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>She left mobile and escaped to <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName> as the schooner <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Wilder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Wilder,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilder</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> the property of Confederate owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>She was there sold to a British subject, was re- christened the <q>&#x0022;Andrewetts,&#x0022;</q> and took out a clearance for <placeName reg="Matamoras, Blackford, Indiana" key="tgn,2496268">Matamoras</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Not happening to sail in that direction, how ever, she was <num value="1">one</num> morning discovered lying aground close into the shore of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> by the blockaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They sent boats to take possession; but, when they approached, were fired on by members of a Mobile <orgName n="Cavalry company" type="company">cavalry company</orgName>, the <q>&#x0022;City Troop,&#x0022;</q> lying in ambush on the shore, and were driven off with the loss of <num value="1">one</num> of their boats, and many killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Later in the day, they made another effort with all the boats and launches of <num value="2">two</num> large steamers, conveying between <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men. The Confederate troopers fought them until their ammunition was exhausted, when a hawser was carried out to a steamer and the schooner hauled off &mdash; a costly prize, for <num value="12">twelve</num> bodies of slain <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs> have since drifted ashore, and doubtless many drifted to sea, or were carried off by their comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The bodies were of those who jumped or fell overboard when shot, or were dead in the boat which was capsized in the confusion of the fight by the panic- stricken wretches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The schooner has been claimed by an agent of the <rs>British Consul</rs> here, under a flag of truce, but has been sent North by <persName n="McKeon,Flag-Officer,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:McKeon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Flag-Officer">Flag Officer</roleName> <surname>McKeon</surname></persName> for adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>You will find the points of the claim for rendition, or for subsequent indemnity, set forth at length in a late issue of the <hi rend="italics">Advertiser and Register,</hi> of this city, as I suppose that so desirable a journal is on your exchange list. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Another schooner, the <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Richards,,Jessie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Richards,Jessie,,,"><foreName>Jessie</foreName> <surname>Richards</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> loaded with cotton, grounded in running out of the harbor at night, and being in range of the blockaders next morning, was burned by her crew to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The crew escaped to shore in their boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The schooner <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Clara,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Clara,nomatch:0"><surname>Clara</surname></persName>&#x0022;</q> arrived safely from <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName> in this port a few days before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Another schooner, the <q>&#x0022;Leone,&#x0022; </q> accomplished no less a feat than running the blockade with a valuable cargo. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> A passenger by this schooner relates an incident of the perilous voyage from <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName>, which smacks considerably of the romance of the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>On the night before they approached the coast, when dark and ugly weather prevailed, a little stir was heard on deck which brought him up from the cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The schooner was rolling in the trough of the sea, with her sails shivering, and looming out of the darkness like a phantom ship, scarcely more than <num value="2">two</num> cables, lengths a way, was the great black bull of a Lincoln cruiser &mdash; a steamer &mdash; darting rapidly past, her guns grinning from her open ports, and men discernible on her deck by the light of the ship lanterns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The crew of the little schooner held their breath in suspense, and moved not until the danger was past, fearing that a whisper, or the creaking of her tackle, or the flapping of a sail, would betray her presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The precaution of having no light aboard, save that in the binnacle, alone, saved the schooner from being discovered by the watch of the steamer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> A splendid gun-boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>christened the <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,Daniel,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> as she touched the water, was launched day before yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>She was planned and constructed by <persName n="Bassett,Mister,H.,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Bassett,H.,D.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Bassett</surname></persName>, a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <rs type="role" reg="Naval Constructor">naval constructor</rs>, and all those who know anything about the merits of a vessel, say that if she does not establish his fame as a naval architect he will not have his deserts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Her lines are the perfection of all the points which are considered pre-requisites of speed and strengths and a more beautiful craft never floated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>if our present volunteers now draw back &mdash; if they lose that noble enthusiasm which prompted them at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to meet the enemy, without stopping to count the cost, whether of personal inconvenience or pecuniary loss, it would have been better if the contest had never been begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>We have gained nothing till we gain all we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took up arms for; nay, we lose all if we do not gain all. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> The dependence of the country for the next campaign upon the volunteers now in the field, rests upon <num value="2">two</num> principal grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is, that the present volunteers are the elite of the courage and manhood of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Let them now fall out of the ranks of the army, and where can their like be found in anything like the same numbers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I assure you, and I assure them, that their places cannot be supplied in any considerable degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> ground is, that the enemy, from necessity, must make an onward, movement, (if ever,) in the next <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>; it may be sooner, and, can any <num value="1">one</num> suppose if the present volunteers, or any considerable number of them, retire from the army, and their places have to be filled by raw militia, that we can successfully meet an enemy that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has been drilling and preparing for last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> with the most rigorous energy?

It is a structure that has been thrown up since the beginning of the war, a short distance within the <placeName reg="Tennessee, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> line, on the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It was designed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as a defence against marauding excursions of the enemy, and was never expected to resist a heavy bombardment, or assault from a large land force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>To have manned it with a very large force of our own, and to have armed it with a sufficient number, of heavy guns to enable it to be held under any assault, would have required too great a dissipation of our strength and extension of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The enemy has taken this fort, as be will take other points of importance on the line of navigable waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>His great strength in artillery and in boats give him the power to do so. These things we cannot well avoid; but when he marches against us on dry land, then is our opportunity, and then our occasion for punishing him properly. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The road without the bridge will still be available for strengthening our lines on either side of the river; <hi rend="italics">through</hi> connection, except for mere convenience, being a matter of inferior importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The world is interested in the trade of the <rs>South</rs> to the extent of its purchases from us and its sales to us. It is not only thus materially interested in the restoration of peace, to the extent of from <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num> of dollars per annum; but it is morally interested in suppressing the <num value="1001">thousand and one</num> evils that result to all Christendom from the wars of great nations; and it is politically interested in putting an early stop to a conflict which, as all conflicts do, endangers the peace of neutral nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> The nations of the earth constitute a great family and enjoy a community of interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>This is the case in fact, however obstinately some of them may deny the great truth and resist the consequences of it. The vices of <num value="1">one</num> nation indirectly affect the moral health of all others; and the material losses of <num value="2">two</num> belligerent powers are losses in which all nations must more or less participate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>These truths are recognized and inculcated by the law of nations, and that law, therefore, authorizes neutral powers, after a decent period of attainment from the quarrel, to interfere for the separation of combatants and the pacification of their disputes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The right of bystanders to separate the belligerents in a fracas between individuals, is recognized by all citizens; and it is on the same principle that nations interfere to settle the quarrel of hostile powers engaged in war. The recognition of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> as a distinct nationality of the earth by <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers, will be but the prelude to the further step of interfering for the pacification of <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>In this point of view, recognition is desired by the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; in any other point of view, not much of direct and immediate benefit is expected from it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> That the <rs>South</rs> is a power possessing all the elements of independence, is self-evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Considered with reference to the political structure of the late <rs>Federal Government</rs>, the <rs>South</rs> is legally and constitutionally independent.
