<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The receipt of this decidedly unequivocal order threw the police into a great state of confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The steamer was to start for <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, and it then only lacked <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> of the appointed time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The appearance of so many uniformed policemen at such a moment somewhat disturbed the equanimity of the captain; but, quickly recovering his presence of mind, he inquired what the intruders wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The police, who were breathless with excitement, could only articulate #x34;muskets,&#x0022; &#x0022;treason,&#x0022; &#x0022;contraband goods,&#x0022;and, without more ado, jumped into the hold and commenced searching for the munitions of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> By this time the captain began to understand what was in the wind, and, approaching the edge of the hatch way, held the following conversation with the police: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The idea of being carried to sea, and to a secession State, too, was rather repugnant to the feelings of the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>If the captain had threatened to blow them to atoms with grape and cannister they would not have been half so frightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Hastily emerging from the hold, they clambered upon the bulwarks, ready to jump ashore at a moment's warning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Their fears of any immediate danger were groundless, however, for the men on the pier were prevented from executing the order of the captain by a couple of the harbor police &mdash; so there was no danger of their being carried off in a hurry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The captain was not to be nonplussed so easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Finding that his orders could not be obeyed on shore, he directed the sailors to cut the lines on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The engineer then received orders to "start her ahead," and just as the vessel began to move off, the <name>Metropolitans</name> bethought of moving, too. The scene which ensued is described as ludicrous in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The brave policemen were wild with fright, and precipitated themselves over the side of the steamer in anything but an orderly or graceful manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The crowd on the pier cheered at the discomfiture of the police, and as the <rs>Montgomery</rs> glided out into the river, similar manifestations were observed on board among the officers and passengers. </p>
