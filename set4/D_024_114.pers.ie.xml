<head><rs n="Battle of the Wilderness" type="battle">Battle of the Wilderness</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We stated briefly a few days ago some moral and fanciful reasons why the great battle in which <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> fell should be called the <hi rend="smallcaps"><rs n="Battle of the Wilderness" type="battle">Battle of the Wilderness</rs>.</hi> The matter of fact, however, is stronger than anything else in behalf of the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The great battle was <hi rend="italics">really fought in the <rs>Wilderness</rs></hi>--a country of gravelly clay soil, and a black-jack growth, presenting in many places an almost impenetrable thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There were occasional small openings of cleared and cultivated fields, in which the enemy had his works for defence.--The position was <num value="1">one</num> of great strength and was very probably alluded to by <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> a short time since as <num value="1">one</num> he knew of, from which the whole <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> could not dislodge him. If he thought he knew such an <num value="1">one</num> he would certainly go to it, and no doubt did, in preference to all others accessible to him. It was indeed a strong <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Yet <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s impetuous charge in the very jaws of death, as it were, could not be resisted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and they were driven from it. The name &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,7017622" n="1.000 715" reg="wilderness, spotsylvania, virginia">Wilderness</placeName>&#x0022; will perpetuate the nature of the position thus heroically stormed and carried &mdash; it will commemorate the last great fight of that Hero of many bloody fields whose last achievement was his greatest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> On the other hand, &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>&#x0022; is the name of a place with only <num value="1">one</num> dwelling-house situated several miles from the great fight of the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> combat; and unsuggestive as it is at best, it could not therefore be applied with topographical truthfulness to designate the bloody struggle with the ruthless invader. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The debate in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="--23"><day reg="2">23d</day></dateStruct>, upon the <hi rend="italics">pass</hi> given by <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Adams,Privates,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> to an English ship to a <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> port, displays the existence of much feeling on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><persName n="Rosbuck,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Rosbuck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rosbuck</surname></persName>, a converted Radical, formerly our enemy, now our friend, leaped boldly into the ring and called out for justice to the &#x0022;dignity&#x0022; and &#x0022;honor&#x0022; of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and for the protection of her commerce from the &#x0022;sneering insolence of an <hi rend="italics">upstart race!</hi>&#x0022;--He was lustily cheered by the <name>Opposition</name>.--He declared that if the demand for this justice and this protection of the commerce of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> led to war the <rs>English</rs> people were prepared for it. No other member went so far in a bellicose demonstration; but the act of <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=43">Adams, U. S.</placeName> Minister, was severely censured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> While these outgiving are interesting, as displaying the sentiment of the <rs>British</rs> people through their representatives, the main point is as to the reply of <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, in the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>, and the course of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <rs>Earl</rs> declared <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Adams,Privates,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>'s conduct &#x0022;most unwarrantable.&#x0022; The Government, he stated, had declined to hold communication with him on the subject, but would forward a statement of the case to the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs> on the <date value="04-25">25th of April.</date> This thrusting of <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Adams,Privates,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> aside, in order to present the matter directly to his Government, is a happy proceeding for the <rs>Lincoln Cabinet</rs>, and suggests to them a means of composing the difficulty which they will most assuredly avail themselves of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The reply of <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> being general, we are not informed as to the exact nature of the communication to the <rs>Washington Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>His mild language about it as &#x0022;a representation of the facts,&#x0022; would suggest the inference that it was not very <hi rend="italics">sharp;</hi> that it was hardly up to the example of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> itself, when it not only demanded that the <rs>British Government</rs> should disapprove <persName n="Crampton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Crampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crampton</surname></persName>'s (British Minister to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>) agency in the matter of enlisting troops in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the <name>Crimean</name> war, but that it should withdraw <persName n="Crampton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Crampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crampton</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><num value="1">One</num> would think that the opportunity being good <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> would seize it to retort this practice precisely upon <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Possibly he may have done so; but <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s statement does not encourage the belief that he has. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The British Cabinet is evidently afraid of <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>; it will do anything to avoid a difficulty with him. It refuses to recognize the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It will most scrupulously preserve that centrality which is throwing every facility in the hands of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and putting the most inconvenient and serious obstacles in our way. It will strictly observe all the most extravagant conceptions of its obligations to the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>, while that Government is abundantly supplying itself not only with every munition of war to fight us, but is, against right and law, making enlistments in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> upon appeals to the prejudices and hatred of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in the minds of the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, which prejudices and hatred are propitiated by promises of aid to free <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> from <name>British</name> dominion as soon as the <rs>South</rs> is conquered!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>To preserve her centrality and avoid hostilities with such a power <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is shaping her policy with a spirit of conciliation and caution altogether inconsistent with a proper sense of dignity and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Members of Parliament are urged to be cautions &mdash; to weigh their words &mdash; not to make too many inquiries about British and <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> relations &mdash; and not to say anything offensive and calculated to wound the sensibilities of a people whom <num value="1">one</num> of them has the boldness to call an &#x0022;upstart race.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> It gives us no pleasure to look at <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We generally turn away when they approach, and look at something more agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time yesterday we scanned critically the faces of these creatures, not in a spirit of insult, but to observe what manner of men they are. For the most part the arrivals yesterday were well clothed, had good shoes, and appeared to be well fed. Many of them were young, but the great mass large and able-bodied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Their faces, however, were very different from the open, earnest, elevated faces of our men. The expression was sensual, selfish, secretive, which are the prevalent characteristics of their race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In these respects the officers are as had as the men. Some of the officers who were brought prisoners from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 7" reg="africa">Guinea</placeName>'s a week ago looked with licentious leers upon the ladies who surrounded the cars, and altogether, from all we can learn, presented as debased specimens of humanity as any in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We would advise our people to have nothing to say to these people, and to hold no intercourse with them of any kind.
