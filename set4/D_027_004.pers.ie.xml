<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Outrages of this kind, and others too tedious to mention, perpetrated on the grandest possible scale in this State and elsewhere, have only had the effect of exasperating animosity, intensifying hatred, extinguishing every spark of Unionism that ever existed, and rendering those who were <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> once the bittered and most determined enemies of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It cannot be denied that in the beginning of this war there were many persons among us who resigned the old Union, to which they had become attached by long habit, and the traditions of their fathers, with deep regret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>There were many even who still clung to the hope that the <rs>Union</rs> would <num value="1">one</num> day be restored, after passion had subsided and reason had begun to make her voice be heard, and who would have hailed the advent of such restoration with the utmost joy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><milestone unit="column" n="2"/> They have plundered all alike &mdash; the <rs>Union</rs> man as well as the sec colonist, and they have shown to all the folly of withholding supplies from their own Government and people, in order that they may fall a prey to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We shall hear little more of that in those districts which the raiders have visited, where they know no distinction of persons, but plundered friend and foe alike with the most commendable Impartiality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Had he, in the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, sent an army so large as to make all resistance madness, and so well disciplined as to render plundering and oppression of the population impossible &mdash; had he given orders that army should protect the inhabitants, open a market wherever it moved, invite the inhabitants to bring in their commodities, and paid for them the highest prices all in gold &mdash; had he taken care that the negroes on the plantations should not be interfered with &mdash; that all such as came off should he returned with the most scrupulous fidelity, and that the masters of such as he thought fit, or was compelled to employ, should receive the highest wages for their services &mdash; had he explained to the people that this army came as friends and protectors, not as enemies and assailants &mdash; had he given orders that they should attack no man or body of men that might be assembled to oppose them, but should only repel force when it was offered, and in that case cease firing the instant the attack was repelled &mdash; had he confined his operations simply to repossessing the forts, arsenals and navy yards that had been wrested from him &mdash; it is difficult to say what might have been the result; but it is easy now to see that this was the only policy that ever had the remotest chance of success, in restoring the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Perhaps, even then, it might have failed, but the chances would have been far greater in favor of success than they ever can be again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>For there was then something very like a <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and a policy like this would have given it fearful advantages.
