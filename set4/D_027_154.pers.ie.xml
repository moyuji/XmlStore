<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> raid of the detachment from the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, by which we captured this town, we secured <num value="17">seventeen</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and <num value="36">thirty-six</num> horses; killing <num value="5">five</num> and wounding <num value="3">three</num> of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Since that time we have had another fight near this place, in which our boys <measure n="12" type="killed and wounded">killed and wounded twelve</measure>, capturing <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> men and the same number of horses, without sustaining any loss to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In town, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are pulling down all the vacant houses and many of the stables, to build themselves winter quarters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The town is not garrisoned; and as but few supplies have been taken from them, they can get along pretty well this winter it not interfered with and they are allowed to keep what they now have. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Over in <placeName key="tgn,7015770" n="1.000 22" reg="loudoun, virginia, united states">Loudoun</placeName> there has been very great destruction of private property.--The abolition incendiaries do not stop to inquire whether the barns or mills, as the case may be, belong to friend or foe, but apply the torch indiscriminately to all. Surely a retribution is in store for those people who conduct war on such a system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>There must be some &#x0022;hidden fire&#x0022; which, some time, will fall on their heads and utterly consume them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> I hear that they burned the mill of <persName n="Janney,Mister,Asa,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Janney,Asa,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Asa</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Janney</surname></persName>, formerly of your city, in which was stored about <num value="4000">four thousand</num> bushels of wheat belonging to persons in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>This is not an exceptional case, as all the other mills and most of the barns in that section of the country have, under the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> system of warfare, become a prey to the devouring element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I have not, nor can I give you, any adequate idea of what we, in this section of the <rs>State</rs>, have suffered and are suffering. </p>

<head rend="italics"><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> view of the question of putting Negroes in the army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The <orgName n="Saint Louis Republican" type="newspaper">St. Louis <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi></orgName> of the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> contains several columns, made up of articles from Confederate papers, on the subject of employing negroes in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The same issue of the paper contains the following letter on the same subject from its <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> correspondent: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>,</hi> <date value="11-04">November 4th.</date>--The agitation of the rebel leaders and press of the policy of drawing upon their able-bodied male slaves for fighting men is received by many able minds on our side with ominous forebodings of the consequences, while the interest and attention it is known to excite in official circles leave no doubt that the <rs>Government</rs> may appreciate the advantages the rebellion will derive from the proposed measures, and at the same time feels itself poorly prepared to counteract them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his supporters have, time and again, defended his emancipation and negro soldiery policy upon the plea of naked necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They have repeatedly asserted that the <rs>Government</rs> could not put down the rebellion without the assistance of negro soldiers. &#x0022;I am satisfied this war cannot be waged successfully according to Democratic &#x0022;arithmetic, &#x0022; said the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He referred to the opposition of <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> to enlisting negroes, and to the probability of their refusing the assistance of those already made soldiers in the event of succeeding to the administration of the <rs>Government</rs> and prosecution of the war. For the sake of argument, let his assertion stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Now, how about <hi rend="italics">his</hi> arithmetic?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He has confessed he cannot succeed in the war without the assistance of the <num value="200000">200,000</num> negroes now in Federal uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Suppose the <rs>South</rs> puts <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> negro troops in the field, and more than neutralize the military power of his <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Why, then, according to his own premises, <hi rend="italics">it will be impossible to put down the rebellion.</hi>--No wonder the prospect of the <rs>South</rs> calling on her slaves strikes him with consternation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The experience of this war has pretty well dissipated the false idea, inculcated in the minds of Northern people by the teaching of abolitionism &mdash; fanaticism &mdash; that <persName n="Turner,,Nat,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Turner,Nat,,,"><foreName>Nat</foreName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> embodied the representative characteristics of the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves; yet there are many now in the <rs>Northern States</rs> who, though compelled to admit, with evident disappointment and disgust, that they have modified their views upon the subject, still believe the natural instinct of the slave is hatred toward his <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> master, and therefore deride the idea that any considerable number of the servile race can be induced to take up arms in support of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Experience alone must teach these skeptics of their error. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Does any <num value="1">one</num> doubt the <rs>South</rs> can raise, equip and put in the field <num value="300000">three-hundred thousand</num> negro soldiers, who will prove as efficient to her in a military cause as our sable auxiliaries prove to us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Let us see. She has full <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of slaves; and among them there is a much larger proportion of able-bodied men than among the same number of whites in any country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If she could contribute <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="5">five</num> of her white population to the war, she can certainly contribute <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="2">two</num> of her slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The only difficulty will arise from the necessary reduction of her agricultural producers; but this will hardly prove so much as an inconvenience, since, owing to the influx into her present limited territory of slaves from States overrun by our armies, she can readily spare <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> able-bodied negroes without serious damage to her producing resources. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Will they fight? &#x0022;There's the rub,&#x0022; derisively exclaims the <name>Abolitionist</name>, who thinks he knows more of the natural instinct and educated sympathy of the <rs>Southern</rs> slave than he knows of those of his own race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Says he, with confidence, &#x0022; You may raise, arm and put them in the field, but they won't fight like our negro soldiers.&#x0022; What foundation has he for this flattering conclusion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Men fight at the bidding of incentives of many kinds, and their valor is called forth in proportion as their incentives are strong or weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Array an army of Southern slaves against an army of Federal negroes, as the <rs>South</rs> proposes, and which will have the strongest incentive to fight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Certainly the <rs>Southern</rs> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The best part of our negro auxiliaries are impressed in the army; and those of the remainder that are not bribed into the service by bounties, take up arms only to secure the necessaries of life-- food and clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The small per cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>that fight voluntarily must know that their assistance will never be properly appreciated or recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Looking beyond the war, they see but little in their future lot above a condition of slavery to the white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>What incentives have those classes to fight that cannot be found influencing the <rs>Southern</rs> slave to fight in the interest of the rebellion?-- The latter are offered their freedom and <measure n="50acres" type="area">fifty acres</measure> of land in the <rs>South</rs>, which guarantees them a home in the land claiming all their native sympathies and associations, while the former fight for nought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> So far, we have only viewed the different <hi rend="italics">interests</hi> which prevail on the respective sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But there is another influence at work upon the <rs>Southern</rs> slave tending to make him play the part of a faithful soldier to the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is that relation, affection and sympathy between himself and master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Its existence was once generally discredited in the <rs>North</rs>, in spite of manifold proofs; but the war has furnished too many notorious incidents of the devotion of a majority of the slaves to allow it longer to be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of slaves follow their masters, be they in the ranks or at the head of armies, through the dangers of the battle field, and many have laid down their lives as the price of the temerity dictated by their love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Those who had not already got upon the seats, jumped upon them and joined the more prominent leaders of the opposition in a volley of hissing and yelling that was perfectly indescribable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/><persName n="Powell,Mister,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="default:Powell,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Powell</surname></persName>, who is generally known as &#x0027;the working man,&#x0027; and usually takes part in meetings having similar objects in view to this <num value="1">one</num>, advanced to the front of the platform and essayed to address the meeting; but he had no sooner uttered the word &#x0027;Gentlemen,&#x0027; than he was assailed by the most discordant sounds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> &#x0022;Some person near the door had excited the ill-feeling of those around him by uttering sentiments contrary to those entertained by the majority of the meeting, and a cry of &#x0027;Turn him out&#x0027; was raised, which served to divert attention from the upper end of the hall to the point indicated, and <persName n="Powell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="nearbymention:Powell,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Powell</surname></persName> endeavored to avail himself of this diversion; but the utterance of the word &#x0027;Gentlemen&#x0027; acted like a talisman, and the crowd, forgetting the unlucky wight who had ventured to express his opinions as it were in the enemy's camp, returned to their &#x0027;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> love,&#x0027; and seemed determined to cry the bold <rs>Powell</rs> down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The meeting cheered for <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> until they were literally hoarse, and groaned for &#x0027;<persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>&#x0027; with equal vehemence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The Workingman again made a feeble attempt to address the meeting, and assured them that they were defeating their own object; but this line of argument was futile; it failed to obtain him anything approaching a hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>He shouted at the top of his voice, &#x0027;I am here merely to move a chairman; won't you have a chairman?&#x0027; but in the dire confusion which then existed his words could not have been heard beyond the reach of the reporters' table immediately underneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>An individual in the back gallery here called out, &#x0027;<persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> forever!&#x0027; a sentiment which evoked the heartiest responses, cheer following cheer in quick succession, and increasing in intensity as the applause proceeded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>There is no manliness about you.&#x0027; [Derisive cheers and laughter.] The speaker begged leave to move that <persName n="Warren,,Algernon,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="default:Warren,Algernon,,,"><foreName>Algernon</foreName> <surname>Warren</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, take the chair, and then resumed his seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The meeting not hearing what he stated, and conceiving that they had at last conquered him, cheered vociferously, and waved their hats with the wildest enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The refrain was <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> sung again and again, and the chairman's patience having been exhausted, he resumed his seat, and was loudly cheered for having thus admitted his defeat, and again the refrain of the bacchanalian ditty was taken up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> &#x0022;An occupant of a seat upon the platform here came forward, and putting his <num value="2">two</num> hands to his mouth, shouted, &#x0027;Hear both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But the meeting had evidently made up their minds to hear neither side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>An elderly man in the middle of the room, standing upon a seat, with frantic gesticulations and the waving of his cap, demanded something upon the rights of an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs>, but what it was he desired no <num value="1">one</num> could tell, for even to those immediately around him it was but dumb show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The meeting, conceiving that they had found fresh food for fun in the impromptu orator, crowded around him. Stools were thrown down; a scene of great confusion ensued, and an attempt was made to force him on the platform; but the old gentleman declined the honors they would thrust upon him, subsided into silence, and was lost in the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>A cry was raised in the body of the room to clear the platform of the sympathizers with <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and no sooner was the suggestion made, than several <num value="100">hundred</num> persons came surging over the seats like an immense wave, and in the foremost rank was distinguished the stalwart form of a grenadier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> &#x0022;The promoters of the meeting clustered around each other and formed a sort of secret conclave, discussing, it was presumed, the course best to be pursued; but what resolution they came to we know not, excepting that they stood their ground for some <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> or <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour after the enemy had successfully assaulted their &#x0027;position.&#x0027;--A number of Lincolnites endeavored to improve the occasion of being brought into contact with their opponents by arguing in favor of &#x0027;Old Abe;&#x0027; but it was throwing words away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>With mock earnestness a publican advanced towards the centre of the platform, and seeing him come, those in the vicinity drew back on either side, leaving a space by the chairman clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Behind the table, and great, even in defeat, were the devoted band of Federals, and <persName n="Cossham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="nearbymention:Cossham,Handel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cossham</surname></persName>, foremost among them, seeing the burly form approaching, courteously removed his hat, and went forward to ask what was wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The publican, instead of proposing any plan for quelling the disturbance, as <persName n="Cossham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="nearbymention:Cossham,Handel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cossham</surname></persName> perhaps expected, requested to know if he could have the sixpence which he had paid for admission returned, upon which some <num value="1">one</num> inquired ironically whether <num value="2">two</num> <num value="3">three</num> penny pieces would do instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>In the midst of the scuttle the table was seized and turned upside down, and hurled off the platform, while, to show the wreck which had been made, a chair minus legs was held up, and benches bereft of supports were thrown down. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> &#x0022;Whilst this scene was being enacted, numerous incidents of an amusing character were witnessed in various parts of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> suggested that a glass of beer should be sent for <sic>for</sic> <persName n="Cossham,,Handel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="default:Cossham,Handel,,,"><foreName>Handel</foreName> <surname>Cossham</surname></persName> &mdash; a remark which was provocative of much laughter, and <num value="2">two</num> respectably-dressed persons immediately under the platform indulged in some strong expressions as to the merits and demerits of the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, and an animated conversation was brought to a conclusion by <num value="1">one</num> challenging the other &#x0027;just to come outside.&#x0027; Small shot and dried peas were thrown in great quantities about the hall, to the discomfort of many timid persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Cheers were given for <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and resounded through the room again and again; and on an excited individual in the middle of the room, declaring that he wished to address the meeting in favor of the <rs>South</rs>, loud cries for &#x0027;silence&#x0027; were raised, and many seemed disposed to give him a hearing; but when the disturbance had almost been quelled, and the meeting had subsided into something approaching order, the gas was lowered, and there was a general rush towards the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>A vast number, however, remained in the room, and an individual in the back gallery commenced singing some ditty &mdash; a parody on &#x0027;<persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s body&#x0027;--the burthen of which was that they would &#x0027;hang <persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to a sour apple tree,&#x0027; and the chorus, which was heartily joined in, &#x0027;Glory, glory, hallelujah.&#x0027; <num value="3">Three</num> cheers for the defeat of Cossham were then demanded and responded to, and the gas was further lowered, but the ruse did not this time succeed, and very few left the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>A person from the platform suggested that now they had got the room to themselves (the promoters of the meeting having left) they should pass a vote of thanks to <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and give <num value="3">three</num> cheers for the people of <placeName reg="Bristol, Bucks, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086667">Bristol</placeName> for the noble manner in which they had shown their true sentiments that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Let them also give <num value="3">three</num> groans for <persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who knew how to use the bowie knife, but not the bayonet, so that he might learn what was the feeling of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> with regard to him. The same individual also proposed a vote of censure upon those who had convened the meeting, and though he spoke amid great confusion, he obtained a hearing, which was refused to the many others who attempted to speak.
