<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> There is a powerful <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> at <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, consisting principally of <num value="4">four</num> large ships of war. The destination of this imposing armada is of course unknown here.--An expedition will probably start shortly or an attack on some point on the <rs>Southern</rs> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is supposed by some persons that the fleet will proceed to <placeName reg="Brunswick, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2022283">Brunswick, Ga.</placeName>, (a <unclear>ine </unclear> harbor;) others say, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> or New Orleans; while a few think we shall soon have <q>&#x0022;particular thunder and lightning&#x0022;</q> in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> and farther up <placeName reg="Norfolk harbor">Norfolk harbor</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Notwithstanding the densely crowded audience at the <rs type="place">Opera House</rs>, recently mentioned, that splendid hall was again packed with having humanity last night, and the concert given by the <rs>Amateur Minstrels</rs>, of the <rs>Lynchburg</rs> and <orgName n="Huger Artillery" type="artillery">Huger artillery</orgName> companies, afforded a very high degree of gratification and amusement to all present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The performance were most admirably done, giving evidence of the possession of musical talent and artistic ability of a very superior order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The personation of negro characters has never been surpassed in this city, and the roars of laughter indicated the intense delight of the audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Exquisite singing and soul-stirring instrumental music, with many a well-acted piece of drollery, in imitation of plantation life in the <rs>South</rs>, combined to render the entrainment <num value="1">one</num> of rare interest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The proceeds will be handed over to the <rs>Ladies</rs>' <orgName n="Aid Society" type="society">Aid Society</orgName>, for distribution among the needy families of volunteers of this city, and a handsome amount will be thus added to the fund, which will be appreciated to the best advantage by those having the matter under their careful charge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> This plan to raise money for the relief of soldiers' wives and children, and its entire and almost unexpected and unparalleled success, shows very plainly, not only a liberal and sympathetic feeling with regard to the wants and privations caused by the existing war, but also a decided fondness for good music and the particular kind of performances mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Indeed, we have here no exhibition room of sufficient dimensions to admit the multitudes that go in anxious crowds to hear the singing and witness the laughable performances of the fun- making soldiers, who so willingly give a small portion of their time and employ their rare talents in behalf of the needily and the brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>During the <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> other concerts will be given for the benefit of those in want of aid. I learn that there will be ere long a <unclear>conceptruction</unclear> of artistic talent and ability in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, from the ranks of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiery, and that some very rich and rare exhibitions and musical entertainments may be expected at the <rs>Capital</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> War maters are progressing as usual, but there is no news worthy of note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Our city is unusually quiet; there have been some street disturbances, but they were easily and quietly arranged by the military police force, whose vigilance and prompt performance of duty in every emergency prevent the occurrence of affrays and disorderly conduct; liable often to result in personal injury, and even loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Such cases of disorder have been but seldom since the establishment of the regular <orgName n="City Guard" type="guard">city guard</orgName> by <persName n="Huger,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Huger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Huger</surname></persName>, who, with the urbane, quiet manner and true dignity of a prominent general officer, is ever active in the performance of his duties, in all respects in which the public good is concerned in these war times. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> The next day Lefort had still the long face and the grieved air of the previous day. He had wished to resume his lease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The apartment was let for a term of <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>It is the right sort of man &mdash; or rather it is a woman; here is woman's furniture, this toilet, this wash-table, this book-stand of inlaid work.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> <q>&#x0022;How shall we find out that?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> He opened the toilet table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>There was a small comb, to which was attached <num value="2">two</num> magnificent hairs of golden blond. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> <q>&#x0022;Good,&#x0022;</q> this hair does not belong to an old woman; let us look further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/><q>&#x0022;It is the portrait of a married woman; the dress indicates it. This woman was about <num value="20">twenty</num> when it was painted.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> <q>&#x0022;I speak very seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Your furniture seems made to go with that of the lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The suite of rooms is too large for <num value="1">one</num> of you alone; it is exactly what is wanted for you <num value="2">two</num>. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> <q>&#x0022;But I don't wish to marry.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> <q>&#x0022;You are wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>She pleases me, this woman, and I wish you to marry her. Let me manage.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> Lefort gave him leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>When the lady came from the country, she was surprised to find her rooms occupied and her furniture doubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Decamps awaited her. He showed the lady the rooms arranged by himself, and the portrait of Lefort hung up opposite her own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> <q>&#x0022;See, madame,&#x0022;</q> said he, <q>&#x0022;what wonderful harmony between these articles of furniture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>See how well the portrait matches your own. It is certainly the portrait of the man who should be your husband.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> The lady was sensible and kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>She was not angry, and laughed heartily, and as he was an intelligent man, <hi rend="italics">distingue,</hi> a very good fellow, with a suitable fortune, he was accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He married the widow and did not leave the rooms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> He never left them until last year at the death of his wife whom he adored, and whom he rendered happy till the last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Decamps remained their friend, and both, whenever they saw him, thanked him for having made the marriage of their furniture. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Our Government has just gone into operation, and while all agree that the war we are involved in should be vigorously prosecuted, and continued, if necessary, as long as Southern blood runs warm in Southern veins, it is also essential that our Government should be established on such a basis as to secure all our rights and stand the test of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>To such an end it is the duty of the people, with especial care, to guard the representative feature of our Government, as upon the faithful discharge of the representative trust is based <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> liberty.
