<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The most important news from the lines below <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> is, that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the enemy transferred a heavy body of troops to the south side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><num value="10">Ten</num> pieces of cannon went along with this column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>To judge by past experience, this move pretends some offensive operation against our right, on the south of the town of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>; or it is a feint, designed to induce us to weaken our line fronting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>. It has been <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s practice only to move when about to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He moves and strikes without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But, <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> having already elapsed since this last movement, and nothing having come of it, it may be he has tired of his old strategy and is about to try something new. It is also possible the movement was intended to meet some apprehended attack from us; for, be it known, since the recent occasion on which our troops swooped down on <persName n="Kantz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Kantz,nomatch:0"><surname>Kantz</surname></persName> and <persName n="Birney,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Birney,nomatch:0"><surname>Birney</surname></persName>, and drove them from the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have not had an easy moment, so great is their dread of a repetition of the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This we know from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deserters, and also from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pickets, who do not hesitate to declare their apprehensions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The complete and formidable character of our fortifications, running from a point opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> north to the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road, may have something to do with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s withdrawing forces from their front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He assailed them repeatedly and desperately last <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, and must feel convinced they are impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This being the case, any advance for <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> on the north side of the <rs>James</rs> must be by some route avoiding these works, which route can only be found by making a circuit of <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure>. He must go back to <placeName reg="New Market, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7016287">New Market</placeName>, and thence strike northeast across <placeName reg="White Oak Swamp, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2766789">White Oak swamp</placeName> to the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road, at Bottom's bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He is hardly prepared to make this trip. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> As everything concerning the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and their operations immediately in front of this city must be interesting to our readers, we may state that they have at length completed to their satisfaction the defences of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, and have thrown into it a garrison of <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men. A number of guns have been mounted on the fort in embrasures, but they have not yet opened upon our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Every morning at sunrise they are discharged, for the purpose of keeping them in order and ready for use. Our men in the trenches, some <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards distant</measure>, watch the movements of the enemy in this fort with great interest, especially the firing of the morning guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> It was reported yesterday morning that the enemy, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, attempted to throw a pontoon bridge from Cox. wharf to the south side of the <rs>James</rs>, but were driven off by shells from our gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><placeName reg="Cox wharf">Cox wharf</placeName> is immediately this side of <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap, and it is likely the enemy would desire very much to put a column across the river at this point, as by so doing they would menage the left and rear of the <placeName reg="Howlett Picuse">Howlett Picuse</placeName> battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We have no fear they will succeed in such an undertaking were they to attempt it. We have gunboats and other things which are all- sufficient to keep the waters clear between <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He has put to work in it some prisoners recently taken from us; in retaliation, he says, for our putting negro captives upon our fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We think he will find our men neither willing nor efficient allies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Passengers by last night's train from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> report that information had reached there of a fight which had occurred at Sickley's shop, beyond <placeName reg="Fishers Hill, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2328677">Fisher's hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A detachment of our men, having gone down the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> to that point, were attacked by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who, supposing that it was only a cavalry force, attacked them with some impetuosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The horsemen fell back, and the enemy following, soon fell in with our infantry, who fell upon them with a vengeance, killing and capturing a very large number.

This would entail upon us an annual interest of <measure n="140000000dollars" type="currency">$140,000,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> &#x0022;Why should our ability to bear this burthen be doubted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Before this war it was alleged (and, in my opinion, with great truth,) that a sum fully as great as this was annually paid in tribute to the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Why should it not be paid with equal case to our own Government, by whom it will be returned to us in the payment of interest? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> &#x0022;It may be supposed by some that the magnitude of the debt, in proportion to our property, may lead to general insolvency and bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Let us examine the grounds of this possible apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>If a planter, whose property before the war was worth <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure>, sell during its progress wheat, corn, etc., to the value of <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure>, and take Government bonds for the amount, how does it incur the risk of being ruined?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>And what is true of <num value="1">one</num> citizen in this respect, or of <num value="1">one</num> class, is equally true of the whole community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> &#x0022;The alarm must arise from inattention to the important consideration that we are selling to the <rs>Government</rs>, year by year, only the surplus of our annual productions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> &#x0022;There is <num value="1">one</num> way, however, in which the debt may be made oppressive, as the following transaction will show: The Government paid, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, <measure n="300000dollars" type="currency">$300,000</measure> for certain supplies, and the party who received this sum bought with it, from a foreigner, <measure n="15000dollars" type="currency">$15,000</measure> in gold, deliverable in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.--With the <measure n="300000dollars" type="currency">$300,000</measure> thus obtained the foreigner then bought an equal amount of Government bonds, bearing <num value="0.07">seven per cent</num> per annum interest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> &#x0022;It follows that, at the end of this war, for <measure n="15000dollars" type="currency">$15,000</measure> thus acquired by the citizen, the <rs>Government</rs> will owe a debt of <measure n="300000dollars" type="currency">$300,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> &#x0022;The citizen will receive annually <measure n="1050dollars" type="currency">$1,050</measure> interest; the <rs>Government</rs> will pay annually <measure n="21000dollars" type="currency">$21,000</measure>. Had he, on the contrary, bought the bonds himself, the <measure n="21000dollars" type="currency">$21,000</measure> annually paid by the <rs>Government</rs> would have been received by <num value="1">one</num> of its own citizens, and the country, as a whole, would have been neither richer nor poorer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>I would earnestly impress upon your consideration that, when traced through all their various ratifications, this is at last the uniform result of every case in which supplies are sold to the <rs>Government</rs> and property of any description is bought with the money to the exclusion of Government securities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> &#x0022;It should be borne in mind that we have now no commercial class in this country; that the banks have a limited capital of about <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure>, and, beyond this sum, have no power to purchase Government bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The great mass of our citizens, then, of every class, must combine and take Government securities, and nothing else, in exchange for Treasury notes, or the public debt must infallibly go abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>There is no single class of our own citizens who have the power to purchase and hold <measure n="1500000000dollars" type="currency">$1,500,000,000</measure> of bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The question, then, is between public debt being taken by our entire population, of all classes, or by foreigners, in the manner and on the terms already indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Judging from present indications, there will no difficulty in finding purchasers for our bonds among those who are sending them abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Shall they be allowed to go abroad?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>There can be no escape from the ultimate payment of the debt; if held by foreigners, we could not evade it if we would; if held by our own people, we would not if we could; and under no circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>I trust, would a suggestion so dishonorable be gravely entertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> &#x0022;The expenditures depend, in a great degree, upon the prices you shall fix; to you alone have Congress confided the power of exercising any control over this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>And through you may those engaged in furnishing supplies to the <rs>Government</rs>, and for the payment of whom the public debt is created, most easily and naturally learn how much better they are served when your moderation in restraining the public expenditures confines within more prudent limits the mortgage upon your estates, and with how much greater safety they may themselves become the purchasers of these mortgages than permit them to pass into the hands of foreigners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> &#x0022;The whole question, complicated as it may at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appear, is perfectly simple, and lies in a nutshell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Congress has ordered the following expenditures to be made, namely: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> 
<table rows="4" cols="2">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> &#x0022;They have directed these expenditures to be paid for in Treasury notes and in certificates of indebtedness bearing <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> interest and free from taxation; and for the security and ultimate redemption of the <name>Treasury</name> notes they have provided non-taxable <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> bonds, which they direct me to sell for Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> &#x0022;If we suppose the purchases to have been made, and the community to be in possession of the <measure n="300000000dollars" type="currency">$300,000,000</measure> of Treasury notes, the next question is, will they pass them about from hand to hand in exchange for property at extravagant prices until they gradually fall into the hands of foreigners and are exchanged by them for Confederate bonds, or will every citizen take the <rs>Government</rs> bonds himself ! I have endeavored to prove that our true interest consists in following the latter course.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> Richard Drew, free, and <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName>, slave of <placeName reg="Ann Ford">Ann Ford</placeName>, and <persName n="Carter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Carter,nomatch:0"><surname>Carter</surname></persName>, slave of <persName n="Keesee,,Jacob,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="default:Keesee,Jacob,F.,,"><foreName>Jacob</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Keesee</surname></persName>, were charged with burglariously entering the storehouse of <persName n="Hoeflich,,Jacob,N.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="default:Hoeflich,Jacob,N.,,"><foreName>Jacob</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Hoeflich</surname></persName>, on the night of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th instant</day></dateStruct>, and stealing several <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars'</measure> worth of sugar, molasses, coffee, tobacco, &#x0026;c. This case was referred to yesterday morning, when it was stated that the proof against the accused was very strong, as a part of the stolen goods was found on their premises, and was therefore virtually in their possession.--For reasons, however, deemed sufficient by His Honor, no investigation took place yesterday, and the prisoners were remanded for a future hearing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> The charge against <persName n="Collins,Mrs.,Mary,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="default:Collins,Mary,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, of assaulting and beating <persName n="Winholdt,,Elizabeth,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="default:Winholdt,Elizabeth,,,"><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <surname>Winholdt</surname></persName>, was again taken up and witnesses examined as to the character of the parties to the prosecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Against <persName n="Winholdt,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="nearbymention:Winholdt,Elizabeth,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Winholdt</surname></persName> very hard things were said, and a petition was presented, purporting to have been signed by &#x0022;the neighbors,&#x0022; requesting the authorities to have her removed as an annoying nuisance to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Upon the subject of the petition, <persName n="Davis,Mister,John,N.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="default:Davis,John,N.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, counsel, intimated that the signatures to it were forged, whereupon his Honor continued the case till this morning, and directed subp&#x0153;nas to be issued against all the signers for their appearance also. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> The complainant in the case against <persName n="Reagan,,Monteith,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="default:Reagan,Monteith,,,"><foreName>Monteith</foreName> <surname>Reagan</surname></persName> and <persName n="Briton,,Antonio,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="default:Briton,Antonio,,,"><foreName>Antonio</foreName> <surname>Briton</surname></persName>, <num value="2">two</num> very young white boys, charging them with stealing a pair of pantaloons from <persName n="Lorman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Lorman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lorman</surname></persName>, not appearing as witnesses, the matter was dismissed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> <persName n="Gaiser,Mrs.,R.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="default:Gaiser,R.,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Gaiser</surname></persName> was fined <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> for violating the market ordinance in buying apples to sell again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> The completion of the return from the <rs>North</rs> leave no doubt with regard to the re-election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>For our own part, we are in no way disconcerted or disappointed, for we have never, for <num value="1">one</num> moment, entertained a doubt that the result would be precisely such as it is new evident to all that it must be. Nor, to speak the truth, are we displeased with the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>We have always regarded <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> as the most dangerous man for the <rs>Confederacy</rs> that could possibly have been put in nomination for the <rs>Northern Presidency</rs>; nor do we see any reason new to doubt that our opinion was well founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>He has proclaimed himself a war candidate, although placed by his friends upon a peace platform.--He avows, at the risk of losing many votes, his determination to prosecute the war to the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>He avows his determination, if elected, to place the prosecution of hostilities upon a footing consistent with the usages of civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Had he been elected, there is every probability that the policy of armistices and peace conventions &mdash; the most dangerous policy that could possibly have been inaugurated for our cause &mdash; would have been pushed to consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Besides all this, he is a man of large military experience, and knows far better than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> how to handle the immense forces placed at the command of a President of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We are gratified, then, at the escape we think we have made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It might have been infinitely worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We are, indeed, confident that it would have been. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> We now are pretty sure of what we have to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Not only is <persName n="President,,Abraham,Lincoln,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="default:President,Abraham,Lincoln,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <foreName>Lincoln</foreName> <surname>President</surname></persName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the next <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> after the <date value="1865-03-04">4th of March, 1865, </date> but he goes in with a majority large enough to sustain him in any atrocity he may meditate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The majority of the <rs>North</rs> have pretty clearly declared themselves well pleased with the war and with the manner of conducting it. They endorse all the atrocities of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, all the cruelties of <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, all the crimes of <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, all the murders of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, all the butchery and barbarism of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The conflagrations of our towns and villages, the deportation of our women and children, the starvation of whole populations, the instigations of our slaves to murder and robbery, an aggravation of all the horrors of war, in its most horrible aspects, where the passions are left entirely without control, and every appliance is used to stimulate them, until, by their indulgence, men become devils &mdash; all these things, the virtuous, intelligent, civilized, christian, religious North--the heirs of the best government the sun ever shone upon &mdash; have deliberately approved of as applied to us. And we accept the application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Indeed, there is no way of escape, did we even desire to avoid the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>There can be no shuffling in the ranks now. Every man must know his place, and must keep it. The issue is not peace or war, but freedom or slavery, existence or extermination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> It is best for the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to understand, once for all, that their hopes consist in their arms alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>If victorious, they can command the issue; if defeated, the issue will very certainly command them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>They are contending with an enemy who will listen to no terms short of absolute submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Let us hear no more cries for peace, but let every man make up his mind to war. We have hitherto been extremely averse to regard the war as anything more than a sort of episode in our existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We must in future look upon it as the main business of our lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>All our thoughts must turn in that direction, as they have hitherto been turned upon the means of procuring a livelihood and establishing ourselves in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Everything we do must, from this day forth, have some relation to the conduct of the war. Our army must be made a regular army; hitherto it has been nothing more than a body of volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Our cavalry system must be reformed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We must give up money making and devote ourselves to the pursuits that will best assist in carrying on the war. Better to make a few dollars less for the time being, than to make it for the benefit of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We have become accustomed to hardships and self denial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>They will become even easier to us than they are at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Above all, let not our people be deluded by the cry of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It has done them an immense deal of harm already, and it will do them a great deal more if they listen to it. There is, at present, no prospect of peace, nor will there be as long as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> continue to believe themselves gaining victories every day. There will be now, until they shall have become convinced that their efforts to subdue are unavailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>This conviction we shall be compelled to beat into their heads; and in order that we may do so, it is necessary that every man should be at his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Rampant as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> now are for war, their tens would charge immediately should <num value="1">one</num> of their armies be destroyed; for they would find it difficult to replace it. In the meantime, we are convinced that if we can hold our own through this winter &mdash; as most certainly we can &mdash; the worst will have been post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Our enemy can never make such an offer as <unclear></unclear> made and is now making. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
