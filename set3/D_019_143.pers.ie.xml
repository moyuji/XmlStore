<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The present political status of our Commonwealth imposes upon us increased responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The large publishing houses of all denominations are located in the <rs>North</rs>.--We have not a house for printing Bibles in the entire <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The new position of our country will doubtless induce a conviction that <hi rend="italics">literary</hi> is scarcely less important to us than <hi rend="italics">political</hi> enfranchisement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Publishing houses will spring into being and vigor throughout our young <q>&#x0022;nationality&#x0022;</q>--the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>In no way can we better direct attention to this sphere of enterprise, and at the same time give a pledge of success to those who embark in it, than by increasing facilities for the circulation of good books among our own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When it is seen that, as a denomination, we are ready to scatter broadcast over the land publications at once <name>Christian</name> and Southern, our best men will not be slow to avail themselves of an opportunity to give enduring form to their best thoughts, and capitalists will be swift to invest their funds in what must then prove a most lucrative department of business.--Happily, the dictates of religion and the suggestions of patriotism coincide here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>As we would be a free people, as we would be a people <q>&#x0022;called after the name&#x0022;</q> of the <rs>Lord</rs>, so must we make our hands strong for this work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> There will now be increased need that we do our own work in this department without relying upon societies located at the <rs>North</rs>; for those societies, (even if we should grant that they might <hi rend="italics">deserve.</hi>) are not likely to <hi rend="italics">enjoy</hi> the sympathy of Southern people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The South must build up a Christian literature for herself; no other can be thoroughly adapted to her needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The purveyors of her theology must be men whom she can trust and honor &mdash; because they are her sons, and count not their own lives dear unto themselves if the sacrifice be necessary for the vindication of her rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of the chief lessons read to us out of the troubled page of the times; and may we be wise to lay it to heart! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The presence of large armies in our State affords us a fine opportunity for colportage effort among the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>They are exposed to peculiar temptations, and in no way can we better aid them to resist these than by affording them good books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>There is scarcely another such school of vice on the earth as the <name>Encampment</name>, and we must counteract its hurtful teaching by the <q> &#x0022;book of books,&#x0022;</q> and by volumes and tracts of kindred influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> In your paper of the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th instant</day></dateStruct>, you quote from a correspondent in <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>, who advises those who have left that vicinity to return and take care of their property, intimating that if they had remained at home their property would not have been pillaged and destroyed as it has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>This sounds very well to the ear and looks very well on paper; it is also perfectly in accordance with proclamations that have been issued by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, and perfectly in accordance with the rules of civilized warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>But how does it accord with the facts that have actually taken place?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In the general stampede from <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> and vicinity, there were many families who could not get away and not a few who, trusting to the faith of the proclamations and other promises of the vandal invaders, remained at home to <q>&#x0022;protect their property. &#x0022;</q> How did these citizens fare?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Not a whit better than those who left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Indiscriminate plunder has been the rule and occasional exemption the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/><q>&#x0022;To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Jones,Colonel,Carey,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Jones,Carey,S.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Carey</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> staid at home to protect his property, and yet the vandals not only stole his property before his eyes; but actually fired at him <num value="6">6</num> or <num value="7">7</num> shots, either with a view to kill him or scare him away, that they might plunder the more freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>And when an officer under <rs type="role">Col.</rs> P. was ascertained to have gone out with his men on a plundering expedition, and summoned into the presence of the <rs>Colonel</rs>, this officer not only did not deny the charge, but coolly remarked that <q>&#x0022;war always made plunder free.&#x0022;</q> The <placeName reg="Colorado" key="tgn,7007158">Col.</placeName>, who is much of a gentleman, looked ashamed, but did not, perhaps dared not, even rebuke his subordinate.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> Let me tell your correspondent, however honest he may be, that the presence of a family is no guarantee for the protection of their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Several of their officers have told me the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><num value="1">One</num>, a Zouave <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, told the writer of this, that he was surprised that the people should have left their property unprotected; that they were not barbarians, and did not come there to plunder or destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But that is all gammon; plunder and destruction have been the rule of the invaders ever since they stepped on <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Some of the officers, and even some of the men, may be men of honor, and cordially despise these depredators, but that does not prevent the rascally portion of them from doing what they please. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> I could add to the above facts many others and give the names of sufferers, but let these suffice to illustrate scores of a similar character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> Besides plunder, the most contemptible acts of petty tyranny have been resorted to by the <rs>Lincoln</rs> <q>&#x0022;protectors of public property.&#x0022;</q>--<num value="1">One</num> instance will suffice to illustrate this: <persName n="Adams,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="nearbymention:Adams,George,F.,,"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> That we are on the eve of some great event, movements which have taken place within the past week, and which are continuing daily, too plainly indicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Extraordinary vigilance enjoined upon our sentinels, an unusually rigid enforcement of military discipline, and the constant state of readiness in which we are required to hold ourselves, are regarded as preliminary to the hour when the souls of men are tried, when the feelings of the heart struggles with the weakness of the flesh; when life and right are thrown into the scale against might, and the issue left to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> It is perhape an inevitable, while it is a very painful characteristic of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> politics in the present times, that differences of opinion beget violent personal animosities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Hitherto there has been no time when <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, differing from each other however remotely, could not peacefully and quietly discuss the most radical questions; and now there is no trouble in talking freely <num value="1">one</num>'s opinion of direct taxation or the tariff; but when any line of policy relating to the war is brought up as a subject of discussion, the excited state of men's minds become manifest, and if there be any great difference of opinion, the result is apt to be a pretty severe use of words, if not actually a resort to blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Only a few weeks ago, the newspapers abounded in accounts of men being knocked down in the street for what was styled <q> &#x0022;treasonable sympathies;&#x0022;</q> and some of the newspapers endeavored to fan the flame by heading such statements with <q>&#x0022;served him right,&#x0022;</q> or something similar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>This state of affairs is fortunately past; but men's minds are still strongly influenced by their feelings, and too many are impatient of any voice that speaks of peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> The newspaper press has been greatly to blame in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Some weeks ago the word <q> &#x0022;treason&#x0022;</q> has acquired a new and broad signification in the columns of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> In short, whatever is said, whatever is proposed, whatever is advocated that does not meet the views of the war newspapers, is treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>For the <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> papers to argue that in war times the letter of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is to be disregarded, and the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ought to assume and exercise the powers of a dictator, is not treason. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>They expected that their immense military demonstration would scare us from our propriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>They indulged in terrible threats of confiscating the property and taking possession of the women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The forces of the <rs>South</rs> mustered as rapidly as their own, and an aptitude for war was displayed by her people as great as that of the <rs>North</rs> for commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It was no nation of braggarts which the <rs>North</rs> soon found confronting her; it was a nation represented by such calm and self-poised minds, such high-souled and courteous gentlemen as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.</hi> It was a nation which rose up &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; with <num value="1">one</num> heart and <num value="1">one</num> arm, to defend its liberties against oppression, and its soil against invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Such a nation, occupying such an extent of territory, cannot be conquered by a <q>&#x0022;short, sharp war.&#x0022;</q>--It will be a war much longer than the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> All accounts from the <rs>North</rs> represent the condition of the mercantile and manufacturing classes there as deplorable in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Every sort of property has fallen in value, business is utterly prostrated, failures are of daily occurrence and of enormous magnitude, and all interests and classes are on the high way to ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The chief market, the only market of any great magnitude, for Northern manufactures, was at the <rs>South</rs>; and by the suicidal policy of their own Government, that market is cut off from them completely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/> The case is even worse with the <rs>West</rs>.--The only very considerable market for Western produce was at the <rs>South</rs>; for the white laborer on the <rs>Western</rs> prairie fed the negro laborer on the cotton plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The negro could earn <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> a year by working at the cotton crop, and only a <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> by raising grain.--Hence the planters upon the rivers and railroads preferred to purchase their grain and pork rather than take off their negroes from the cotton crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>There was thus opened an immense market for the products of the <rs>West</rs> through all the cotton-growing country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>This large and lucrative market is closed to the <rs>Western</rs> farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>This calamity has befallen them at the same time that, in consequence of the depreciation of public stocks, all Western bank notes have fallen to half the value represented on their face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>It has befallen them, too, at a time when exportations of grain to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from the <rs>Northern</rs> cities is checked by advices of unusually promising crops throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>In fact, never were a people more badly off in a business point of view than those of the <rs>West</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/> While such are the effects which the war is producing upon the <rs>North</rs>, there are no indications of ruin and bankruptcy at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>We have yet to hear, in all the <rs>Southern</rs> cities, of the failure of a single commercial house, or of a solitary bank or banking concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>While the war has caused, doubtless, a very heavy individual loss by the stoppage of business, there is so far nothing like a paralysis of credit, and overthrow of private fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>The people, doubtless, lose by the war; but they lose cheerfully and without reproach; and are more liberal, notwithstanding their losses, in contributions to the war, than they have ever been known to be before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>There are no traces of financial panic, commercial pressure, or impending wide-spread bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The people are easy in their circumstances; and, although their profits from business have been suspended, they are still not at the doors of want and poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Except the fact that business is brought to a stop, we doubt if the financial condition of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was ever more healthy and sound than at present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/> These facts go to show that the war will really prove a saving operation to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>While our intercourse with the other section was unrestricted, we were constantly carrying on with it a system of over-trading which kept our country exhausted of its resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>We bought an immense multitude of useless wares that could all have been manufactured as well at the <rs>South</rs> and have cost the community nothing, or could have been dispensed with altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>We bought so largely of every kind of merchandize and notion at the <rs>North</rs>, that the products which they took in exchange from us fell far short of paying our debt, and a very large portion of our great Southern staples exported to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> were shipped on Northern account, and the proceeds collected by the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>So large a portion of our commerce was thus turned into Northern channels that even those of our exports in return for which we received foreign instead of Northern goods had gradually come to be imported through Northern cities and by Northern jobbers for us, thus breaking up our direct trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and utterly destroying Southern commerce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> The result was, that the <rs>North</rs> not only sold us immense and unnecessary quantities of their own mean wares, taking our great staples in exchange, which they exported to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> on our own account, but they secured the manipulation of nearly all our exports, shipping all to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> on their own account, securing foreign goods in return, and selling them to the <rs>South</rs> at a profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The whole operation amounted to <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>We bought of the <rs>North</rs> foreign goods and its own products and manufactures to that amount, and turned over to it the whole management of our great staples in payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The profit of the <rs>North</rs> on this magnificent business was at least <num value="0.33">33 per cent.</num>, all of which the <rs>South</rs> saves by the war. Not only does she save the profit, but, ceasing to buy Northern goods, and compelled to manufacture herself, she saves all that she was in the habit of paying the <rs>North</rs> for those goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>It was also estimated that the <rs>South</rs> owed the <rs>North</rs> <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure> at the beginning of the war, which also is saved while the war lasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The reason, therefore, is very plain why the <rs>South</rs> is not suffering pecuniary embarrassment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The war and non-intercourse is worth to the <rs>South</rs> <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> a month; it is worth, in fact, more than the expenses of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Events have been quite stirring in the meantime, and I should have written early yesterday, but waited to get all the information that I could, as well as to get reliable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last, we learned that the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName> <orgName type="mil" key="SCVolunteer">South Carolina volunteers</orgName> were on their way to this place, under command of <persName n="Gregg,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gregg</surname></persName>, from their camp at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, distant about <measure n="7miles" type="distance">7 miles</measure> to this post, and that we were ordered back to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> as soon as they should arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>While we were on dress parade, about <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> in the evening, we heard their drums sound on the road just below us; we remained standing in line until the head of their column appeared, and met them with presented arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>After they had passed, we returned to our quarters and made preparations to leave, not very willingly, however, having no desire to go back until we had at least <num value="1">one</num> brush with our foes; but forward always, so long as there remains <num value="1">one</num> of Old Abe's apes on this side of our line, accompanied with the wish that all of our boys could be with us, that we might show those who have said that the <rs>Virginia</rs> boys could not fight, because they were too easily flurried, that the <rs>Old</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> knew how to fight, and also that they would fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/> This order for our return was countermanded by <persName n="Gregg,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Gregg</surname></persName> that night, he ordering us to remain here, while he went on some special duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Many were the suppositions formed as to their destination, but nothing could be learned but by having patience to wait for their return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>They marched through the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> and down the turnpike to a road some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> below, where they were met by a company, or rather a detachment, of the <orgName n="Alexandria Artillery" type="artillery">Alexandria Artillery</orgName>, with <num value="2">two</num> brass <num value="6">6</num>-pound field-pieces, <num value="1">one</num> of which is said to have belonged to <rs type="role2">Major</rs> <orgName n="Ringgold Battery" type="battery">Ringgold's battery</orgName> in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and looks like it had seen hard service, being pretty well marked with sabre cuts, done (so it was said) in retaking it from the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexicans</rs>, it having been captured once. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> All day <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> we listened up to <time value="5:30oclock">half past 5 o'clock</time> in the afternoon for some token of their whereabouts, when we were startled by the report of heavy firing in the direction of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, which, from its nearness, was supposed to be at a station on the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName> called <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, distant about <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> from the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs>, which was soon followed by another, and another, until we counted <num value="19">nineteen</num> reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Then all was still, and anxiety was depicted on every countenance to learn what had taken place, none of us knowing at the time that our boys had any artillery with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Of this we were soon informed, however, and were pretty well satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>We waited for news until tattoo, when we retired to our boards and blankets to rest, from which we were aroused in an hour's time by the rapid reports of firing by our pickets and scouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Again we thought certainly our time for a brush had come, and again we were doomed to meet with a bitter disappointment, learning soon that the alarm was caused by a sentinel at the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> camp, who, halting a man prowling around the outskirts of the camp, ran, and was fired upon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> We soon again were soundly sleeping, and on rising in the morning, learned that our boys had returned about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the morning, having marched about <num value="55">fifty-five</num> or <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure>; we sallied forth to get the news immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>They say they arrived in good time at <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, and destroyed the water tank, and waited patiently for the coming of the apes, until they supposed they had news that there was a force waiting for them and that they would not come, and had gotten some &#x00BC; of a mile on their return to camp when they heard the welcome sound (to them) of the engine whistle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>They immediately faced about and marched back and sent out a detachment of the <name>Wise</name> troop, of <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, to reconnoitre, who was seen by a man living at <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, who was observed to run toward the train waving his handkerchief for them to go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The whistle sounded down brakes, and the motion of the engine reversed, and the enemy began to disembark and form into line, which, the artillery observing, they began to fire upon them at about the distance of <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure>, with round shot and grape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>This threw them into confusion, and their officers could not get them to fall in line either by threats or curses; plenty of both, it is said, was bestowed on the men that had disembarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Those that were on the cars, (most of which were of the kind called flats) at the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> fire, dismounted immediately to the right and left, and broke like quarter-horses for the nearest woods, divesting themselves as they ran of everything that would impede flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>The engine was cut loose from the train, and started back to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, (it being attached to the rear of the train, minus smoke stack and <num value="1">one</num> cylinder, picking up their dead and wounded that lay in their way, and throwing them on the tender as they moved along. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> When they arrived in the city, a guard was formed around, and no <num value="1">one</num> allowed to approach to see how many were killed; but the official report in the <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName> Star, says that there were over <measure n="200" type="killed and wounded">200 killed and wounded</measure>, and I have but very little doubt myself if it would not amount to more than that, as there were a good many shots through the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>There were <num value="400">400</num> troops on the train belonging to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> Reg't <orgName type="mil" key="OHVolunteer">Ohio Volunteers</orgName>, with a large number of hands who were going to repair the bridges, &#x0026;c., with a train some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> in the rear with <num value="450">450</num> men more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>A good quantity of tools, blankets, and some few muskets and provisions, fell into our hands --some of the muskets being badly injured by the firing, several of which I have seen bent nearly double, and <num value="1">one</num> cut off entirely at the centre band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/><num value="7">Seven</num> of their dead were left on the cars, and <num value="1">one</num> man wounded by having his arm torn off at the shoulder by a grape shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>His wound was dressed by our surgeon; they do not expect him to live, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Our troops destroyed the cars, depot, and a bridge at this place, having pulled up the track when they destroyed the tank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/> Our <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> boys are in somewhat better spirits now, since they have smelt powder again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Our own boys are also in fine spirits and enjoying good health, considering the exposure they have to wet night air and open lodgings, which many of them are not used to. We have some jovial times in camp as well as some laughable and ridiculous ones, an account of some of which I may give you <num value="1">one</num> of these days, at present preferring the serious and matter-of-fact occurring.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/> The diamond is the most extraordinary production of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>From the earliest times it has been the most highly valued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>A full grown diamond exceeds in value more than a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> times its mass in gold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/> Full grown?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>Do diamonds, then, grow?--Assuredly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>A diamond is but a piece of crystalized charcoal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Burn it, and, like a piece of coal, it gives a gas of carbonic acid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>All crystals grow &mdash; they are formed by the addition of atoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>Some are dug out of the crevices of rocks, but the greater number are procured by washing over the earth and gravel with which they are mixed, as they wash for gold in <placeName key="tgn,7000490;tgn,2140674" n="0.010 000000.3296	placename;tgn,7000490;australia,Oceania;0.008 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2140674;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="australia,Oceania;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America">Australia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>For smaller stones, proportional premiums are given; so that there is a constant incitement to industry. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the largest diamonds ever found in <placeName reg="Brazil, Clay, Indiana" key="tgn,2031163">Brazil</placeName> was discovered in an unexplored region by <num value="3">three</num> convicts, who for some crime had been banished from the civilized portions of the country, into the wild and savage interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>Thus driven from society, they conceived the idea of making some discovery of such value that their sovereign, the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 98" reg="portugal">Portugal</placeName>, would grant them a pardon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>Animated by this ambition, they traversed the country for <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, exposed to the greatest dangers from savages, and the wild beasts and reptiles with which that tropical region abounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>At last, they were searching the dry bed of a river, during the drouth, hoping to find gold, but their industry was rewarded by finding a little shining pebble, about the size of a walnut, but worth a <num value="1000000">million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>The next question was, how to avail themselves of their discovery.--How did they know but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man they met might rob them of their jewel?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>They went to a priest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>He listened to their story, and took them to the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,2024623" n="1.000 10" reg="Villa Rica, Carroll, Georgia">Villa Rica</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>As soon as the <rs>Governor</rs> had seen the diamond, and satisfied himself of its genuineness, he suspended the sentence of the convicts, and sent them, the priest and the diamond, under a proper escort, to the <name>Viceroy</name> at <placeName reg="Rio Janeiro">Rio Janeiro</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>The diamond was sent in a frigate to <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 98" reg="portugal">Portugal</placeName>, and the priest sent with it to tell the story of its discovery to the <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>It is needless to say that the sovereign pardoned the convicts, and enable them to live reputably ever after, in the society to which they had returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>The devotion of the priest to their cause was also rewarded by a suitable preferment; and the diamond found by these wandering outlaws, is now the brightest jewel in the crown of <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 98" reg="portugal">Portugal</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/> In its natural state, the diamond is often a beautiful gem; but it requires to be cut into the forms in which we usually see it, before it exhibits all its flashing splendors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>The process of cutting the diamond is very slow, difficult and expensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>As it is the hardest of known substances, it can only be acted upon by itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>It is <q>&#x0022;diamond cut diamond.&#x0022;</q> The small diamonds and chips of larger ones are crushed to a fine powder, and this is strewn upon iron wheels, greased to retain it, while the diamond, fastened in a leaden socket, is held until <num value="1">one</num> facet after another is ground and polished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>With a thin, smooth saw of iron, covered with dust, the diamond may also be sawn in <num value="2">two</num>, or slabs may be taken off, so as to bring it into the required shapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>These slabs are also cut to form other jewels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>Of so precious a commodity nothing is lost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/> The cost of cutting is very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Some years ago the <name>Shah</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7000231" n="1.000 27" reg="iran">Persia</placeName> came into possession of a large flat diamond, which has been supposed to be slab from the famous Koh inoor, or Mountain of Light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>The only account of its history that could be gathered was that it had been found by a poor man in Klorassan, and had been used by him, for a long time, instead of a flint, to strike fire with from a piece of steel, in which rough service it had sustained considerable injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/> The <unclear>R J</unclear>of Maintan, in Borcero, is the owner of rather a nice diamond, which he will not sell at any price; firstly, because it is believed to be lucky to his family, in which it has been for a long period; and, secondly, on account of its medical virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>This water is distributed among the people, and cures many diseases.
