<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Allow me, General, to add a few words on the merits of the proposed alteration.--Under the present act of Congress, the proportions of the flag are incorrect, the length being double the width; which is against all rule, and a flag so made will not float.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The <num value="1">one</num> now used over the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName> is not according to law; but it is correctly proportioned, having the width <num value="2">two</num>- <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>So that the proportions, at least, will have to be changed, and while under amendment, it is proposed to improve the field of the flag also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It has been ascertained by practical use in the army and navy that our flag is very easily soiled from its excessive whiteness, and it is especially liable to this objection on steam vessels, which are rapidly superseding all other ships of war. The portion of the flag proposed to be changed to a red bar is the part, too, most readily defaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It is strongly urged by naval officers of high standing that our flag is liable to be mistaken for a flag of truce, particularly in a calm, when it hangs dead against the mast, and the union is obscured by the white bunting.--When seen at a distance, flags are generally displayed against the white clouds beyond, and hence want of distinctness is a great defect in the present flag, the union being the only portion seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Besides these capital objections to it, the flag is so <hi rend="italics">tame looking</hi> that it excites no emotion in the hearts of our people, and looks more like a white table-cloth, with a colored patch in <num value="1">one</num> corner, than the ensign of a great nation, such as ours is destined to be. Consequently we have not become attached to it as we should have done by this time had the colors been more striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It was hurriedly adopted, at the very close of a session of the last Congress, as the best they could do under the multiplicity of plans submitted, and when the contest really was whether the battle-flag should form part of it. See accompanying letter from <persName n="Boteler,Colonel,A.,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="default:Boteler,A.,R.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Boteler</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Chairman">Chairman</rs> of the <rs>Committee</rs> on Flag and Sea', of last Congress, in favor of this amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>I respectfully submit that the bill before the <name>Senate</name> removes all the objections urged against the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>It gives it correctness of proportion, distinctness and character; renders it fit for practical use, and presents a beautiful standard, which, under no circumstances, can be mistaken for a flag of truce or the flag of any other nation on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It relieves the flag of its <hi rend="italics">pale-faced</hi> appearance, and makes it look more martial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The battle-flag, selected by <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, and recommended by himself and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and under which so much blood has been spilled in our struggle for independence, is fully displayed as the union in the proposed flag, which can only be done by surrounding it with white, and the red bar, forming the outer half of the field from the union, is suggested as the best design for its improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>I am opposed to all stripes, many or few, <rs type="color">red</rs> or <rs type="color">blue</rs>; for, besides the resemblance, they would make our flag answer to the common description of the now degraded badge of the basest of tyrannies-- &#x0022;the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> The colors of the new flag would be chiefly <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs>, with as little as possible of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> blue.</hi> The heraldic significance of these colors is deemed especially appropriate for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>--the white (argent) being emblematic of purity and innocence, and the red (gules) of fortitude and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>In the adoption of ensigns by the principal nations of the world, it is noticed by <persName n="Hamilton,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, in his History of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Flag, that they generally imitate the ensigns of the nations from which they sprung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>This rule is complied with in the flag, as proposed, for our people are chiefly descended from the <rs>British</rs> and <rs>French</rs>, and we get the union and the cross of St. Andrew from the former, and the red bar from the flag of the latter nation, while the idea of having stars to represent the <name>States</name> respectively is taken from the flag of the old Union, mainly founded by our fore-fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The new flag is easily made, and is without the complication of any painting, which, besides the difficulty of correct execution, soon rots the bunting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The proportions, while most pleasing to the eye, possess the virtue of simplicity &mdash; the white below and on side of the union being same width as the red bar. They have been approved by some of the bests artists in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and, after careful examination, have been pronounced correct by some of the most experienced officers of the navy.--such as <persName n="Forrest,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,Captain,S.,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="default:Lee,S.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Mason,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Parker,Captain,W.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="default:Parker,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, the latter being at the head of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <orgName n="Naval Academy" type="academy">Naval Academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>To Arm and Equip and Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Those who think to retain arms for their own defence should remember that if the army cannot protect them the arms will be of little use.--While no valid title can be acquired to public arms and equipments, except from the <rs>Government</rs>, it is reported that many persons have ignorantly purchased them from private parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made, to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>All these officers are requested, and those connected with this army are directed, to receive and receipt for all arms and equipments, whatever their condition, and forward the same, with a duplicate receipt, to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and report their proceedings to these headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The person holding the receipt will be compensated upon presenting it to the <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>. </p>
