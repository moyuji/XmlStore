<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> About <time value="3:30oclock">half-past 3 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> afternoon the operator at the <rs type="place">Central Depot</rs> discovered, by the constant interruption of the working of the telegraph, that the enemy had cut the wire and put in an instrument, with a view to intercept messages over the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The operator at <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName> was immediately ordered to put on his ground wire, thus cutting the line west of that point out of the circuit, and preventing any message from passing over the line from this end beyond that station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Soon after this was done an operator called the office at this end, and inquired what was the signal by which the office at <placeName reg="Hanover Court-House">Hanover Court-House</placeName> was known, and receiving no satisfactory answer, he inquired where <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was.

From the style of writing the operator at this office was satisfied that the party making the inquiries was a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and desired information in regard to the position of our forces, and whatever else he could get that might be of service to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>His name was again asked for, when he replied that our operator was very anxious to ascertain who and where he was. As the down train passed <placeName reg="Frederick's Hall station">Frederick's Hall station</placeName> the enemy were reported to be within a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of that place, and the presumption is that they followed the train below <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName>, and put in the instrument between the <rs type="place">Dam and Hanover Junction</rs>. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> <persName n="West,Captain,Beckwith,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:West,Beckwith,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Beckwith</foreName> <surname>West</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="48VARegiment">48th Virginia regiment</orgName>, was captured by the enemy at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName>, on <date value="05-30">the 30th of May,</date> and taken to Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, where he was held as prisoner until exchanged a few days ago. In a narration of his prison experiences he says that the <rs>Confederate</rs> commissioned officers, <num value="47">forty-seven</num> in number, were confined in a room <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> long by <num value="15">fifteen</num> in width, the ascent to which was made by a ladder <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> long, which was taken away every night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>On some days, as the caprice of the commanding officer happened to be, the officers were permitted to walk for half an hour on the parapet of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Officers and privates were subjected to the same fare, which consisted of a small allowance of sour bread and salt meat twice a day, with an occasional introduction of very weak soup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The Government allowance for rations purports to be <measure n="16cents" type="currency">sixteen cents</measure> a day for each prisoner; but it was stated in a Philadelphia newspaper that <persName n="Gibson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Gibson</surname></persName>, by <q>&#x0022;his excellent management,&#x0022;</q> saved about <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of this sum, and expended it in clothing, which the prisoners never received the benefit of. Letters were occasionally sent them, by stealth, from sympathizing friends in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and New York, conveying the intelligence that presents had been forwarded to them, but they never reached their destination, being intercepted on the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Until the exchange of prisoners was agreed upon they were not allowed to receive newspapers; but whenever the commandant of the fort found anything especially adverse to the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, he would cut it out and send it to the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers for the purpose of irritating them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In consequence of an impression that the prisoners were forming a plan to take possession of the fort, an attempt was made to conciliate them with information that they were about to be paroled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Of the <measure n="4000" type="prisoners">4,000 prisoners</measure> there, some <num value="3000">3,000</num> were kept in little pens, which our informant describes as <q>&#x0022;sheep pens,&#x0022;</q> and subjected to much suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><persName n="Segebarth,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Segebarth,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Segebarth</surname></persName>, the officer in command, treated them with great brutality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>No communication was allowed between the officers and privates, except by special permission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Every inducement was offered privates to take the oath of allegiance and enlist in the <rs>Federal</rs> army; and it was not uncommon for the officers to propose a bribe of from <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure> to <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> in gold to effect his purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Thus <num value="271">271</num> were induced to take the oath, but of this number not <num value="1">one</num> was a native of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>These men were afterwards placed in tents outside of the walls; and as they returned for their blankets and clothing, some of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers cursed them for their treason, whereupon the <rs>Sergeant</rs> of the guard fired a pistol at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Bricks and other missiles were then thrown indiscriminately, and the whole garrison was in an uproar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Cannon were placed in position to bear upon the <measure n=".25" type="prisoners">prisoners quarters</measure>, and various measures resorted to for the purpose of intimidation, but the worst frightened man in the fort was the valorous <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, Segebarth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The privateersmen were kept in camp in a low, marshy place, and <num value="1">one</num> night some of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers, to increase their sufferings, turned the water in upon them and completely overflowed their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>They were compelled to sleep in mud and water a considerable portion of the time, and the consequence was that several died. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> <persName n="Hall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hall</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3FLRegiment">3d Florida regiment</orgName>, who was arrested on <placeName key="tgn,1129377" n="1.000 3" reg="saint johns, florida, united states">St. John's river</placeName> on <date value="04-27">the 27th of April,</date> arrived in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> yesterday from Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Though a private soldier, he was charged with being the captain of a guerrilla company, and treated worse than if he had been a pirate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>For <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> he was kept on board a gunboat in irons, while a man stood over him with a sabre bayonet and pistol, with orders to kill him if he attempted to move from his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>He was subsequently sent to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and marched in irons through the streets of that city and New York, then sent to <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>, but soon transferred to Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, where his irons were removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He was treated with some kindness by the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>, who was formerly employed by him in the coasting trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>His general experience of prison life is similar to that of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>On reaching <placeName reg="Alken's Landing">Alken's Landing</placeName>, on his return, <persName n="Hall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hall</surname></persName> was designated as a captain by the <rs>Federal</rs>, who insisted that he should be exchanged as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This he would not consent to, and so firm was he in his determination to be exchanged as a private, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, in their wrath, endeavored to detain him, but were finally compelled to yield. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> All the prisoners form Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> are indignant at the treatment they received, and their purpose is to <q>&#x0022;square accounts&#x0022;</q> with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> if the opportunity is ever afforded them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> Among the exchanged prisoners from Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> who have arrived here is <persName n="McMurran,,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:McMurran,Joseph,,,"><foreName n="Joseph">Jos.</foreName> <surname>McMurran</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="4VARegiment">4th Virginia regiment</orgName>, captured at <placeName key="tgn,7017708" n="1.000 36" reg="winchester, winchester, virginia">Kernstown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He agrees with his companions that the treatment of Confederate soldiers was brutal in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The officers and soldiers in immediate contact with the prisoners were <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>, and their brutality to our men was without mitigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In return, our men say that there won't be any more <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> Dutchmen taken prisoners by them during this war. Striking a prisoner over the head or running a bayonet at him was a common occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>, named Segebarth, excelled his brother brutes in maltreating the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>A dungeon, made to accommodate <num value="3">three</num> men, often contained <num value="14">fourteen</num>, and their sufferings were very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The fare was bread and a very small piece of salt pork twice a day, and bean soup of about the consistency of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Nearly <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the men had scurvy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The general determination of the exchanged prisoners is to be shot before they will again be taken and undergo the miseries of a Northern prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Just before the prisoners left Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> the following order from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> was read: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Notwithstanding these precautions, though communication with him by the other prisoners was strictly forbidden, they contrived, by tying notes to nails and throwing them in the window, to hear from him; but the fact be coming known to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commandant of the prison, he marched <persName n="Zarvona,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Zarvona,nomatch:0"><surname>Zarvona</surname></persName> to the guard-house, dressed <num value="1">one</num> of his own <rs type="role2">Sergeants</rs> in the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s habiliments, and placed him at the window to receive the notes intended for him.
