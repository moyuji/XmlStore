<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Affairs here look unpleasantly blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The enemy are doubtless besieging <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>, and with the fall of that stronghold the fate of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> is likewise decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Yet there seems to be no excitement, no panic, no alarm such as has been experienced in every other city threatened with Federal occupation, and the people are grimly awaiting their doom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The fall of <placeName key="tgn,2031620" n="1.000 10" reg="Donaldson, Marshall, Indiana">Donelson</placeName> and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> has made them callous, and not until the volcano has yawned beneath their feet will they be aroused to the critical character of their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is not to be inferred from these remarks that the <name>Tennesseeans</name> are not loyal to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>On the contrary, no hearts are warmer or truer in the devotion to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><num value="60">Sixty</num> companies have gone from the little city already, and to day even the old men are in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But there are large domestic interests at stake. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Much valuable private property is in the balance, and as long as the <rs>Federal</rs> respect this, the owners reason that it is better to remain and protect it than to remove with their families from the <rs>State</rs> and give up all to <q>&#x0022;<num value="1">one</num> fell blow&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> A <num value="1000">thousand</num> absurd rumors are in circulation concerning the threatened advance of the enemy; and it is conceded that, with their iron plated gunboats, they can at any time pass <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> and descend to <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><num value="1">One</num> of these statements is that word has been sent here to the effect that if the stores of sugar and cotton are burned, the city will be also burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Another is that the <rs>Federal</rs>, if permitted to occupy <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, will make no further demonstrations, and so on. All of these are, of course, pure fabrications, <q>&#x0022;full of round and fury, and signifying nothing.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Troops escaped from <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island no.10</placeName> still continue to arrive here, and bring exciting accounts of their adventures by the way.--Some of them waded for miles up to their armpits in water; some have been drowned and last, and all the survivors are thoroughly worn down and exhausted by their terrible journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The names of some of the officers captured are: <persName n="Henderson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Henderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Henderson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Avery,Lieutenant-Colonel,T.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Avery,T.,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> A <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon">Surgeon</rs> of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Alabama</rs> regiments, who remained until <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, and then made his escape in the disguise of a farmer, informed me that he had a long in review with <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> and <persName n="Payne,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Payne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Payne</surname></persName>, in the course of which the former stated that he should be in <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> within <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> He said also that he could have taken I and <num value="10">No. 10</num> several days before, but that the retarded the bombardment for the purpose of prolonging the contest, and thereby preventing reinforcements from being sent to <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The force of the <rs>Federal</rs> now on the <rs type="place">New Madrid peninsula</rs> is <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> troops, consisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Our guns on the island were being unspiked, but the <rs>Federal Genera</rs>'s claim they have no use for them, as they have guns enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The shells thrown by the enemy in many instances weighed <measure n="234l." type="pounds"><num value="234">two hundred and thirty-four</num> pounds</measure>. Upwards of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> missiles were fired at us during the bombardment, the entire result of which was <num value="1">one</num> man killed and a few slightly wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The gallant <persName n="Rucker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Rucker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Rucker</surname></persName> is safe in this city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> As soon as the <rs>Federal</rs> army lauded, they commenced investigations as to the loyalty of the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>All who were suspected of secession proclivities were immediately arrested, and their property given up to the soldiers, by whom it was either appropriated or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>All others were kindly treated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Northern accounts of the recent tactics of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> have been received here from both <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The Federal there in acknowledge a total defeat on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and a drawn battle on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, with a loss of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> to them and <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> to us. They confess also to a demoralization of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, and that a long time may possibly elapse before another fight can take peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> Our Federal prisoners when here made similar statements, and <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Prentiss,nomatch:0"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> himself said that had he attack been followed up on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, we might have captured the entire force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Nature, however, conspired against such a movement, and <sic>and</sic> we were obliged to forego the evident advantages which would have accrued from the demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>There prisoners were all in the best of spirits, shouting and yelling with perfect delight, as if they revelled in the idea of exchanging their Northern servitude for a Southern prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Many of them were from <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and the general sentiment expressed was that if the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> attempted to carry out the scheme of emancipation that had been pronounced, at lease <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the <rs>Western</rs> men would lay down their arms and refuse to serve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They contended that they were fighting to restore the <rs>Union</rs>, and not to subjugate our people or overthrow their institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Some of the <rs>Federal</rs> carried pikes, such as have been adopted in the <rs>Southern</rs> army; but in the heavy growth of small woods which covered the field, they were found to be utterly useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Until of late, contrary to the general belief, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army has not been well supplied with effective arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They have used the old guns that have lain in the <rs>London Tower</rs> since <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>; but now they say they are fully equipped in this respect, and irresistible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Previous to the fight on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> many of our men were anxious to hoist the black flag and make it a desperate day's work, but they were restrained by the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>As it was, several took off their red shirts, and fought under them as sanguinary representatives of the battle-flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> Great surprise was manifested by the prisoners at the number of boys and small men in our army, and <num value="1">one</num> of them remarked that, <q>&#x0022;for little fellers, they fought like the d--<num value="1">1</num>.&#x0022;</q> Somebody asked him what he thought of the battle generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><q>&#x0022;Well,&#x0022;</q> said he, <q>&#x0022;if you'd stuck to us <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> more <persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> might have called his roll in h--<num value="11">11</num>, and he wouldn't have found <num value="1">one</num> of us missing.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> Speaking of boys, it is not less true than remarkable that a large proportion of the army is composed of such material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>And they make the best soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They fight with <hi rend="italics">vim</hi> and daring, and, what is better still, never know when they are whipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/><num value="1">One</num> young <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> lad of <num value="15">fifteen</num>, whom I remember, fought all day in advance of his regiment, and never retreated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Taking his position behind <unclear></unclear> and creeping from bush to bush he kept up a steady fire from his rifle, until he had expended <num value="40">forty</num> cartridges, and then robbed the body of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> for a fresh supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>His clothes were absolutely cut to pieces, and yet, with the exception of a slight scratch on the arm, he escaped without a wound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> <persName n="Smith,Colonel,Preston,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Smith,Preston,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Preston</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, who fought so gallantly at the head of the -- <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> regiment, has been brevetted a Brigadier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Other promotions were made on the field by <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>; and there has been, so it is said, a system of advancement adopted whereby the humblest soldier may, by meritorious conduct, rise from the ranks to the highest offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>This is as it should be. Promotion made the <rs>French</rs> army, gave <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> half his strength and successes, and the sooner the rule is applied here the letter it will be for the common cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> The wounded are generally doing well.--Several <num value="100">hundred</num> are in the hospital here under the best of medical care, and attended by the ladies of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Have they not reached an eminence of mendacity that is absolutely stupendous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>They claim a victory, and celebrate it by firing <num value="100">one hundred</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>They assert that we lost from <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure> to <num value="40000">40,000</num>--or, in other words, that our entire army was annihilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> We can afford to laugh at these weak inventions of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They are intended to throw dust in the eyes of the gullible populace, who will probably never see the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Such fabrications are strictly in keeping with the <rs>Federal</rs> policy, which is never to acknowledge a reverse, if it can be possibly conceated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>According to these precious chroniclers, they have lost no battle since the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>After proceeding some distance, they learned that the enemy camped on the <rs type="place">Laurel Fork</rs> of Tug the night before they started in pursuit of them, and had from that point already commenced retracting their steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The telegraph tells this morning the most deplorable tale ever heard in <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>, or, we believe, in the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/><num value="2">Two</num> contemptible little steamers have come up to the great city of <placeName reg="New Orleans, Orleans, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014214">New Orleans</placeName> &mdash; inhabited by a population of <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> souls, defended by miles upon miles of columbiads and rifled cannon, possessing <num value="6">six</num> <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName> of <unclear> mense</unclear> power, containing within her bosom not less than <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> disciplined troops &mdash; and have commanded the authorities to haul down the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>As we write, there had been no intelligence of its having been hauled down, but we are prepared to expect the worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Sailing through miles of the heaviest artillery, it does not appear that so much as a single shot was fired at these <num value="2">two</num> little steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>On the contrary, every thing seems to have been prepared beforehand for their quiet reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The troops were immediately withdrawn lest they might feel disposed to demur, all the defences on the lake were dismantled, the guns were thrown down without being injured, the steamboats, that could have gotten up steam in an hour and been off, were burned, and the defenders were drawn off to a distant point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> Never since the world began was there such a transaction &mdash; so dark, so mysterious, so altogether unaccountable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> The telegraph, thus far, gives a very confused account of this most <sic>mysterous</sic> and most deplorable affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Terrible suspicious are afloat, but we hold it best not to give voice to them until something more definite shall have reached us. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> From extracts heretofore transferred to this paper from Northern journals it will be seen that the <rs>Northern</rs> press, or rather, the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> portion of it, are raising a terrific howl over the short-comings of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>He has never been denounced, ridiculed, and, we may add, vilified, by the <rs>Southern</rs> press, as he is by those very journals, which but yesterday made him a demigod and to-day are shrieking for his destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It was easy to see that this would be so from the start.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>When <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Robert,G.,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> was installed at the head of the <rs>Grand Army</rs> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, he was the object of more idolatry than any <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> since the days of <unclear>H enan,</unclear> but the moment that the <rs>Grand Army</rs> took to its heels at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Robert,G.,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> was doomed and denounced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>All at once <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> became a young <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>His star rushed up in an hour from an obscure fight in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, to the meridian of the heavens, but its rush was too much of the meteor to promise a steady and abiding place in the heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>We felt as satisfied then as we feel now, that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> would not retain his popularity any longer than <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Robert,G.,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>There were various reasons for such a belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>In the first place, and without prejudice against him as an enemy, we are not aware of his having given any proof of ability to maintain a military situation as difficult as that which was presented for his solution, and which had proved too much for the abilities and experience, not only of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Robert,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, but of the best counsel and advice which he could gather around him of the old officers of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Again, we have never heard of popularity, based upon what was expected of a man, instead of what he had performed, that amounted to much or lasted long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Another potent objection to the permanence of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s power was the fact that he is a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Nothing but the most immediate and brilliant successes, the most Napoleonic achievements, could alone for that crime with the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> mob. They will never be satisfied without a thorough blackguard at their head, and at this moment would sacrifice their chances of success under an accomplished and regular officer for their chances of vengeance under some such brute as <persName n="Wade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Wade,Banks,,,:1"><surname>Wade</surname></persName>, of the <name>Senate</name>, who knows nothing of military matters, but is brutal and devilish to the high water-mark of abolition malevolence and bloodthirstiness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> We shall not be surprised, therefore, if <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> should come down as fast as he has gone up, unless he hastens to demolish the stronghold of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>We feel no disposition to detract from his real abilities.--Whilst he himself cannot but smile at the exaggerated praises still heaped-upon him by some friendly journals, it would be idle to deny that he is a man of abilities, who, fortunately for us, and unfortunately for himself, has been pitted against his superior in the art of war, <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> strategists on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>But <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is comparatively a young man, and before he has finished his studies under <q>&#x0022;Old Joe,&#x0022;</q> will learn a good many things that are not laid down in the books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>We will say this for him, he has done as much as any man in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> army could have done in his situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>If he or any other man had undertaken to advance upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in the manner and form prescribed by the warlike journalists of the <rs>North</rs>, there would have been scenes enacted compared with which <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was child's play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may not under stand it now, but <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has saved their bacon by not fighting battles, and they cannot regret his failure to advance more than the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> The difficulty of the situation is not in the <rs>Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Such <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> as <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wool,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Wool,nomatch:0"><surname>Wool</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, and other Federal <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> who might be named, are foemen worthy of Southern steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>But there are insuperable obstacles to any considerable advance into the <rs>Southern</rs> country, except where it is intersected by rivers navigable by gunboats, which no military genius in the <rs>North</rs> can overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It is due to the officers of the old regulars that a distinction should be made between them and the volunteer <rs type="role" reg="General">Generals</rs> of the enemy, who are in general entitled to no degree of respect whatever as soldiers, and not often as gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/><q>&#x0022;The General who is not a soldier,&#x0022;</q> said the great <rs>Napoleon</rs>, <q>&#x0022;is a monkey.&#x0022;</q> That pithy and scornful remark expresses all we could desire to say of the whole tribe of pretenders in epaulets, who are <q>&#x0022;playing such fantastic tricks before high Heaven as might make angels weep.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>Fortify the river.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> At the risk of being considered alarmists, we shall never cease to invoke the military and civil authorities of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to avail themselves of the uniform experience of this war, which is that no city can be considered safe which is exposed to an attack of the enemy's gunboats, and has not adopted the most thorough and complete system of defence against such attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>New Orleans, a city of <num value="5">five</num> times the population and wealth of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, has added another and disastrous illustration of the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>And yet, it seems as if some stupefying draught had been drained to the dregs by those having this matter in hand, or that what is everybody's business being nobody's business, the public had determined to content themselves with an expression of amusement at the apathy of the authorities, and resign themselves to their fate as to a thing that is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It is useless to talk of creating fortifications on a river, when places of such strength as <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName>, and the other defences of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, are easily evaded by these powerful vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It is perfectly practicable so to obstruct and defend the channels as to keep the enemy from </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> ascending the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>But these obstructions must not be of the ordinary character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>What has been done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>What is doing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Is it proposed to rely upon the single strand of the <rs>Virginia</rs>, which any accident may destroy and which, at best, will be neutralized in a few weeks by a dozen <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vessels of a similar class?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Our authorities ought to act as if there were no such vessels as the <rs>Virginia</rs> in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We call the attention of the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">City Council of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></orgName> to this subject, and especially of those members of this body who are practical business men, and have some brains, and know enough of arithmetic to calculate the effect upon the city finances a Federal ascent of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>They did not wait for authentic data to be published, but gobbled down at once the gross fabrication that the <rs>Monitor</rs> drew the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blood in the combat with the <rs>Virginia</rs>, and compelled her to haul off and make the best of her way to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Now, it is impossible for the <rs>English</rs> journalists to know better, because all their sources of information are Northern, and to <q>&#x0022;lie like a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper&#x0022;</q> is now a more expressive phrase than to <q>&#x0022;lie like a bulletin.&#x0022;</q> They have not heard the <rs>Southern</rs> side of the story, and, we fear, are not likely to hear it. The truth is, as we hear it from Southern gentlemen having access to the best means of information, that it was the <rs>Monitor</rs> and not the <rs>Virginia</rs> that retreated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The Monitor did not draw the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blood, nor any blood at all, and she has since that period been defied to combat by the <rs>Virginia</rs> over and over again, but has declined the challenge, and kept cautiously under the shelter of the guns of <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> Moreover, before urging an entire revolution in the fortifications of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, it would be well to wait a little and see what are the sea going qualities of iron-cased vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Our own opinion is, that neither Monitors nor <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, would be of much account in a heavy sea and a high wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We think it would be safer to be in either of them when pounding each other, than when exposed to the batteries of old Ocean.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> If there is any <num value="1">one</num> general aspect distinct from all others observable in these armies of Western men, it is that of indomitable daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Take either the individual or the mass, and you find the spirit of resistance peeping from every line and angle of the human face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>I had thought, when in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, that the <hi rend="italics">physiques</hi> of the troops there, gathered as they were from every section of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, could not be excelled on the habitable globe; but that opinion is countered by the spectacle presented here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>And I make the assertion without hazard of contradiction, that nowhere can be found a more splendid looking, hardy, courageous, high-strung body of soldiers, than are to be seen in this <orgName n="Army of Mississippi" type="army">Army of the Mississippi</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The troops from <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> are small, wiry, muscular, quick as squirrels in their motions, and thoroughly Gallied in their habits and associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The men of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> are taller, as a general thing less cosmopolized, yet full of Southern fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Between all of these I have named, however, and the soldiers of the <rs>West</rs>--from <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>--the distinction is broad, well marked, and observable at a glance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Something in the independent, swaggering air &mdash; a sort of don't cars-adamitiveness &mdash; which the latter carry about them in every relation of <unclear></unclear>, bespeaks at a glance their wild and ragged ancestry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Even this is apparent in the attire of the respective people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The Southerners wear an approximation to a uniform, but these Western men present external features so homogeneous, original and miscellaneous, that <orgName n="Vanity Fair" type="magazine">Vanity Fair</orgName> itself could not hold a candle to the spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Here you see the well dressed gentleman with nothing to mark the soldier but the cartridge box, body belt and shot gun. There is a group of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> boatmen in their slouched hats, red shirts, heavy pants, and cowhide boots, coming up to the knee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Again, you encounter the bush whackers of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, large bearded, hard handed, tough, muscular fellows, who eat victuals with their <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs>, and sleep on the butts of their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Some have rifles which have come down to them as heir-looms from an untainted ancestry, and are historic with the bloody records of <q>&#x0022;bar&#x0022;</q> fights and wild cat adventures, <num value="1000">thousands</num> have nothing but the ordinary shot gun, but all, more or less, go armed with the inevitable knife and revolver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Many ride poor Rosinantes of beasts, sometimes a horse, but as frequently a mule, and thus equipped, go forth, looking like dilapidated <persName n="Quixotes,,Don,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="default:Quixotes,Don,,,"><foreName>Don</foreName> <surname>Quixotes</surname></persName>, but acting like very devils when they smell blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Fear is no part of their composition, and the thickest of the fray is sure to find them in it, dealing death and destruction with an impartial hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> It is obviously impossible to describe all this peculiar <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">olla podrida</hi></foreign> of humanity; but if you will imagine an army, every man's dress in which, except that of the officers, is different, betokening more or less in its general characteristics the <rs>State</rs> from which he is &mdash; in other words, make to yourself an arabesque pattern of the most irregular looking cohorts that ever assembled upon a tented field, and you may possibly be able to enjoy a mental view of the picture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> Such men cannot be disciplined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>There is too much of native born independence about them to submit to the rigid restraints of military life, and though the officers are, in the main, big enough (for most of them seem to have been selected on account of their size and prowess) to whip any <num value="1">one</num> in their command, they prefer to let the men have their own way and be satisfied with the common rudiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Consequently, in several of these aboriginal regiments, the only orders given during the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs> were, <q>&#x0022;Forward boys!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>charge 'em like--.&#x0022;</q> And the boys charged &mdash; pell-mell, helter-skelter, whooping, hurrahing, screaming, and screeching, the crowd would dash on, clear everything before them, and wait for the next move on the programme. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> As I have intimated in previous letters, the character of the ground at <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, was such as to favor precisely the style of fighting to which these men were best adapted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They were accustomed to creeping through bushes, dodging behind trees, and taking dead sight at will along their long barrels, and this accounts for the terrible execution suffered by the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> While on this subject I cannot for bear from alluding to the importance of an organized corps of sharp-shooters, and we have the best material for the purpose in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The enemy have set the example, and we know its results to our profound regret in the loss of the gallant <rs>Johnston</rs>, <persName n="McCulloch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:McCulloch,nomatch:0"><surname>McCulloch</surname></persName>, <persName n="McIntosh,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:McIntosh,nomatch:0"><surname>McIntosh</surname></persName>, and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>These sharp-shooters during a battle do nothing but pick off the leading officers, and panic once produced by the fall of these, the day is won. A party of the <orgName type="mil" key="TexanRangers">Texan Rangers</orgName>, during the late fight, dismounted and with their rifles crept forward in squads, and did murderous work upon the enemy by cutting down their best men. It is by <num value="1">one</num> of these that <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> is said to have been severally wounded if not killed as either he or some other distinguished officer was seen to fall from his horse to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The subject is <num value="1">one</num> worthy of consideration, and it is to be hoped that some measures will be taken to perfect this important arm of the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> In a foregoing letter, I alluded to the sentiment in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Illinois</placeName> as being wholly averse to the policy adopted by the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We have in <num value="1">one</num> of the hospitals here a gallant young fellow from that section, who raised a company there, brought them to <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, engaged in the battle, and fell desperately wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The <rs>Surgeon</rs> told him that amputation must be performed or he would die. <q>&#x0022;<rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>,&#x0022;</q> said the brave fellow, save that leg if you can, if for no other purpose than <num value="1">one</num>--to enable me to fight the abolitionists again.&#x0022; The physician told him it was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/><q>&#x0022;Then,&#x0022;</q> continued he, <q>&#x0022;cut it so I can wear a dork leg, and I'll fight 'em on horseback.&#x0022;</q> The <rs>Surgeon</rs> told him he would secure a handsome artificial leg for him. <q>&#x0022;All right then &mdash; go ahead;&#x0022;</q> and lighting a pipe, he sat through the operation, smoking and watching, without uttering a groan. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> Speaking of amputation, reminds me of another similar incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>A lad of <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="16">sixteen</num> was so badly wounded that his leg had to be taken off. When he had recovered from the effects of the chloroform, he was asked how he felt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/><q>&#x0022;Feel,&#x0022;</q> said he, <q>&#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>That old leg has bothered me ever since I was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I've had it broken twice, and laid in bed <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> with a sprained knee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Its been a d &mdash; d unlucky leg, anyhow; but now I'll have a wooden <num value="1">one</num>, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may shoot at that all day.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> Of news, there is none stirring which it would be prudent to make public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>At best, <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> is a perfect nest of rumors, and every day those susceptible of these truant impressions are thrown into fever heat by <num value="1">one</num> or more of frivolous canards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The latest is by way of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and reports that <sic>that</sic> city is in possession of a portion of the troops under <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, while the balance went to <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName>, surrounded the town, and has taken <measure n="7000" type="prisoners">seven thousand prisoners</measure>! <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> is also reported to have died of his wounds! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> Affairs at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> remain unchanged.--<persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> has again got his army in splendid fighting condition, and we are ready for another attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> Opinion is divided, however, upon the probability of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> effort being made by the <rs>Federal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The favorite impression is, that they were emphatically disgusted with their reception, and will turn their backs upon the inhospitable place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>A large portion of the transports and gunboats have, it is said, already gone down the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>; but whether it is to convey troops away, or bring reinforcements hither, nobody knows. </p>

<head><orgName n="New Mexican" type="newspaper">New Mexican</orgName> Affairs.<lb/>[from the <orgName n="Houston Telegraph" type="newspaper">Houston Telegraph</orgName>.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/> The condition of things in <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> appears to be somewhat misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>While it is not to be doubted that our brave Texans have got military possession of every important point in the country, including as it is presumed, <placeName reg="Santa Fe, Santa Fe, New Mexico" key="tgn,7013950">Santa Fe</placeName>, yet the accounts we have are that they have no <orgName n="New Mexican" type="newspaper">New Mexican</orgName> volunteers to help them, while the <rs>Federal</rs> seem to have <num value="1000">thousands</num> enlisted on their side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> In the mere matter of military possession, this fact of course counts for but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Our irresistible phalanxes have never, since the days of <placeName reg="San Jacinto, Jennings, Indiana" key="tgn,2033587">San Jacinto</placeName>, hesitated to attack <num value="5">five</num> times the number of the enervated race that inhabits that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>But when we consider that a military possession of an unfriendly people, even though that people may be wanting in energy, is at present rather of an expensive pleasure, the question may arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>What is the use?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>And to this question we have an answer to suggest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> The war now going on is the great war between pro-slavery and anti-slavery ideas of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Its main battles are being fought an our Northern border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>The contest has but lately culminated into a war, though the conflict of ideas has existed for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. On the <num value="1">one</num> hand have the institutions of the <rs>South</rs> maintained their position while on the other they have been assaulted by all the means a most ingenious race could devise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>Prominent among the schemes of our enemies has been to surround us with <q>&#x0022;a cordon of free territory and let slavery sting itself to death.&#x0022;</q> And to combat this move the civil war in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> was carried on, which was but the precursor to the great war now existing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/> Suppose, now, we succeed in beating back our invader, and force him to acknowledge our independence after a long and desperate struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>That simply done leaves us, with reference to this <q>&#x0022;cordon&#x0022;</q> matter, just where we were before, and with the ground in his possession to carry out the scheme, as well as the revenge ranking in his heart to rush him to superhuman exertions to accomplish his object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Our independence, to be sure, is gained, but in such a way as to leave us still at the mercy of our foe. Our territory would be our own, but by far too limited in extend for the success of our social system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>We should be surrounded by people whose every interest would be advanced by our injury. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/> It was to prevent this that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00341" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Hector,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> set on foot the move he did for the conquest of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>, and entrusted it to <persName n="Sibley,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00342" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sibley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>We do not presume that either <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00343" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Hector,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> or <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,nomatch:0"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> looked to see our armies welcomed by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>If they could produce a favorable impression, it was to be desired; but whether they could or not, the conquest must be made or our liberties would be but half won with our independence acknowledged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/> Nor is this all. The conquest of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> opens the way to that portion of the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs> that affiliates with us in sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>It is the entering wedge to the breaking off from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of all of that coast we desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>It also is the opening scene of our manifest destiny. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> Let us, then, hear less of the <q>&#x0022;extravagance of sending an army a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> to conquer a country not worth fighting for&#x0022;</q> Let us hope that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00345" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,nomatch:0"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> will be fully supported, and that the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag will be not only planted, but most firmly supported, in the region of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
