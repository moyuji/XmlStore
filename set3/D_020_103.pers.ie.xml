<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">Is the <name>Czar</name> our friend or enemy?</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> --Not long ago, the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, through his prime minister, <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Gortschakoff</foreName></persName>, addressed a letter to <persName n="Stoeckle,Baron,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stoeckle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Baron">Baron</roleName> <surname>Stoeckle</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to be read to the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, abounding in friendly expressions: but marked throughout by the most careful non-committalism as to the quarrel raging on this continent between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>To a plain person uninitiated in the mysteries of diplomacy, it seemed to be a letter intended, while expressing the autocrat's regard and friendship for all <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, to announce his entire neutrality in the war of the sections; to assign to his <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> minister his position in respect to the belligerents, and to announce to the <rs>Washington Government</rs> the policy he would pursue in respect to either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Other <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Governments had taken means to announce their neutrality;--<placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> by the proclamation of her <rs type="role" reg="Captain-General">Captain-General</rs> in <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>; <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> by the declarations of her ministers in Parliament; and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, by her official organ, and her proclaimed concurrence in the policy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The letter of the <name>Czar</name> in its language purported to be nothing more than a similar declaration on his part; in which, while announcing his policy of strict neutrality, and while carefully declining to express an opinion upon the issues of the sectional quarrel, he embraced the occasion to remind our country of the long friendship that had subsisted between the <num value="2">two</num> rising powers, and his unfeigned regret that the unity and greatness of our own country, so necessary to the equilibrium of power among the great nations of Christendom, should be lost by the separation of the <num value="2">two</num> sections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Such seemed to be the plain tenor and purport of the <rs>Autocrat</rs>'s letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It seemed to require no deep knowledge of or initiation into the mysteries of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> diplomacy to interpret it. It seemed to carry its meaning in its face, and was accepted by the <rs>South</rs> as creditable to the heart and head of its Imperial author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But it is claimed that the <rs>South</rs> has been deceived; that the <name>Czar</name> is not the plain-spoken, straightforward man that we conceived, and his letter indicated, him to be; that beneath all his benignity of language there was a strong undercurrent of sympathy with the <rs>North</rs>, and of repulsion towards the <rs>South</rs>; that we must infer his feelings towards our seceding States from his hereditary animosity towards rebellious <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>; and that his expressions of friendship for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were intended only for the <rs>Northern States</rs> that are about entering upon a grand enterprise for the liberation of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of slaves, such as he himself has just accomplished in the liberation of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of serfs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> At least such is the gloss which the <rs>North</rs> has given to the letter of the <name>Czar</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>That potentate, without reference to recent divisions, spoke of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; are not they the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He is profuse of expressions of sympathy and regard for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--that is to say, for the <rs>Northern States</rs>; is not this a stinging rebuke of <q>&#x0022;Secession?&#x0022;</q> He is strong in his expressions of regret over the dissensions existing between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>; is not the <rs>South</rs> the sole, unprovoked author, without provocation, cause, or excuse, of these dissensions, and the party indirectly, but most severely, condemned by the <name>Czar</name> on account of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>By this sort of self-complacent logic, they find a most favorable interpretation in their own behalf of the <rs>Emperor</rs>'s letter; and then they go to work to account for this most demonstrative sympathy for their cause and their section. </p> 
<p>

<head>Thinking of the soldiers.</head> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>We were sitting around the table </l><l>Just a night or <num value="2">two</num> ago, </l><l>In it's little cozy parlor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/></l><l>With the lamp light burning low-- </l><l>And the window blinds half opened, </l><l>For the summer air to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/></l><l>And the painted curtain moving, </l><l>Like a busy pendulum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/></l><l>O! the <unclear>p ions</unclear> on the sofa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/></l><l>And the pictures on the wall, </l><l>And the gathering of comforts, </l><l>In the old familiar hall-- </l><l>And the wagging of the pointer, </l><l>Lounging idly by the door, </l><l>And the flitting of the shadows </l><l>From the ceiling to the floor-- </l><l>O! they wakened in my spirit, </l><l>Like the beautiful in Art, </l><l>Such a busy, busy, thinking-- </l><l>Such a dreaminess of heart; </l><l>That I sat among the shadows </l><l>With my spirit all astray, </l><l>Thinking only &mdash; thinking only-- </l><l>Of the soldiers for away!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/></l><l>Of the tent beneath the moonlight, </l><l>Of the stirring rattoo's sound, </l><l>Of the soldier in his blanket, </l><l>In his blanket on the ground; </l><l>Of the icy winter coming, </l><l>Of the bleak, bleak winds that blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/></l><l>And the soldier in his blanket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/></l><l>In his blanket on the snow!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/></l><l>Of the slight upon the beather, </l><l>And the frost upon the hill, </l><l>And the whistling, whistling ever, </l><l>And the never <hi rend="italics">never still.</hi> </l><l>Of the little leaflets felling, </l><l>With the sweetest, saddest sound-- </l><l>And the soldier oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>the soldier, </l><l>In his blanket on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/></l><l>Thus I lingered in my dreaming, </l><l>In my dreaming far away, </l><l>Till the <unclear>spi It's</unclear> picture painting </l><l>Seemed as vivid as the day; </l><l>And the moonlight faded softly </l><l>From the window opened wide, </l><l>And the faithful, faithful pointer, </l><l>Nestled closer by my side; </l><l>And I know beneath the starlight, </l><l>Tho' the chilly frosts may fall, </l><l>That the soldier will be dreaming!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/></l><l>Dreaming often of us all. </l><l>So I give my spirit's painting, </l><l>Just the <hi rend="italics">heathing</hi> of a sound, </l><l>For the dreaming, dreaming soldier, </l><l>In his slumber on the ground!
