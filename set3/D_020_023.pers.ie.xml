It is, that the mortal remains of our late colleague, <persName n="Bartow,the Honorable,Francis,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Bartow,Francis,S.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Bartow</surname></persName>, now lie in the other end of this <name>Capitol</name>, temporarily made a charnel house for the illustrious dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I confess it is <num value="1">one</num> of the saddest duties I was ever called upon to perform I confess, moreover, my incompetency to perform it. To indulge in the formal generalities usual upon such occasions, would illy comport with your feelings or with mine.--To yield to the teachings of my own heart would, perhaps, be a sign as inappropriate to-day; for, sir, in every sense of the word he was my friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I believe I can say to-day, that as <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> loved <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> so loved he me. You all knew, and you all respected him.--You, sir, knew him intimately and long, and you loved him I knew him better than you did, and hence I loved him more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Pardon me the relation of a little incident that transpired but a day or <num value="2">two</num> before we left <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, and parted for the last time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It will illustrate better than any words I can speak, the intimacy of the relationship that existed between us. Sitting by my side all the while during the sessions of that Congress, never differing with me on any important question, occupying as he did the important position of <rs type="role" reg="Chairman">Chairman</rs> of the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName>, perhaps the most important position of any connected with our Congress, bringing before us many measures for our adoption which I always voted for with confidence, and with all the feeble powers I had aided him in carrying out, it is not surprising that our friendship grew and strengthened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It so happened, however, that on <num value="1">one</num> single point I differed with him and his committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Afterwards, as we left the <rs>Capitol</rs> and passed to our rooms, jestingly I made a remark to him. Instantly I perceived that it had wounded him, and as instantly I, with the frankness of a friend, begged he would never remember it. I supposed it had passed from his mind, but late in the evening, at a little social circle, where we had gathered together, he reminded you of the fact, that, during that day, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in our lives, I had wounded his feelings. --Still, again, I tried to remove the impression, and assure him of my unwavering friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We retired, but sleep would not come to my eyes, for my friend was wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Silently, and in small hours of the morning, I passed from my room to his; quietly opening the door, I called his name, and found that he, too, had been sleepless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Without a word of explanation, I went in the darkness to his bedside and leaned over him. He locked me in his embrace, and, shall I say it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>we wept without a word; and I retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Such, sir, was my friendship &mdash; such, his. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> My friend, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, was born on the <dateStruct value="-09-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, in the year <date value="1816"> 1816,</date> and consequently would have been <measure n="45years" type="date">forty five years</measure> of age on his approaching birth- day. A native of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and educated in his native State, he afterwards graduated at the <rs>University</rs> of our State with the highest honors that University can grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Immediately thereafter he proceeded to the study and practice of the law in his native city, and that profession he prosecuted, unremittingly, down to the time of his connection with this Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He was seldom engaged in political life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Once or twice &mdash; twice, I believe &mdash; his party almost forced him into the legislative halls of our own State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Once I know he went cheerfully, because a great public interest, upon which is based much of the prosperity of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, not only lagged, but was abandoned by its friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>A great effort was necessary to be made in order once more to push it on to completion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>With a generosity like him, with an earnestness his own, he went into the halls of our Legislature, and by, I might say, almost his unaided efforts, he once more brought the energies of our State to the completion of the road upon which so much of her prosperity is now based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>With these exceptions he never engaged in political life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>His party associations were always with that party whose distinguished leader, I see, is commemorated by a statue in these grounds, and a fit follower was he of a noble leader, and a high representative of a noble party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This I can say, because I never belonged to it. With the exceptions I mention, he never was connected with political life until the commotions which the coming storm produced in the political atmosphere, convinced my friend that a great revolution was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The cloud, though no larger than a man's hand, and the lightning, though it was but the sheet lightning of the <rs>North</rs>, convinced him that the storm was coming, and that it had to be resisted or the <rs>State</rs> would be crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>With a boldness like himself, with an earnestness which characterized all his conduct through life, he placed himself instantly in the very vanguard, and he remained there till he died. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Becoming a member of our <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>, he was selected as a most proper chairman of our most important committee, the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When that Convention looked around for the purpose of selecting a proper Delegate to be sent to this Congress, he was unanimously chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Afterwards, his history is known to you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Many of you will remember when the <rs>Representatives</rs> of the <num value="6">six</num> States met together in the <rs>Capitol</rs> of a distant sister State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Many of you well remember how, even in that band of undivided brothers, there necessarily arose some difference of opinion as to what should be done to meet the rapid march of mighty events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>And you all must remember how boldly he stood up for instant and immediate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I will not trespass upon your time by rehearsing what is familiar to you all &mdash; You know what his life was in our midst; you know how undaunted and bold he was when the time came for him to act; how modest and retired under all other circumstances; you know how important the position to which he was assigned; you know how well he discharged the duties of that position.--These are historical facts; it is not necessary for me to enlarge upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I would not do his memory the injustice of attempting to portray his character, and reveal to you the estimable virtues of his head and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I would say, however, sir, that his talents were not only of the highest order, but they were of that high order that could not descend to small things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Details never could be attended to by him. Great thoughts he grasped as Jove grasped the thunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The consequence was, that as a lawyer, in his arguments, he took broad views, despising petty quibbles, and even the necessary researches of the black letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>As a politician, or rather, I should say, as a statesman &mdash; you know well that these same characteristics were united in him. His heart, sir, was as great, and cast in a mould as gigantic as his mind hence a mean motive never entered his heart; hence a sordid interest was ever spurned with disgust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>His manners were to strangers rather cold and distant; to acquaintances, polite, but yet cordial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In the secrecy of private life he was as tender as a child &mdash; as demonstrative as an affectionate woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>As a son, a widowed mother weeps to-day over the loss of the pride of her heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Sisters weep to-day over a brother that was not only kind, but was tender in his affections towards them and towards their children &mdash; Need I speak of a wife?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Her devoted affections following him, as the beloved Disciples followed the master, until she could almost witness his crucifixion, is evidence of the affection which would draw forth such heroism as she has displayed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, in <num value="1">one</num> other relation of life I feel I ought to refer to my friend as a master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He has poured out his life-blood defending the institution which he believed to be sanctioned by <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>How dwelt he and how acted he in his positions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>An incident or <num value="2">two</num> will illustrate this better than many words can do. A faithful body servant (Jimmy his name,) attended him from his boyhood, when he was his playmate, even down to the moment when he left his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>I have heard he was with him on the field of battle, and it may be so. A few years ago, when the terrible scourge, the yellow fever, visited the seaboard of my native State, my friend, along with others, was stricken down by the pestilence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Although there were many nurses, yet there were many who could not be attended to professionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>My friend relied upon his faithful servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Faithful he was to him, and by his bedside he sat until he was convalescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>When he arose from that bed, it was merely to exchange places with the faithful watcher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/><persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> was also stricken down by the fever, and my friend bathed his temples, and held his hand, and administered to his comfort even as the faithful servant had administered to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>A few weeks ago, passing through the city of <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, and making his house my home, I noticed, sitting in his garden, several old decrepit slaves, I dared not ask him why they were there, but upon inquiring, I found that he had made the basement of his house, as it were, an alms-house for the decredid slaves of his deceased father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> were valueless, and, therefore, must be taken care of by some <num value="1">one</num>, and thus my friend took them under his own watchful care and protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>This is a commentary, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, upon the abuse heaped upon us by our enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> <num value="1">One</num> reference to his military career, his connection with this war, and I have done. --Having devised and inaugurated many of the measures as <rs type="role" reg="Chairman">Chairman</rs> of the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName>, my friend was deeply impressed with the conviction that it was his duty to take his sword in hand and go to execute what he had thus devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He communicated to myself and to others at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> this intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A company of volunteers of the city of <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, learning that such was his feeling, urged that they might be entered along with his own service, and that they might go together to the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>They were thus tendered &mdash; they were thus accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Before he reached this city his merits had already appointed him where the <rs>Executive</rs> authority of this Confederacy soon placed him, at the bead of a regiment Subsequently, a brigade was placed under his command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> When he determined thus to take his life in his hand, solemn thoughts passed through his mind, and coming events casting, as it were, a shadow before the sight of my friend, premonishing him he would never return to his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>This he communicated to several, as you and others around me know to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He communicated it also to his wife, as she has told me. This conviction became very strong upon him; but with a bravery heroic in itself, and heroic in the manner in which it executed its purpose, he marched straight forward to the death that he believed certainly awaited him. It was not a death that he feared &mdash; rather a death that he coveted. --His wife has communicated to me the fact that several times he told her his desire was to die on the battle-field defending the liberties of his country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> Of the manner of his death, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I can only speak from rumor; but I have taken pains to inquire from those who were nearest to him on that memorable occasion, and therefore I may speak with accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>During the day his own command had suffered much.--Towards noon, it became necessary, as I understand, for the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of our army, to keep from being flanked by the enemy, to fall back further and further towards its original position, occupied in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>About this time, the exact hour I cannot tell, my friend approached <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, the <rs>General</rs> commanding, and said, <q>&#x0022;What shall now be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Tell me, and if human effort can avail I will do it!&#x0022;</q> The reply was, <q>&#x0022;that battery should be silenced.&#x0022; </q> Seizing the standard of his own regiment, and calling the remnants of his command to rally and follow him, he led the van in the charge of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>A ball wounded him slightly and killed his horse under him. Still grasping the standard and rising again he mounted another horse, and waving his cap around his head, he cheered his boys to come on. They followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The next wound was from a ball that entered his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He spoke afterwards to the few of his brave boys who gathered around him. His words will ever be memorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>He said, <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">they have killed me, but never give up the field.</hi>&#x0022;</q> That last command was gallantly obeyed, and his boys silenced the battery of which he died in the charge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, in a few days or weeks I expect to follow the footsteps of my friend to the field of battle; and I confess to you, sir, that my natural heart prompted me to desire that upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle field I might meet and recognize his slayer, and with the bold eye and never arm of the avenger of death, I could strike him to the dust and almost gloat over his dying agonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>But a voice within me lays all such feelings low, the words of Holy Writ come to me: <q>&#x0022;Vengeance is mine;&#x0022;</q>--and I thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the promise--<q> &#x0022;I will repay saith the <rs>Lord</rs>.&#x0022;</q> Let us then, sir, wait on the <rs>Lord</rs>, <q>&#x0022;for the <rs>Lord Omnipotent</rs> reigned.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> The proposition of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Caskin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Caskin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Caskin</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, in the <name>Bankers</name>' Convention, that all the <name>Banks</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> shall receive each others notes as currency, and that each institution shall limit the amount of its issues to its capital stock, strikes us as <num value="1">one</num> of the most important that has been made in that Convention.--It is certain that such a measure would be productive of more convenience and advantage to the public than almost any that could be devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>We are not prepared to say what trouble the measure would occasion to the <name>Banks</name> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>But as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Caskie,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Caskie,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Caskie</surname></persName>'s</hi> proposition provides that all balances arising between them shall be liquidated in Treasury notes, we do not apprehend that the inconvenience could be very great. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> In consideration of the vast benefit and convenience that the rendering current of the money of all reputable <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> in every part of the <rs>South</rs> would confer upon the community, it would seem incumbent on the <name>Banks</name> to undertake such a measure at some cost of trouble to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>That merchants should be expected to receive from the people notes of distant <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, and should not be able with these notes to pay their own debts in Bank, would seem a heavy grievance to the merchants themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It is in fact a grievance so far as the inconvenience of exchanging such money for currency is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>But the cost of the exchange is charged of course to the public, and amounts to an immense sum of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>While the public loses this heavy <q>&#x0022;shave,&#x0022;</q> the <name>Banks</name> do not gain it. It goes into the pockets of the brokers, who devote themselves to the business of dealing in uncurrent notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Very probably the dealers in this paper do not themselves make much more than the cost of the trouble they are at in converting uncurrent funds into current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The failure of the <name>Banks</name>, therefore, to receive the notes of sister institutions in other States imposes a heavy loss upon the public, a serious inconvenience upon the merchants, trouble without profit upon the brokers, and secures no benefit to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It is an unmitigated and unnecessary trouble and loss which they inflict upon the business of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> There is some obligation upon the <name>Banks</name> to provide a remedy for this evil, arising out of the system of paper money of which they are the creators, and from which they derive all the profit and advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The function of supplying a currency to the community is a prerogative of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The Government by special acts of incorporation, conferring the special power, turns over to the <name>Banks</name> the right of issuing money for the use of the people, sometimes charging them a small bonus but usually allowing them to reap all the profit ensuring from the privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Reaping as they do this profit, which is considerable, there is a moral obligation upon these institutions to make such provision by arrangements with each other, that their notes shall have currency wherever the people who receive them as money are likely to want to use them as money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It is morally wrong that a soldier who receives a bank note as money at home should not be able to pass it off at its full value, as money, wherever the exigencies of the war in which he is engaged may call him. The neglect of the <name>Bank</name> to give currency to its notes wherever they are likely to be taken, is as inexcusable in respect to any other holder as to the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The obligation, the duty, is the same as to all citizens, and they are amenable to public censure when they fail to make effectual provision for giving currency to their notes at a time like the present throughout a common country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> We are glad to see, therefore, the proposition of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Caskie,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Caskie,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Caskie</surname></persName>.</hi> It alike looks to the correction of a great grievance suffered by the public, and to the compliance with a bounden obligation attaching to the <name>Banks</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The <rs>Banks</rs> are in the habit of exacting from the public a compliance with all its obligations to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Obligations are reciprocal; and it is the duty of the <name>Banks</name> to make the notes which they put out as money current as such wherever its holders are called in the service of their country.--There never was a plainer proposition in political casuistry than this; there never was a more sacred and binding moral obligation than that of the <name>Banks</name> in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It is an obligation, however, which they have not complied with, and which they should make haste to make good with the public. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> The Treasury notes of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> happily afford an admirable medium of exchange by which this obligation can be discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>If the <name>Bank</name> in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> refuses to receive the note of the <name>Bank</name> in <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> from unwillingness to trust that Bank, surely the objection is removed when informed that any balance of debt due will be discharged by its amount in Treasury notes, based on cotton in the hands of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>This security, and the additional <num value="1">one</num> that the notes of no Bank are issued in excess of its actual capital stock, affords a guarantee of reimbursement, which no Bank will pretend to be insufficient.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/> The Standing <orgName n="Convention Committee" type="committee">Committee of the Convention</orgName> of <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> beg leave to report on the following matters submitted to their consideration: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> On so much of <persName n="Whiting,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="nearbymention:Whiting,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whiting</surname></persName>'s resolution as relates to a further issue of Treasury Notes by the <rs>Government</rs>, they are of opinion that at least <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars, in addition to the notes already authorized by law, may be simply issued and put in circulation by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>They are persuaded that all the citizens of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> will readily accept them in payment in their mutual transactions; and the <name>Banks</name>, with equal unanimity, will adopt them as the currency of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>As the resolutions upon this subject, adopted by the <rs>Convention</rs> held at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta, Georgia</placeName>, applied necessarily only to the notes then authorized by law to be issued, they recommend the adoption of the following resolution on this subject: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the <name>Banks</name> here represented agree that they will receive in payment and on deposit, and pay out again, the <name>Treasury</name> notes that may be issued by the <rs>Government</rs>; and they recommend to all such <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as may not be represented in this Convention, to adopt the same resolution, and communicate their concurrence to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/> The object of the <rs>Government</rs> being to adopt these notes to perform the functions of currency, the committee are of opinion that the notes should bear the same date and carry the same rate of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>It will be impossible for the <name>Tellers</name> of the <name>Banks</name> and other persons engaged in handling money, to use these bills as currency if they varied in date and in the rate of interest.--If, on the contrary, they all bore the same date and the same rate of interest, they could be conveniently counted, and the sum ascertained as in the case of Bank notes; for it would be as easy to compute the interest on a <num value="100">hundred</num> bills as on <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>No loss would accrue to the <rs>Government</rs>, because in paying out the bills the disbursing officer would be careful to charge the rescinder with the interest as well as with the principal of the notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The interest should be <num value="0.02">2 per cent.</num> on every <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>, or at the rate of <num value="7">7</num>-<num value="8">8</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> per annum, That the notes should be redeemable in <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, at the option of the <rs>Government</rs>, and be receivable in all public dues, except the export duty on cotton, and be fundable at the will of the holder in <num value="0.08">8 per cent.</num> stock or bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Notes of the denominations of <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure>, <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure>, <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure>, in the opinion of the committee, ought not to bear any interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>These would more appropriately perform the functions of a currency, and they are of the opinion that the larger notes, such as <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> and <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> would be largely taken up by a class of our citizens who are not in the practice of making such investments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>These notes would pass into their hands in the course of business, and they would very soon discover the advantage as well as the merit of thus contributing their aid in support of the <rs>Government</rs> of their choice and of affections.--The committee gave also a respectful consideration to the plan submitted by <persName n="Holmes,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,J.,G.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName>, for the adjustment and final extinguishment of the public debt; but, without in any way impeaching its acknowledgement, they decided not to express any opinion as to the expediency of its adoption by the <rs>Government</rs>, for whose purposes its adoption could be best determined, in their opinion, by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>All of which is respectfully submitted, G. A. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Trenholm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="nearbymention:Trenholm,G.,A.,,"><surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>,</hi> Ch'n. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>And there was a certain suppliant named Old Dominion, venerable for age, of whose ancestry the rich man sprang.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>This poor man had been for many years robbed of his property, and when he complained, received insults and violence, with threats of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>He begged for a few constitutional crumbs which fell from the rich man's table, but was refused, and was left to bleed and die. </p>
