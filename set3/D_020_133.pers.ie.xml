<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> &#x0022;Here are the facts I wish to make known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The South has always been the enemy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, as the <rs>North</rs> has been her friend.--[Hear, and true] Every act of hostility has emanated from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Look along our history's page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>What was the non-intercourse act previous to the last war, but a <orgName n="Southern Institution" type="institution">Southern institution</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Was not the embargo act and the war of <num value="812">812</num> itself a <orgName n="Southern Institution" type="institution">Southern institution</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The whole <rs>North</rs> was against it, and the <rs>Hartford Conventioneers</rs>, to this day, are subjects of derision by the <name>Southerners</name> for the sympathy <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> showed for Old England.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>[Hear, and cheers.] What was the high Tariff act, the <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty- five cents</measure> a yard duty on cotton, of <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct>, but a <orgName n="Southern Institution" type="institution">Southern institution</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Boiling over with good will to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, we took the <rs>Prince</rs> and embraced him, because we loved this old land and its mighty associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> &#x0022;All this was in the <rs>North</rs>; but when he crossed the border into the slave country, he hastened away quickly, for fear of repeated insult!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Yes, gentlemen, it was in the <rs>Capital</rs> of the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>--<placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; that the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName> feared the action of the mob, and saw for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that he was not welcome in the land where once his ancestors ruled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has made a mistake &mdash; a fatal mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>To make sure that I am not in the wrong, I am preparing a book of opinions of the press &mdash; extracts from speeches of members of Parliament and the <name>Ministry</name>, which will prove the hostility of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> against the <rs>Federal</rs> power.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Yankee jack pudding"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The <rs>North</rs> began the revolutionary war. They did it through the ambition of their great men, who wished a wider field for the display of their abilities than was afforded by a country governed by another country <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure> off, and through the hatred which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> always have entertained, and will always entertain, towards <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <name n="Stamp Act" type="legislation">Stamp Act</name> and the duty on tea, and the principle they involved, were nothing to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They bated and envied the <rs>English</rs>; they felt rebuked in their presence, and they wished to get rid of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>That lay at the bottom of the war, and the encroachments of the <name>Crown</name> were only pleaded as an after- thought, and an apology for a foregone conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The South, on the contrary, had nothing to complain of. <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, especially, was always highly favored by the <name>Crown</name>, and her people complained of no oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>She took up arms in a cause which was not hers; so did <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, so did <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, so did <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and so did <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>These States had felt none of the grievances of which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> complained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They were well satisfied with their condition; but they determined to stand by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their struggle with the vast power and unbounded resources of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, come of it what might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><num value="1">One</num> of these States--<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, said as much when she joined the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and all the others, if they did not say so, yet acted from the same motive.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> There is really no necessity for any such order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>When, as in this case, a mercantile partnership has heretofore existed between <num value="1">one</num> of our citizens and a person now an alien enemy, and there are effects of the firm in this State, the partnership is dissolved by the war. The rights and interests of the alien enemy partner are liable to be sequestered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>But the rights and interests of the home partner in the effects of the firm are not thereby divested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>He may go on to collect his debts and wind up the business of the firm, without any order of court for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>He is of course bound to account and pay over to the receiver the portion of the effects which would otherwise go to his former partner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>He should allow the receiver access to the books of the firm, and from time to time give him all proper information about its business. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> If he mismanages this business in any way, the <rs type="place">Court</rs> may appoint a Receiver to take possession and management of the effects of the firm, on a proper showing being made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It is in this respect analogous to a case of dissolution of copartnership by the death or bankruptcy of <num value="1">one</num> of the partners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The surviving or solvent partner may go on to wind up the business, subject to account to the <unclear>ee</unclear> of the bankrupt or the representative of the deceased partner, and subject, too, in case of misconduct, to having a receiver appointed to take charge of the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>So in this case, the <name>Receiver</name>, under the sequestration law, is the representative of the alien enemy partner, and the home partner is like a solvent or surviving partner. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The explanation is this: The sportsman on going out loads both barrels, and on seeing a bird rise, fires naturally the right barrel; he reloads that barrel, and when he again sees a bird or a hare he fires it again, and so he does perhaps <num value="20">twenty</num> times in succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>But each firing gives a shock to the charge in the left hand barrel, and at last the succession of shock separates the wadding from the powder and shot; the consequence is that a vacuum ensues between them, and when the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> barrel is fired it frequently bursts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>To prevent this danger, the recommendation is made that whenever the right hand barrel is loaded, the charge in the left hand <num value="1">one</num> should also be rammed down. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> --The war illustrated the had policy of <num value="1">one</num> people depending upon another for every manufactured article of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>When the blockade and the interdiction of all communication with the <rs>North</rs> came upon us, we found that we were almost entirely deprived of every manufacture that we needed, whether for the war or household economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The necessities and wants unsupplied, that soon developed themselves, alarmed many, and set timid people to the most desperate reflections upon the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>They forgot that Necessity is the found and faithful <persName n="Invention,IsChild,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Invention,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsChild">mother of</roleName> <surname>Invention</surname></persName>, and that an intelligent and industrious, as well as patriotic, people were not to be conquered because they were threatened with a complete stoppage of the supply of <rs n="corn brooms" type="product">corn-brooms</rs> painted buckets, and clothes-pins: nor, indeed, of the more important articles of clothing, shoes, and hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It has been seen that although our people are not so ready at imitation and deception as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> they yet have the ingenuity and energy to take care of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>They have turned their hand to various branches of art and handwork, and we are getting along very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>As we progress, the variety of our fabrics, as well as the quantity, will be enlarged, and before the end of the war we shall be able to declare a double independencies if we choose: political and manufacturing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> Of the implements of war, our means for supplying our armies have been wonderfully increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>No nation ever displayed greater aptitude and energy in this respect for the emergency of a great war. Of all the branches of art, we were worse off in those of arms and munitions of war; and they were indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It has been found that even in these, the exigency commands the means, as it must always do with a brave and resolute people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Works for the supply of arms and ammunition have sprung up like magic, and are many months we shall hardly feel the want of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Our soldiers will be well and amply equipped from our own forges and shops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> In the departments of clothing the most rapid improvements have been made in our skill and capacity, and we find that our troops are better clothed than we could have anticipated, from our slender means at the beginning of the war. It is true the prices are high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>That was to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>We have, however, the assurance that what is manufactured at our own works is at least good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>As time passes, and our manufacturing power is increased, it is reasonable to conclude that the supply will be increased so as to diminish the cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>But is it not better to pay even the high prices that prevail, than that we should, if we could, send our money to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for our supplies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>What we pay the manufacturer is still at home, and to be disbursed at home by him; and we are encouraging and fostering those acts which will make us sufficiently independent in those exigencies of national wars to which all people are liable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> Looking over the field of domestic industry there is every reason for congratulating our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We have gotten along wonderfully well, and the highest proof has been afforded of our capacity to supply ourselves with every necessary of life as well as to defend ourselves against invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>No people on the globe has more completely within its own country the necessaries of life or the means of luxury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>No people &mdash; we are sure it will be proved &mdash; has a more indomitable spirit or more invincible determination to resist oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The war will leave us free, and it will prove us as much independent of the world as any nation could desire to be. </p> </div3>

<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">The Confederate flag.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> --The adoption of our present flag was a natural, but most pernicious blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>As the old flag itself was not the author of our wrongs, we tore off a piece of the dear old rag, and set it up as a standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>We took it for granted a flag was a <hi rend="italics">divisible</hi> thing, and proceeded to set off our proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>So we took, at a rough calculation, our share of the stars, and our fraction of the stripes, and put them together and called them the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Even as <persName><foreName>Aaron</foreName></persName> of old put the gold into the fire and then came out &#x0022;this calf,&#x0022; so certain stars and stripes went into committee, and then came out &#x0022;this flag.&#x0022; All this was honest and fair to a fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We were clearly entitled to from <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="11">eleven</num> of the stars, and to <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> of the stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Indeed, as we were maintaining the principles it was intended to represent, and the <rs>North</rs> had abandoned them, we were honestly entitled to the whole flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Had we kept it, and fought for it, and under it, and conquered it from the <rs>North</rs>, it would have been no robbery, but all right and fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>And we should either have done this, i. e., kept the flag as a whole &mdash; or else we should have abandoned it as a whole, and adopted another.--But if we did not choose to assert our title to the whole, was it politic and judicious to split the flag, and claim <num value="1">one</num> of the fractions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>We had an equal right also to Hail Columbia and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>We might have adopted a part of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle, (say every <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> stanza) or else <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle, with variations, as our national air. In the choice of an air, we were not guilty of this absurdity; but we have perpetrated <num value="1">one</num> exactly parallel to it, in the choice of a national flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>There is no exaggeration in the illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It seems supremely ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Yet it scarcely does our folly justice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> There is but <num value="1">one</num> feature <hi rend="italics">essential</hi> to a flag, and that is distinctness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Beauty, appropriateness, good taste, are all desirable, but the only thing <hi rend="italics">indispensable is distinctness</hi>--wide, plain, unmistakable distinction from other flags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Unfortunately this indispensable thing is just the thing which the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag lacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>And failing in this, it is a lamentable and total failure, absolute and irredeemable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The failure is in a matter of essence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It is as complete as that of writing which cannot be <hi rend="italics">read</hi>--of a gun which cannot be <hi rend="italics">shot</hi>--of a coat which cannot be <hi rend="italics">worn.</hi> It is the play of Hamlet, with the part of Hamlet left out. A flag which does not <hi rend="italics">distinguish</hi>--may be a very nice piece of bunting &mdash; it may be handsomely executed, tasteful, expressive, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other things, but it has no title at all to bear the name of <hi rend="italics">flag.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> We knew the flag we had to fight: yet, instead of getting as far from it, we were guilty of the hugs mistake of getting as near to it, as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>We sought similarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Adopting a principle diametrically wrong, we made a flag as nearly like their's as could, under favorable circumstances, be distinguished from it. Under unfavorable circumstances, (such as constantly occur in practice,) the <num value="2">two</num> flags are indistinguishable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>In the wars of the <name>Roses</name> in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> side adopted the white and the other the red rose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Suppose that our side had adopted milk white and the other flesh white, or <num value="1">one</num> deep pink and the other a lighter shade of pink, would there have been any and to the confusion? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> When a body of men is approaching in time </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> of war, it is rather an important matter to ascertain, if practicable, whether they are <hi rend="italics">friends</hi> or <hi rend="italics">foes.</hi> Certainly no question could well be more radical in its influence upon our action, plane, and movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>To solve this important question is the object of a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>When they get near us there may be other means of information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>But to distinguish friends from enemies at a distance is the specific purpose of a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Human ingenuity is great, and may conceive some other small purposes &mdash; presentations, toasts, speeches, &#x0026;c.--but that this is the great end of a flag, will not be denied; and it is in this that the confederate flag fails. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> There is no case in history in which broad distinction in <hi rend="italics">the symbols of the combatants</hi> was more necessary than it has been in the present war. Our enemies are of the same race with ourselves &mdash; of the same color and even shade of complexion &mdash; they <hi rend="italics">speak</hi> the same language, wear like clothing, and are of like form and stature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>[The more shame that they should make war upon us!] Our general appearance being the same, we must rely <hi rend="italics">solely upon symbols</hi> for distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The danger of mistake is great after all possible precautions have been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Sufficient attention has never been paid to this important matter, involving life or death &mdash; victory or defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Our badges, uniforms, flags, should be perfectly distinguishable from those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and distant information is dependent solely on the flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> To argue this objection further would be a waste of words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>And yet this <num value="1">one</num> objection is vital and insuperable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>We shall nevertheless add some other considerations, in another article on the same subject. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>This route, too, apart from its mere recommendation as an additional line of transportation, from North to South of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, has the advantage of traversing the district between the tide-water and <placeName reg="Piedmont, Augusta, Virginia" key="tgn,2113636">Piedmont</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Since the organization of the <rs>Government Congress</rs> has enacted some <num value="5000">five thousand</num> acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than <num value="6000">six thousand</num> closely-printed pages, and are scattered through many volumes Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best-in- formed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> It seems to me very important that the statue laws should be made as plain and intelligent as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fulness and precision of the will of the <name>Legislature</name> and the perspicuity of its language; these, well done, would, I think greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply affect their interests and their duties. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing law. This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the insurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of these States, the practical evil becomes more apparent.--There are no Courts, nor officers, to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful crime against citizens of the insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Some have estimated it as high as <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> of dollars, due in large part from insurgents, in open rebellion, to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> </div4>
