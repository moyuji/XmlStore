<head>Opening of the <rs>Great</rs> battle.<lb/><hi rend="italics">heavy engagement on the left of our lines.</hi></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Our city was startled, late yesterday evening, by reports of heavy ordnance, and by <num value="1">one</num> consent it was universally announced that the <name>Great Battle</name> had at last opened, and that the greatest and most momentous conflict of the age was fully inaugurated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>As far as we can ascertain, at a late hour of night it appears that our forces attacked the enemy with unparalleled fury at <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, and <unclear></unclear> the suddenness of the attack, the enemy were <unclear></unclear> nonplussed and driven from <num value="3">three</num> large <unclear>re-depots</unclear> in rapid succession, seizing the guns and <unclear> ming</unclear> them with terrific effect upon the foe.--This accomplished, our forces advanced and <measure n="2" type="captured">captured two</measure> lines of entrenchments and field, works, taking everything before them in gallant style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Co-operating with the movement on the supreme right and rear of the enemy, our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> <unclear> ssed</unclear> the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> at <num value="2">two</num> points, viz!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>by the <rs type="place">Mechanicsville bridge</rs> and <placeName reg="Meadow Bridge, Fayette, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119163">Meadow bridge</placeName>, attacking the enemy with great dash and ardor, having in their outposts, and ascending the opposes hills, seized the batteries erected thereon, and fully commanding the future movements of our forces in crossing the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In doing this, the rapidity of movement was such that the enemy was unprepared, and lost a monster battery, which <unclear></unclear> our troops to the right and left of <unclear></unclear> River Railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This achievement in <unclear></unclear> of incalculable value, and is equivalent to the saving of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><persName n="Branch,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Branch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Branch</surname></persName>, we understand, led the advance down the <placeName key="tgn,2119163" n="1.000 151" reg="meadow bridge, fayette, west virginia">Meadow Bridge</placeName> road with a brigade of North <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, <unclear></unclear> crossing, were instantly reinforced by <unclear></unclear> troops of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hill,D.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <unclear>nu </unclear> field works and batteries opposed to their advance were assailed by our men in the coolest <unclear></unclear> most nonchalant style imaginable, and while having the heavy masses of <orgName n="Federal Infantry" type="infantry">Federal infantry</orgName> before <unclear></unclear> were ably seconded by our heavy guns, which, <unclear></unclear> with terrific noise, threw large shells thick and fast upon the enemy's chosen positions and camps, thus preventing our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> forces from being overpowered by the swarming hordes of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s hirelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>While these brilliant movements were progressing in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Meadow Bridge, Fayette, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119163">Meadow Bridge</placeName>, our troops beyond the <rs type="place">Mechanicsville Bridge</rs> formed a junction with them, thus forming a perfect cordon with others operating from the village of <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Our line being perfect, a general advance took place, but the brave Confederates had not progressed far ere they were encountered by the <rs>Federals</rs> in great force, and a terrific fight ensued; but onward pressed our infantry and artillery, until at <time value="9pm">9 P. M.</time> when the heavy cannonading ceased, it was generally known that the enemy had been driven fully <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, having experienced great loss in every shape, but particularly in artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><orgName n="Purcell Battery" type="battery">Purcell's battery</orgName>, we are informed, immortalized itself, and was the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">first corps</orgName> that crossed <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName> bridge, and opened fire on the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>At <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, the heaviest fighting is said to have taken place on <placeName><persName n="Watts,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Watts,nomatch:0"><surname>Watts</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, but resulted magnificently to us. All the heights beyond the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> are in our possession, thus ensuring the safe and speedy transportation of troops and munitions to the other side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> From the late hour at which we write, it is impossible to obtain particulars of the sanguinary engagement of yesterday, but the facts stated are substantially correct, while much more was effected by the forces engaged than the most sanguine could have expected or predicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The enemy were totally routed whenever they made a stand &mdash; batteries, entrenchments, field- works, camps, and farms, were captured with great rapidity, and our loss is much less than could have been imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In all likelihood, the engagement to-day will prove a general <num value="1">one</num> at all points, and let us reverently hope that the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles will smile propitiously upon our efforts, and crown our forces with a complete and glorious triumph over malignant and relentless enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The more we learn of the fight near the old battle ground of <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, the greater are we satisfied that it was <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant affairs of the war, redounding greatly to our honor, and worthy of fitting memory and commendation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> From the best information, we learn that the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA1">1st Louisiana</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="GA3">3d Georgia</orgName> had brought upon themselves the especial hatred of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, while on picket service near <placeName><persName n="Barker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Barker,nomatch:0"><surname>Barker</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>; for on <num value="1">one</num> occasion last week these <num value="2">two</num> regiments suddenly appeared before the affrighted enemy, (<persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName>'s Excelsior brigade,) and, without much ceremony, drove them from their picket posts, and chased them through adjacent camps, inflicting much loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>From deserters and others, it was ascertained that the officers of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> had offered <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> to any <num value="1">one</num> bringing in any man of the <num value="2">two</num> named regiments, whether dead or alive, and vowed eternal vengeance against them, determining to lay some snare to entrap them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>At <time value="8am">8 A. M.</time> Tuesday the pickets along the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road, near the old battle ground, gave warning of the enemy's approach in force, and retired, as usual, to their supports. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Believing an attack was imminent, <persName n="Wright,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Wright,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName> ordered up the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC48">48th North Carolina (Col. Rutledge's) regiment</orgName>, which moved up the road and took position to the left of it, in an open field, with dense woods on their left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The right of the road was occupied by the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA1">1st Louisiana</orgName>, and to their right were the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="GA4">4th Georgia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <name>North</name> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> were in an exposed position, but maintained their ground without flinching, losing not less than <measure n="100" type="killed and wounded">100 killed and wounded</measure>. The position of the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA1">1st Louisiana</orgName> was equally disadvantageous. --Before them was a thick chaparral, in which the enemy were strongly posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Behind this, also, several brigades were drawn up, their flanks extending beyond, so that they kept up a continual fire upon the <name>Louisianians</name>, inflicting sad loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Being ordered to charge, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> advanced nobly, with the <unclear></unclear> <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,Franklin,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>and New Orleans!&#x0022;</q> and at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dash drove the enemy forth with great havoc.--But emerging into the open field behind, they were astonished to discover not less than <num value="3">three</num> brigades opposing them, viz: <persName n="Meagher,,Thomas,Francis,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Meagher,Thomas,Francis,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <surname>Meagher</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="Irish Brigade" type="brigade">Irish brigade</orgName>, <persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName>'s Excelsior brigade, and another <num value="1">one</num>, the name of which we could not ascertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Bravely holding their ground, the <name>Louisianians</name> maintained the unequal contest with great dash and boldness, the enemy quailing and retiring before their steady and deadly fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>To their right, however, things were progressing favorably, where the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="GA22">22d Georgia</orgName> were holly engaged with the enemy, who, after some <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> hard fighting, slowly and reluctantly retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Comparisons are odious, but it is admitted that the conduct of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC48">48th N. C.</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="LA1">1st La.</orgName>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="GA4">4th Ga.</orgName>, was beyond all praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these regiments was perfectly fresh from home, and had never been under fire before; yet there they stood, in open field, waiting for the cowards to advance, and although <persName n="Rutledge,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Rutledge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Rutledge</surname></persName> reports a loss of <measure n="100" type="killed and wounded">100 killed and wounded</measure>, his brave fellows never gave an inch of ground, but kept up a murderous fire upon the foe, who suffered so much that, although <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, they did not dare to leave the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The <rs>Louisianians</rs> went into action with <num value="300">300</num>, and lost <measure n="144" type="killed and wounded">144 killed and wounded</measure>. These figures are more than enough to demonstrate <hi rend="italics">their</hi> conduct in the fight &mdash; for <hi rend="italics">every <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> man fell!</hi> The <orgName type="regiment" key="GA4">4th Georgia</orgName>, it is said, acted like very devils, and fought and charged <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> regiments <num value="3">three</num> several times!</hi>--and, more than this routed them, losing not less than <num value="50">50</num> in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="GA22">22d Georgia</orgName> lost some <num value="90">ninety</num> odd in killed and wounded, and behaved splendidly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> brigades engaged were <orgName n="Irish Brigade" type="brigade"><persName n="Meagher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Meagher,Thomas,Francis,,"><surname>Meagher</surname></persName>'s Irish Brigade</orgName>, <persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName>'s <q>&#x0022;Excelsior Brigade,&#x0022;</q> and another, unknown, some of their other regiments being the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="MA19">19th Massachusetts</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="NY2">2d New York</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="IN20">20th Indiana</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="NJ9">9th New Jersey</orgName>, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c. <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> had <num value="5">five</num> regiments, <persName n="Meagher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Meagher,Thomas,Francis,,"><surname>Meagher</surname></persName>'s the same number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>If the <rs>Northern</rs> public and the outside world were dependent upon the official dispatches of their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> for the scones and incidents of the invasion, it would vote the whole thing an insufferable bore and refuse any further supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The <rs>Generals</rs> give professional reports merely, and, though the dryness of such productions is relieved in their case by a fertility of invention peculiar to their race, the filling up of the outlines, the grouping and coloring, as well as creation of facts, are the peculiar provides of the newspaper correspondents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>When <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> ordered them to be expelled from the army, he showed his miserable jealousy of a genius for Monochasium superior even to his own. To find his most mendacious reports transcended by the exaggerations of a newspaper letter was more than he could bear.--Thus, for example, when he declared that if the <rs n="Battle of Chickahominy" type="battle">battle of Chickahominy</rs> had begun <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> earlier he would have been in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by night, he might naturally have felicitated himself upon the production of a lie which the invention of <persName n="Gulliver,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Gulliver,nomatch:0"><surname>Gulliver</surname></persName> would despair of rivalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>And yet, scarcely had he time to flatter himself upon this unapproachable achievement, before a letter appeared in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> newspapers, in which the writer declared that the rebel troops were actually chased into <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> at the point of the bayonet!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Why had he never thought of rounding off his dispatch with that most beautiful and transcendent fiction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>No wonder that he raves at the sight of a newspaper correspondent like a mad dog at the sight of water. </p>
