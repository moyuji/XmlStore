<head>Contraband &mdash; their Sad fate.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, so fertile in excuses for their outrages in this war, very readily invented the application of the term &#x0022;contraband&#x0022; to Southern slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>They determined to take the step of stealing these slaves from their owners, to whom the ancestors of these same <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> sold the slaves aforesaid; and in order that the stealing might have somewhat the semblance of order and authority, they declared the slaves &#x0022;contraband,&#x0022; and it was further declared unlawful to return them to their owners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It is remarkable, however, that even after they are taken from their homes and their masters &mdash; after they are enjoying association and such freedom as they have among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--they are still called &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; A cannon is &#x0022;contraband of war&#x0022; in its route to the enemy's ports; but if it is captured, and put in use by the captor, it is no longer contraband to him. The poor negro, however, has a different fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He is still a doomed &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; The name sticks to him as a term of derision, after he ceases to be, under the authority of such law as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have for him, a &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; Yet this is not all: he continues in <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> and practice a &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; He is not allowed his promised equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>His <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> master denies him the privileges of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He subjects him to indignities and mental service, and if he adorns him with a uniform, and puts a gun in his hand, it is only that he may become a breastwork to shield the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from Confederate bullets; or to be the minister of some barbarities, which his ignorance of the usages of war, and his rude instincts and passions, very well fit him for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> We have seen enough in this war to know what a cruel, selfish, and malignant spirit it is that controls the people of the <rs>North</rs>, in their measures relating to the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They care nothing for him. They only use him to injure us, and thus gratify their malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They have no mercy for him, and will throw him off to seek his home and livelihood as he may. They will then cry, &#x0022;Lo, the poor negro!&#x0022; as they cried &#x0022;Lo, the poor <name>Indian</name>!&#x0022; after they had robbed him of his rich domains, and sent him to the <rs>Western</rs> forests, covered with sores and cursed with the vices of civilization! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The illustrations of the misery the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are bringing upon the hapless children of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> &mdash; those &#x0022;<rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> descent,&#x0022; as the hideous monster at the lead of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> styles them in mockery &mdash; are of daily occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>An instance just to hand is afforded in an order issued by <persName n="Kelley,,A.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Kelley,A.,W.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Kelley</surname></persName>, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> and Health Officer at <rs n="Natchez" type="nativeamerican">Natchez</rs>, approved by <persName n="Tuttle,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Tuttle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig. Gen.</roleName> <surname>Tuttle</surname></persName>, in command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This order we published in the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In this order the negroes are pronounced lazy and profligate, unused to caring for &#x0022;themselves, thriftless for the present, improvident of the future.&#x0022; He adds: <q>&#x0022;The most of them loaf idly about the streets and alleys, prowling in secret places, and lounge lazily in crowded hovels, which soon become dens of noisome filth, the hot-beds fit to engender and rapidly disseminate the most loathsome and malignant diseases.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> To remedy these evils what does the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> surgeon, approved by the <rs>General</rs>, propose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Why, in effect, to return the negro to his state of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Indeed, to subject him to rigors he had never known when under his lawful master's authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Every &#x0022;contraband&#x0022; (thus the order styles them,) is required immediately to hire himself or herself to a master, and to sojourn under that master's roof and nowhere else, the master or hirer being required to become responsible for the contraband he so employs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It further declares that &#x0022;no contraband will be allowed to hire any premises in this city for <hi rend="italics">any purpose whatever; </hi> and no other person shall be allowed to hire such premises for the purpose of evading this order, nor allowed to hire or harbor any contraband who cannot satisfy the health officer that he or she needs the service of said contraband in some legitimate employment.&#x0022; What amiable and humane administrators of law and police these Northern philanthropists are!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><persName n="Kelley,Surgeon,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Kelley,A.,W.,,"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <surname>Kelley</surname></persName> tells all and singular, in this notable order, that an attempt to <hi rend="italics">evade</hi> the order &#x0022;will be punished &#x0022;more severely than the <hi rend="italics">direct</hi> infraction of &#x0022;it!&#x0022; Of course, there could be no hesitation as to violation by evasion or open disobedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is somewhat a departure from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ethics, to denounce the sin of <hi rend="italics">evasion</hi> as greater than that of <hi rend="italics">open violation.</hi> The <hi rend="italics">ingenuity</hi> of success by indirection, has generally elicited praise, where the folly of open resistance has ever provoked the censures of the wise <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But we like the bold discrimination of this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> surgeon; evasion is mean and contemptible, and deserving harsher punishment than direct opposition, which has at least the virtue of frankness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If his principle of law were established in the land of the &#x0022;saints,&#x0022; it would produce a world of inconvenience and trouble! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> But of the poor negro, <persName n="Kelley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Kelley,A.,W.,,"><surname>Kelley</surname></persName> does not dispose of even here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He adds another article, which provides that &#x0022;persons drawing rations from the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> are not supposed to need many hired servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The number needed by each family will be determined by the undersigned,&#x0022; namely, <persName n="Kelley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Kelley,A.,W.,,"><surname>Kelley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Government does not mean to feed idle negroes, that is clear! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Was there ever a more thorough <hi rend="italics">ban</hi> put upon the descendants of <persName n="Ham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Ham,nomatch:0"><surname>Ham</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Well may the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> call him &#x0022;contraband.&#x0022; Literally does he fulfill the curse upon the descendants of <persName n="Ham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Ham,nomatch:0"><surname>Ham</surname></persName>: that they shall be the servants of servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>What are the ill-fated people of <rs n="Natchez" type="nativeamerican">Natchez</rs> but <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> servants, since they are subjected to domiciliary visits and the commands of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officials as to how many servants they shall have and what other privileges they shall enjoy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>And the contraband are ordered to become the servants of these people, on pain of being driven out of the city and kept in prison bounds, in what a philanthropic correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> calls a &#x0022;Krall&#x0022;--a place to keep cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This, on a small scale, illustrates the ultimate fate of the negro at the hands of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>All that cannot be made useful, will be driven forth to some place where the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will not be troubled with them; and that place must not be any place that is fertile &mdash; that has sweet waters and fine groves &mdash; for such place the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will never give up to the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It must be some <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 5" reg="rossiya">Siberia</placeName>, undesirable to the <name>Saints</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Tribunes,</hi> no doubt very truly, says that, subjected to these crucifies, many negroes &#x0022;who had kind masters resolved to return to slavery.&#x0022; &#x0022;Whole <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> families had lived together with their masters; but now they must be separated.&#x0022;-- &#x0022;Lo, the poor negro!&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The probability of encountering upon the ocean an enemy whose interest it is to avoid a meeting is strikingly illustrated by facts in the naval history of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Not only single vessels, but whole fleets, have often managed to keep out of the way of a hostile squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Take the following remarkable instances: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> In <dateStruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></dateStruct>, apprehending a French invasion, <persName n="Norris,Sir,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Norris,John,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Norris</surname></persName> was sent from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with a large squadron to intercept the <orgName n="French fleet" type="fleet">French fleet</orgName>, which consisted of <num value="20">twenty</num> ships and a land force of <num value="22000">twenty-two thousand</num> men. The <rs>French</rs> succeeded in sailing the short distance to the <rs>British</rs> coast without meeting any opposition, and was only prevented from landing the troops by a storm, which drove them back upon the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> for shelter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> In <dateStruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></dateStruct> an <orgName n="English fleet" type="fleet">English fleet</orgName> of several ships of the line and some frigates were sent to intercepts a <orgName n="French fleet" type="fleet">French fleet</orgName> of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> ships of the line and many smaller vessels, which had sailed from <placeName key="tgn,7008258" n="1.000 7" reg="brest,finistere,bretagne,france,europe">Brest</placeName> for <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The fleets passed each other in a thick fog.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> In <dateStruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></dateStruct> a British force, under <persName n="Boy,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Boy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Boy</surname></persName>, blockaded a <orgName n="French fleet" type="fleet">French fleet</orgName> in the port of <placeName key="tgn,2068864" n="1.000 13" reg="dunkirk, chautauqua, new york">Dunkirk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The <name>French</name> commander, seizing a favorable opportunity, not only escaped from his enemy, but attacked the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and cruised about till the next year, without meeting a single <name>British</name> vessel, although <num value="61">sixty one</num> <name>British</name> ships of the line were then stationed upon the coasts of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>I started early in the morning, having read <hi rend="italics">The Times's</hi> appeal for a quiet and respectable reception, such as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> usually accords to distinguished visitors, and got on the top of an omnibus about <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> off from the <num value="9">Nine</num> <placeName reg="Elms Station">Elms Station</placeName>, where he was to be received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Even at that distance the streets were swarming more than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The omnibus and cab drivers had the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> colors &mdash; <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">green</rs>, on their breasts &mdash; and the low <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> were at their doors angry and excited &mdash; cursing all who wore the colors, and abusing the &#x0022;church robber.&#x0022; Already at <num value="11.5">11&#x00BD;</num> the best seats around Charring Cross were occupied &mdash; the balconies of houses covered with people &mdash; although it was certain that the hero could not pass that way for <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7hours" type="date">seven hours</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Around this the crowd was already vast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>At last the agitation of the multitude announced that the train had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>People pressed forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>On the great glass roof of the building people climbed up (outside) and shattered panes of glass with their fists to see the hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>At last he appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>As he entered it was manifest that the people would forget the advice of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> about an &#x0022;orderly and quiet&#x0022; reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The programme so carefully prepared by committees and <orgName n="City Council" type="council">City Council</orgName> was infringed <hi rend="italics">a Drontrance</hi> Some woman held up her child with a beautiful bouquet in its hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Then, when the workingmen's address was read, it contained, contrary to all advice, a glowing eulogium on that very <persName n="Mazzini,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Mazzini,nomatch:0"><surname>Mazzini</surname></persName> for being whose friend <persName n="Stanfield,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Stanfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanfield</surname></persName> had been hounded out of the <rs>Government</rs>; nay, more, when that massage was read (O, what will <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName> N. say!) the building rang with plaudits for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. And to cap the climax, when that address was through, an <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> woman, whose head was as near <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>'s feet as ever saint's was to the <rs>Pope</rs>'s toe, burst out with uncontainable fervor and pathos into a noble address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Ordinarily the police would have pounced upon any woman speaking on such an occasion, but <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> bent his eye downward and listened with such feeling to his countrywoman's words that none dared interfere with or interrupt her. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> When I left with the crowd I got away by a blind passage to the river, and went back to <placeName reg="Westminster, Carroll, Maryland" key="tgn,2049138">Westminster</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>It was a glorious day and a glorious sight that now greeted my eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The magnificent <rs>Westminster Hall</rs>, which borders on the river, lifted up its superb towers; but now every tower and turret was alive with human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The bridge itself, the finest, doubtless, in the world, was lined with human beings waiting for the great procession.--From this point up to Charring Cross was <num value="1">one</num> mass of human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>At Charring Cross the <rs>Nelson</rs> column rose into the air out of a pediment formed of human faces up to the smooth column itself. --The equestrian statue of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="1">I</genName></persName>. was similarly covered &mdash; a chimney sweep on top amusing the crowd by standing behind the statue and placing the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> colors now on the statue's head, now on his own, placing his dusty cap on the head of the poor <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The sweep received the plaudits accorded him with great solemnity, bowing graciously on each side, and waving his hand with the dignity of an opera singer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>From this point I looked in every direction, and saw a multitude that no man could number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Every <rs n="Gas Light" type="newspaper">gas light</rs>, signboard, balcony, house-top, door-step, window, presented to the eye only a mighty efflorescence of human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>And not less remarkable was the good order preserved by these masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The last crowd I had seen was that which had assembled to witness the execution of the pirates of the <rs>Flowery Land</rs> at Newgate &mdash; a mass of bloated and sottish thieves and prostitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>But here was another class altogether &mdash; the laboring masses of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; and from my own observation of them I anticipated that the police courts would reap (as they did) fewer cases than ever before from a London crowd. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> Slowly the procession crept by us, for the people miles off were blocking the way to cheer the hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>As the banners passed I interested myself in observing the immense number of Societies, Unions, Clubs, &#x0026;c., whose existence was indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Societies passed with all sorts and kinds of symbols &mdash; suns, moons, stars, ladders, fishes, implements, tools, birds, beasts, men, women, <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, <persName n="Peel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Peel,nomatch:0"><surname>Peel</surname></persName>, <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>, <rs type="role" n="Queen">Queens</rs>, all these, amid showers of symbols, passed by on flags whose age announced that they were societies of long standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>But, alas for the teetotalers, only <num value="1">one</num> poor little temperance flag passed, and that, I am bound to say, was greeted with loud and real laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>If the total abstinence folks in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> wish to succeed, they will have to make friends with the poor man's beer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>However, I should add that during the whole day I saw neither drunken man or woman, except at <num value="1">one</num> point, a public house, where some low <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> had gathered and were swearing what they would do with <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> How long the procession was, and how slowly it had to move, may be judged by the fact that, though it started at about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> from <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms, not quite <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> from Charring</placeName> Cross, it was <time value="7:30">half-past 7</time> when the <rs>General</rs> passed this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>And when he did, the scene beggars description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The people climbed up <num value="1">one</num> upon the other to catch a glimpse of him, and as he passed through it was as if a great living see piled up its waves in walls on each side of his chariot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Meanwhile there rose the joyful shouts of leaping hearts &mdash; uttered in every language of the earth &mdash; that, as they floated up to old <persName n="Martin,,St,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="default:Martin,St,,,"><foreName>St</foreName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName>'s steeple, seemed to move the tongues of its chimes which now broke forth with carols and peals happy enough to have inspired <persName n="Dickens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="mostcommon:Dickens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dickens</surname></persName> to write a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story about them, or to call back another <persName n="Whittington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Whittington,nomatch:0"><surname>Whittington</surname></persName> to work from his shop to be <rs type="role" reg="Lord Mayor">Lord Mayor</rs> of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, or, better, to be a devoted champion of Justice and Liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> Let me now say a few words about <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It must be borns in mind that, by a fine coincidence, the word <rs>Garibald</rs> I means &#x0022;Bold in War.&#x0022; The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> etymon <hi rend="italics">Gar</hi> is the old <rs>Saxon</rs> for War, and indeed the <rs>English</rs> word <hi rend="italics">War</hi> as well as the <rs>French</rs> <hi rend="italics">guerre</hi> are descended from it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>He is a most noble person, with a fascinating presence; the lion and the lamb strangely alternating in his expression of face, voice and manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>During all the reception there was a look and manner about him which must have dissipated the hopes of any tootle or quietists who imagined that he might be here to receive either rest or flattering receptions; he spoke but few words, warm as they are, and his eye looked over and beyond the crowd to an object which his life exists only to attain. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/>
