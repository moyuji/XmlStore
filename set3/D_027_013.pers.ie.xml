<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> The news from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> pours in upon us with such rapidity, and is of a character so astounding, that we are scarcely allowed time take breath or to collect our ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>In fact, we are almost as much confounded as the <rs>Washington</rs> and <rs>Baltimore</rs> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves, though perhaps not so badly frightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Who are these rebels?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Where did they come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Did they spring up out of the earth or drop down from the clouds?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It is pronounced a &#x0022;fizzle&#x0022; by the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, and a &#x0022;fiasco&#x0022; by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>What on earth, then, can it all mean?

<head>A Naval duel in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> In the month of <date value="1813-06">June, 1813,</date> there was great rejoicing in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> over the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> streak of good luck that had occurred to them in their naval contests with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The exuberance of their delight resembled that which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> exhibit over the destruction of the <rs>Alabama</rs>, and of itself was a tribute to the prowess of the adversary whom for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time they had succeeded in overcoming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The combat, a regular naval duel, resembles in so many points that of the <rs>Alabama</rs> and <rs>Kearsarge</rs> that a recital of the circumstances may not be without interest at this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> The <rs>British</rs> attributed their constant defeats in the late war to the larger size of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> vessels and longer range of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> guns, which hammered them to pieces before they could get to close quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>It may have been that such inequalities did exist, though not in all cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>They resolved, however, that they would fit out a vessel capable of coping with <num value="1">one</num> of the largest <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> frigates, and challenge her to a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>At this time the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Chesapeake</rs>, commanded by <persName n="Lawrence,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="mostcommon:Lawrence,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lawrence</surname></persName>, was lying in <placeName key="tgn,1114422" n="1.000 1" reg="boston harbor, massachusetts, united states">Boston harbor</placeName>, nearly ready for sea. <persName n="Lawrence,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:Lawrence,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Lawrence</surname></persName>, a gallant and popular officer, had just returned from a victorious career, having, while in command of the <term n="US ship">U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>For this brilliant action he was promoted to the command of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, and while thus in command, the <rs>Shannon</rs>, the ship prepared by the <rs>English</rs> for a contest with large <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> frigates, appeared off the harbor and made signals expressive of a challenge.--<persName n="Broke,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Broke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Broke</surname></persName>, commander of the <rs>Shannon</rs>, also sent a written challenge to <persName n="Lawrence,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Lawrence,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Lawrence</surname></persName>, (which did not arrive, however, till after he had sailed,) couched in the most bland and courteous terms; minutely detailing the force of his ship; and offering, if the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> should not be completely prepared, to cruise off and on till such time as she made a specified signal of being ready for the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>There is certainly a contrast between British and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> charity, for the manner in which <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> was left in the dark as to the superior strength of the <rs>Kearsarge</rs> will be-regarded by his countrymen as adding a new leaf to the credit of <persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00260" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> have always contended that the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> was not prepared for the contest, whereas the <rs>Shannon</rs> was specially made ready in armament and crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Here is another point of analogy with the late contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> says that <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00261" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> came out &#x0022;with a ship just returned from a long voyage and much in want of repair, to encounter a far larger, better manned, better armed, provided, as it turned out, with some special contrivance for protection,&#x0022; &#x0026;c. Moreover, the <rs>Kearsarge</rs> was built for fighting, and the <rs>Alabama</rs> for speed, whereas the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> was built as a ship of war, and we have never seen it pretended that her adversary surpassed her in size. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> On the <date value="06-01">1st of June</date> the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> put out to sea, and, like the <rs>Alabama</rs>, commenced the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The battle was fought within pistol shot, and was short, desperate and bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The execution in both ships was terrible, but the fire of the <rs>Shannon</rs> peculiarly fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The officers as well as the men of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> suffered severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot killed the selling master, the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-4">fourth lieutenant</rs> received at the same time a moral wound, and at the same moment <persName n="Lawrence,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="mostcommon:Lawrence,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Lawrence</surname></persName> was shot through the leg with a musket ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/><num value="3">Three</num> men were shot <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> from the helm of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> successively, and thus, from a cause somewhat similar to that of the <rs>Alabama</rs>, the steerage of the ship was disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>But the crowning blow was given by the boarding the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>About <num value="20">twenty</num> of the <rs>Shannon</rs>'s men, seeing a favorable opportunity for boarding, without waiting for orders, jumped on the deck of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/><persName n="Broke,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="mostcommon:Broke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Broke</surname></persName>, with the regular boarders followed, and the remarkable combat was soon terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The gallant <rs>Lawrence</rs> died of his wound, manifesting to the last a heroic spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>But his ship was fairly whipped, and the exultation of the <rs>English</rs> knew no bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>We never heard, however, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> of that day admitted that &#x0022;<num value="1">one</num> swallow makes a summer.&#x0022; They had never known a set off to the success of the <rs>Shannon</rs> in the long career of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> nations, and we are not without similar consolation in the fate of the <rs>Alabama</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> That vessel has done more than enough for the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause to afford the loss of her hull and armament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The spirit that animated her still survives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It was not the <rs>Alabama</rs>, it was <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00264" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName>, who was the scourge of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The vessel was merely a weapon in the hands of the skilled swordsman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The <rs>Sumter</rs> was as much a thorn in their sides as the <rs>Alabama</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>What difference did it make when the <rs>Sumter</rs> was lost and the <rs>Alabama</rs> took her place?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>What difference will it make that the <rs>Alabama</rs> has sunk, when another, and possibly a better vessel takes the place of the <rs>Alabama</rs>? &#x0022;The pirate <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00265" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName>&#x0022; still lives and will soon be on the waves again. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Observe the tone in which this annunciation is made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The desolate condition of our country is made a reproach to us by the very wretches who have made it thus desolate.
