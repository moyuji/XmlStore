<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We mentioned in our issue of yesterday that passengers by the <rs>Central</rs> read reported that heavy firing was heard in the direction of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, and that the opinion obtained that a severe fight was in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It has since transpired that this firing was near <placeName reg="Rixeyville, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2113994">Rixeyville, in Culpeper county</placeName>, between the forces of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and the advance of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The affair resulted in a very sharp skirmish, in which the enemy were driven back over the <placeName reg="Hazel, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124592">Hazel</placeName> and <placeName reg="Dunavant, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2111530">Rappahannock rivers</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>What the loss was on either side we were not able to learn, but officers who came down on the train last evening attach little importance to the engagement, and regard it as a mere skirmish, and not by any means indicating a prospect of an early general battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The firing is said to have continued at intervals from <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time> in the morning until <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> in the afternoon. </p> </div3>

<head>The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York times</orgName> and &#x0022;<num value="290">290</num>&#x0022;.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> The story which we published yesterday, from the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, with regard to the steamship <q>&#x0022;<num value="290">290</num>&#x0022;</q> appears to us to be wanting in probability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>In the first place, that paper enjoys an unenviable notoriety, as the most mendacious of the whole vile Abolition press of the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It was in the habit of sending to the <rs>South</rs>, before this war broke out, correspondents for the express purpose of writing lies with regard to occurrences which they professed to witness in this quarter, and of publishing their reports for no other object than to degrade the inhabitants of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>A scoundrel of that sort was sent here with instructions to write home that he was a witness to an insult offered to the <rs>Prince</rs> of <persName n="Waler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Waler,nomatch:0"><surname>Waler</surname></persName>, upon the occasion of his visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He took up his lodgings in the outskirts of the city, and was never nearer the <rs>Prince</rs> than <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure>; yet he wrote, as ordered, and although his statement was pronounced a lie by every person within hearing of the insult, if it had been offered, and although the <rs>Mayor</rs> of the city, who was standing within a few feet of the <rs>Prince</rs> at the time, and would instantly have caused the offender to be arrested, if there had been any offence, published a card stigmatizing a as it deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It never had the manhood to public these contradictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>In the second place, it is hardly possible that the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> could know of any such proceeding on the part of the <rs>British Consul</rs>, if he had thus proceeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Are we to suppose that the <rs>Consul</rs> of a great nation makes a confident of the editor of a newspaper, and such a paper as the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> and pours his official secrets into his ear, that they may be published the next day to the whole world!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Again, if the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> be thus deep in the confidence of the <rs>British Consul</rs> at New York, are we to understand that it is equally deep in the confidence of <persName n="Milnes,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Milnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Milnes</surname></persName>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> The doctrine that the vessel covers the cargo, that is that the cargo with regard to political relations is of the same character with the vessel that carries it, though long disputed, has, to the best of our recollection, been at length conceded by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If, therefore, a British vessel be laden with merchandise belonging to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> owners, the imparts her nationality to such cargo, and is no more lawful for a Confederate vessel to take it, than it would be to make prize of the ship itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>On the other hand, a cargo belonging to <name>British</name> subjects, becomes, when on board of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vessel, of the same nationality with that vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>At least, if this be not law, it is common sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>If the rule were otherwise, every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vessel that sailed from New York, or any other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> harbor, might secure itself against capture, by taking a small portion of <name>British</name> merchandize on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The owner knows very well what he is risking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>He knows that the <rs>Confederates</rs> are at war with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and that they have cruisers at sea. If he choose to put merchandise on board a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vessel, under such circumstances, he does it at his own risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>If it be captured, he has nobody to blame but himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If, therefore, the <rs>British Consul</rs> and the <rs>British Admiral</rs> have in fact taken advantage of our peculiar situation to offer us such an outrage as that indicated, we hope it will be remembered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> We should think that so far from violating a plain principle of justice to inflict an injury upon us, the <rs>British Government</rs> would be rather pleased than otherwise by the supposed capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/><name>British</name> subjects are coining money by the carrying trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>All over the world they have driven, or are fast driving, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> entirely out of the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Nothing could be better calculated to add to the profile of this trade than the exploits of such a ship as <q>&#x0022; <unclear></unclear>&#x0022;</q> No merchant will ship on a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> as long as he can get an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs>, while <q>&#x0022;<num value="290">290</num>&#x0022;</q> is at tea. Now, the carrying trade is of such importance to the commerce of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> that it is believed <num value="1">one</num> main reason why the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have never been recognized is that it might lead to a war, and the consequent loss of the carrying trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>If, then, the <rs>Consul</rs> and the <rs>Admiral</rs> have done what the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> says they have done, it has been not only against law, as we understand it, but in contravention of the plain interest of their country. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>But it is not the design of the writer to indulge in eulogy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>That would be idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Eulogy of the dead is often sophistical, and designed to solace the feelings of relatives and friends; but, in the present case, to recount those virtues which adorned the life of the deceased, and which can only be properly appreciated by those of his own household, could but serve to increase the intensity of that pang which now lacerates a bereaved and widowed heart.
