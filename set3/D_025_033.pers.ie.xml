<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> A paragraph copied into this paper yesterday morning from the <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">World</hi></orgName> stated that <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> had ordered <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> and his men <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the <rs type="place">Cincinnati city</rs> prison, and afterwards &#x0022;to the <rs>Ohio</rs> penitentiary,&#x0022; adding these words, &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Where they are subjected to the indignity of having their heads stared.</hi>&#x0022;The question is, whether the <hi rend="italics">World</hi> asserts positively that the heads of these Confederates were shaved, or merely infers that as they are sent to the penitentiary that the shaving was a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It becomes a matter of national interest and of national duty to ascertain whether such an indignity has indeed been put upon our men. <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> is not too good to order this humiliation, and if he did so it adds but another to the many serious provocations to retaliation, and <num value="1">one</num>, too, that will arouse a deep feeling of indignation amongst the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>A prompt retaliation for such a treatment would be demanded by public sentiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The subjects for retaliation have been accumulating since the war, and thus far we have not retaliated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We have selected by lot <num value="2">two</num> men to be executed for the <num value="2">two</num> <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> Confederate officers put to death by <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>; but they are in confinement, and the day of their execution is not fixed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is, indeed, a painful duty, this of retaliation &mdash; involving the lives of innocent persons for the crimes of atrocious <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officials; but there is no other mods of throwing around our men in the enemy's hands the shield of the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; no other way to bring the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government to a sense of its obligation to conduct the war with some degree of respect for the usages of civilized warfare and the claims of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>No Government could exhibit a greater degree of forbearance than ours has exhibited on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It has delayed and postponed its measures of retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It has sought communication with the enemy, in the hope of avoiding them, only to be treated with contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It has taken some steps &mdash; such as outlawing <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> and <persName n="McNeal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:McNeal,nomatch:0"><surname>McNeal</surname></persName> &mdash; which were a kind of &#x0022; <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">brutum fulmen.</hi></foreign>&#x0022; The enemy, in the meantime, has gone on, neither relenting nor relaxing his atrocious cruelties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>How our Government is to postpone its measures of retaliation we cannot see. To speak at all of retaliating and not retaliate is to convince the enemy that we dare not retaliate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The brutalities of the enemy are subserving a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They are in this war to widen the breach and to assist in establishing that impassable gulf between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> which must forever prevent restoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They exhibit a species of madness which tyrannies and despotisms never fail to display towards a people struggling to throw them off. They are providentially introduced to make the separation and the deliverance more complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But they should be retaliated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The protection of those who bear the brunt of the war of resistance demand it. If allowed to be perpetrated by the enemy with impunity too long, it depresses the spirits of the soldier and suggests murmuring and discontent against the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The time when our Government should act has, beyond all question, it seems to us, come, and there ought not to be longer delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>When it comes to the shaving of heads it is most suggestive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The razor may be made to cut lower down still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If this does not awaken the head, why it might take indeed a long nap. </p> </div3>

<head>Deference to <name>English</name> opinion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> A contemporary remarks that the people of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> never know that they have done a thing right till they get the opinion of the <rs>English</rs> people on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Not long ago the same remark, in substance, was made of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by <num value="1">one</num> of the members of the <rs>British</rs> <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>As far as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are concerned, there is no doubt of its truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>And we fear that it is in some measure applicable to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Yet there was always this difference, that no touch of servility of flunkey I am ever characterized the undoubted respect in which <name>English</name> opinions have always been held here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No <name>English</name> notability was ever lionized in the <rs>South</rs>, except by a few tuft hunters, whereas in the <name>North Maryatt</name>, <persName n="Dickens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Dickens,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickens</surname></persName>, and all the other <name>English</name> celebrities, as well as <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> adventurers, that incomparable humbug, Kosauth, included, ran the people stark, staring mad. Southern respect for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in general has never failed to be self respecting, and is such as a proud, high-spirited people may naturally feel for an ancestry who cannot be disparaged without disparaging themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Nevertheless there have been too many exceptions to the rule of late, especially since the present war, and too much inclination to receive as oracles the criticisms of the <rs>English</rs> press upon all matters of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Perhaps it would be best to consult oracles less ignorant of the questions which they are expected to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>So far as slavery is concerned they not only do not know, but do not want to know, the truth; so far as relates to our mode of conducting the war, we are quite as competent to form an opinion as people <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure> off. If they are pleased to compliment Confederate valor, we suppose that it is because Confederate valor deserves the tribute, and it is neither more nor less meritorious because its victorious thunders waken echoes from all parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We would better show our admiration of <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> in emulating its pride than in feeling solicitude for its approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>For our own part, if there is <num value="1">one</num> thing more than another we respect in the <rs>English</rs>, it is their self respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They don't value the opinion of the rest of the world a great, so they have their own good opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is equally immaterial to them what France Germany, <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> or Timbuctoo thinks of them and their doings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They monopolize the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> philanthropy market, enslave Coolee and blew Sepoys from the months of their cannon with equal self-complacency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> could permit himself to suppose that he would ever feel the slightest degree of curiosity as to what the rest of mankind think of him and his proceedings, he would cease to be <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Way cannot his admirers on this continent imitate his example?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Why not manifest as profound indifference to his opinion of us as he does to our opinion of him? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> It is with nations as with men,--none but the self-respecting can command the respect of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>As a people, the <rs>South</rs> need fear no comparison with any other in genuine manhood, and public and private virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>As to morality, we doubt whether the equal of the <rs>Southern</rs> community can be found in any other prove that this is no idle boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In intelligence, piety, and domestic purity, courage, and even the sordid condition of material wealth, we have so reason to fear a comparison with any other nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><name>English</name> opinion on any subject ought to be a matter of no possible interest to us, not even on the subject of intervention; for if we cannot obtain our liberties unless they are given to us by the very empire from which we <unclear></unclear> them at the point of the sword, we are a degenerate race and fit only for slaves. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<head>Employment for disabled soldiers</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Wherever occupation can be found for disabled soldiers, either in public or private life, it ought to be given them in preference to any other class of men, native or foreign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The scandalous spectacle may be sometimes seen of able bodied foreigners employed in Government positions, or as overseers of plantations, and exempt from military duty on that account, whilst the wounded soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> seek in vain for employment and are at the verge of starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>No Government or people can prosper which permits such unnatural and monstrous ingratitude and injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The Scripture rule is as true of nations as of individuals &mdash; he who neglects his own household &#x0022;hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel,&#x0022; and how much more hideous, not only to neglect your own &mdash; those, too, who have suffered and bled for you &mdash; but to put aliens and perhaps secret enemies in their place, to take the children's bread and east it unto dogs. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> I isotones</hi>--<hi rend="italics">Subject:</hi> Are there any evidences in the <name>Scriptures</name> that the continent of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> is to be the locality upon which any of the great prophets dramas are to be performed ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> It was argued that it was not to be expected that we should find this continent, or the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, named and specified by their present geographical and history call names, in the <name>Scriptures</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>But as the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> power was clearly predicted by <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00123" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName> and other of the prophets in language that it is now seen cannot possibly apply to any other power, so <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> may be referred to in a similar manner, and the referenda thereto not recognized until the characteristic events are fully developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>But whether this be so or not it to clear that <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> in <rs type="role">Rev.</rs> <unclear>chap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/><num value="11">XI</num>, verse</unclear> <num value="8">8</num> plainly states that <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName>, <placeName reg="Egypt, Chickasaw, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056358">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName> were types and representatives of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, Also that <placeName reg="Babylon, Fulton, Illinois" key="tgn,2141868">Babylon</placeName> of old was used as a type of <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> civilization characterized as mystery, <placeName reg="Babylon, Fulton, Illinois" key="tgn,2141868">Babylon</placeName> the great the mother of harlots &#x0026;c. Hence as it is not reasonable to suppose that a political organization of such magnitude and importance as that which has taken place in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> would be overlooked and passed over in the purposes of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we may reasonably look for some ancient nation that has been set forth as a type and representative of this modern form of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>And in order to determine whether such a type exists, it was argued that the <name>Scriptures</name> originally divided society into <num value="2">two</num> great, clauses, namely: &#x0022;The need of the woman,&#x0022; or the just who live by faith; and the seed of the serpent, namely; All who live after the flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>That the need of the woman had <num value="3">three</num> great typical representative in the patriarchal fathers themselves, whilst the need of the serpent had <num value="2">two</num> great typical representatives in the patriarch family, namely: <unclear></unclear> and Esan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/><persName><foreName>Ishmael</foreName></persName> was a type of the children of bondage under the law, as well as of those in every other period of the world's history who have striven, by obedience to written law to make themselves acceptable to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> But Esan is the legitimate type of all those who claim the inherent possession of inalienable rights and who establish and defend those lame by their own swords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Thus the blessing of Esan enumerates his typical characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>(See <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> <num value="27">27</num>, Chap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/><unclear><num value="39">39</num> <num value="40">40</num></unclear>) These are as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="nobreak">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> and lastly: &#x0022;Esan hated <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName> because of the blessing where with his father blessed him.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> now, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> present a perfect anti-type to these distinguishing characteristics: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<item n="1"> <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>As to the productiveness of its soil and the fruitfulness of its fields, which have ever been the proud boast of all its children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> As to the source of its national existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/></item> </list> </q><bibl n="The United States"></bibl></cit> 
<p> Here it was argued that although it may be readily admitted that the original constitution of all human Governments may be traced to <num value="1">one</num> common source &mdash; the power of the sword &mdash; yet, since the establishment of the <rs>Politic Ecclesiastical</rs> constitution of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Empire, the power of might, or of the sword, has been at least <unclear></unclear> discarded, and the principle that <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName> rule by the grace of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Hence there was no antitype or national representative of Esan in the world until the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> revolution was an accomplished fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>For in it the claim to national life and existence was successfully maintained by the sword of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> Again it was argued that the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> typical characteristic finds its perfect antitype in the <name>Colonial</name> dependence of the original States wherein they literally served their brethren, but when they obtained the dominion they broke his yoke from their neck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> And, <unclear>lassly,</unclear> the persistent jealousy and haired of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which has over characterized the national disposition of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, together with the fact that both of the present Governments look upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> as their most fearful enemy, illustrates fully the anti-typical hatred of Esan toward his brother. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> The respond discourse illustrated the fact that the names of Esan's land and its principal cities in their import or meaning, were applicable to and characteristic of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government and country at the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>That this anti-typical Edom was to be the locality of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> <unclear>wine</unclear> press, and that it was demonstrable that there is no locality within the limits of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> empire that can be citied outside of the city, geographically, or outs do of its <unclear>Politice Hecle </unclear> organization, and, therefore, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the only locality which can be produced outside, or without the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> And that the organization of the democracy gathered out of <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> society on the anti-typical <unclear></unclear> Edom upon the principle that &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">the just powers of Government are derived from the concent of the governed</hi>&#x0022; constitutes the climax of unman rebellion and alienation from the life of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the natural, the indigenous growth of the serpent seed or earth power, and I therefore, what the <name>Scriptures</name> term &#x0022; <hi rend="italics">the vine of the earth</hi>&#x0022; That it is the ripened result &mdash; clusters on fruit of this vine &mdash; that are now being pressed out by the best of Him who, speaking in righteousness, travelleth in the greatness of His strength and &#x0022; <hi rend="italics">treadeth the winepress alons,</hi> and of the people there is not a <hi rend="italics">with him.</hi>&#x0022; Hence the ability to control the conflict so as to make peace is beyond the power of either belligerent; for He salth. &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">I will tread desert the people in mine <unclear></unclear> and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.</hi> &#x0022; and not until <unclear></unclear> his accomplished this will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>He be seen coming &#x0022;from Edom with dyed garments from B <unclear></unclear> glorious in His apparel&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> discourse illustrated the fact that in <dateStruct value="-01-24"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg="24">24</day></dateStruct> Jer. <num value="49">49</num> Just <num value="3">3</num> and other portions of the <name>Prophets</name>, there is a gathering of the nations and peoples of the entire world to and against Edom clearly predicted, which gathering never having had an accomplishment in the past or typical existence of Edom, must have its fulfillment in relation to end in the troubles of its antitype; which gathering to, and involving the nations of the world in the present troubles of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> will fully provide for the development of the occurrences to result from the outpouring of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> vial. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> discourse illustrated the teaching of the <name>Scriptures</name> in relation to the lake of fine and brimmers, and showed that a desolating war of long continuance, in which the monster guns and explosive and incendiary shells of the present day literally constitute the cause of action a lake of fire and brimstone.--That such a lake is spoken of in the judgment to be executed upon anti-typical Edom, at the time when all the nations shall be gathered together to it, to the battle of the great day of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> Almighty, and that therefore the battle of Armageddon, the <rs>Valley</rs> of <unclear></unclear> or the <rs type="place">Lake</rs> or Fire and Brimstone, <hi rend="italics">was to be looked for in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, the anti-type of Edom</hi> And as the <unclear></unclear> and the false Prophet were to be cast into it, at the be gaining of the <name>Millennium</name>, and the <rs>Dragon</rs> at the termination thereof, it must continue during the whole period of the <name>Millennium</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>That as the path cringe of the individual representatives of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations had been principally into the <rs>Northern States</rs>, so we might expect that to be the most likely location of the great national gathering that appears to be in the immediate future. </p>
