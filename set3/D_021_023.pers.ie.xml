<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> This day the army of the <orgName n="Department of Northern Virginia" type="department">department of Northern Virginia</orgName> has lost the services of a gentleman whose good name and deeds have been as familiar as <q>&#x0022;household words&#x0022;</q> to us. I allude to <persName n="Cabell,Major,W.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Cabell,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName>, than whom no army has seen a better man or more thoroughly qualified <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Quartermaster">Chief Quartermaster</rs>.--He brought to bear in the infancy of our campaign the experience of a well-tried practical officer, and laid the basis of a system in his department that has been happily recognized and appreciated by every man in our army, and in the important department which he controlled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><persName n="Cabell,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Cabell,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName>, after <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> or more of devoted service in this division, during which time he has made a host of friends and admirers, received official, and by the way <num value="1">one</num> of the stiffest and coldest notices, that he was relieved of duty here and transferred to our forces in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Perhaps the notice was strictly official and military, and it would not be <hi rend="italics">comme il faut</hi> to express any terms of appreciation of good service in it. However, what the notice did not convey, the good will of the <rs type="role" reg="junior-Officer">junior officers</rs> in the department of <persName n="Cabell,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Cabell,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName> did. Yesterday, learning of his departure to the seat of war in the <rs>West</rs>, these officers surprised the portly and independent <rs type="role2">Major</rs> by presenting him with an order for a full dress uniform of the most costly and superior character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This was alike a <hi rend="italics">suitable</hi> and <hi rend="italics">well-clothed</hi> compliment, which, I trust, the <rs>Major</rs> will long live to appreciate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>With the <rs>Major</rs>, <persName n="McR,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:McR,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>McR</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Self, and <persName n="McGibbon,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McGibbon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>McGibbon</surname></persName>, Assistant Quartermasters, leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They &mdash; a happier or more congenial trinity of gentlemen and officers I know not &mdash; also carry with them the regrets and good wishes of this army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> <persName n="Barbour,Major,A.,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Barbour,A.,M.,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Barbour</surname></persName>, a quiet and elegant gentleman whose devotion and activity in office augur well of his future benefit to this division, supersedes <persName n="Cabell,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Cabell,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The assistants to <persName n="Barbour,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Barbour,A.,M.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Barbour</surname></persName> are <persName n="Moore,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capts.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName> and <persName n="Young,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Young,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Young</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The former I only know, and if his official efficiency be only equal with his gentlemanly deportment and bland, inviting manners, then I can surely aver that everybody will be satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Such gentlemen, when experienced, make the department of the <name>Quartermasters</name> the greatest blessing to an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They can conceive and appreciate the wants of the soldier, and knowing their wants, readily and cheerfully make every effort to alleviate them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> In this connexion I cannot omit mentioning that a rumor prevails, regarding the transfer of <persName n="Fisher,Major,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Fisher,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName n="Thomas">Thos.</foreName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName>, post Quartermaster, at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, to <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This transfer, though it would confer a justly deserved and higher office, that of <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Quartermaster">Chief Quartermaster</rs>, on <persName n="Fisher,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Fisher,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName>, would, nevertheless, deprive us of <num value="1">one</num> of the best and most thoroughly qualified officers, in his department, that any army has ever had the good fortune to possess, intelligent, active, and affable, he has made himself generally beloved, and proved the good rule that puts the right man in the right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It may be selfish, and how few of our acts and wishes are minus <q>&#x0022;this potent ruler, self,&#x0022;</q> for us to wish <persName n="Fisher,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Fisher,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName> to remain here, when higher position awaits him elsewhere &mdash; still I hope the rumor is merely <num value="1">one</num> of those mercurial ones, which spreads into a <num value="1000">thousand</num> different directions and forms, by the merest touch of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I could dwell at length on the merits of the above gentlemen in their departments &mdash; point the improvements of their creation and the benefits accruing to our army therefrom, but it is enough to say that they give no encouragement to the appointing of those fungi, company or regimental understrapper quartermasters, who have no more ability to execute the duties of their offices than an elephant has power to open oysters with a quill tooth-pick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> In a late Northern paper whose chief news you have anticipated in your enterprising columns from your correspondent at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, I have seen an account of what is either foolishly or facetiously termed <q>&#x0022;the <hi rend="italics">battle</hi> at <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> Battle forsooth, A battle won by <q>&#x0022;the brave <persName n="Dunning,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Dunning,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Dunning</surname></persName> !&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>From all I learn of this affray as far as the fleet-footed <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs> were concerned, I would call it a foray of bloodthirsty, murdering, vandal incendiaries.--Leaving <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName> about midnight on the <dateStruct value="--6"><day reg="6">6th inst.</day></dateStruct> they marched in the most approved style of <q>&#x0022;forced rufflianism&#x0022;</q> towards Pleasant <persName n="Dale,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Dale,nomatch:0"><surname>Dale</surname></persName>, where they aroused the sleeping inhabitants by burning dwellings and barns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They applied the fiendish torch to the barn of <persName n="Nealis,Mister,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Nealis,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName n="George">Geo.</foreName> <surname>Nealis</surname></persName> and destroyed all his stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Passing through Pleasant <persName n="Dale,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Dale,nomatch:0"><surname>Dale</surname></persName> the next house they fired was that of <persName n="Albans,Mister,J.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Albans,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Albans</surname></persName>, situated at Terra Cotte, on the <rs type="place">Northwestern Turnpike</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Then they cheeringly burnt the house of <persName n="Haines,Mister,Daniel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Haines,Daniel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Haines</surname></persName>, near Terra Cotte, <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> to <placeName reg="Hanging Rock, Craig, Virginia" key="tgn,2374927">Hanging Rock</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Coming towards <placeName reg="Hanging Rock, Craig, Virginia" key="tgn,2374927">Hanging Rock</placeName> their dastardly march was impeded by the appearance of <persName n="Hardy,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Hardy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hardy</surname></persName>'s Little Capon Company, a small militia corps, who seeing the <num value="5000">5,000</num> or more <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs> made good their retirement, but not until the cowardly enemy became much alarmed and somewhat panic struck, as <q>&#x0022;the brave <persName n="Dunning,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Dunning,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Dunning</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> who is better acquainted with the yard-stick than the sword, fancied the entire march would be interrupted &mdash; his superior number giving him full sway and making him monarch of all around. </p>

<head>[for the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>.]<lb/>the sequestration law &mdash; its operation at the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> We propose briefly to discuss the <hi rend="italics">policy</hi> of the law, without reference to its <hi rend="italics">legality</hi> or <hi rend="italics">constitutionality,</hi> and to consider its operation on <hi rend="italics">friends</hi> and not on our Northern enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The <rs>North</rs> has little claim upon our indulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Indeed, there lies the trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Men who desire to retaliate upon the <rs>North</rs>, forget to look at the home effects of retaliatory legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We propose to show that the law is a sword with <num value="2">two</num> edges, and the <rs>Southern</rs> edge, perhaps, the sharper and more efficacious of the <num value="2">two</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and great characteristic of the law, its very essence and gist, is <hi rend="italics">to change a man's creditors.</hi> The creditor with whom he contracted is no longer the creditor with whom he must settle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>War, with its many disabilities and disadvantages, brought to debtors this <num value="1">one</num> relief &mdash; viz: exemption from suit by alien enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>By the act in question this relief is taken away, and the right to sue, which in the old creditor was in a beyance, is conferred on a new substitute creditor &mdash; the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This is the very gist, and principle, and bottom of the law. The loss of indulgence during the war &mdash; a period of peculiar exigency, when <hi rend="italics">time</hi> may make all the difference between solvency and insolvency &mdash; underlies the whole of it. Nor is this the only change in the legal status of the creditor.--The government &mdash; the new creditor &mdash; not only <hi rend="italics">may</hi> sue, but <hi rend="italics">must</hi> sue. It is a hard creditor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Its grasp, like that of machinery, is iron, inhuman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It cannot indulge, cannot compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It has no future customer to secure, nor reason for forbearance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> great hardship is in the change of <hi rend="italics">forum,</hi> or place in which suit is to be brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Suits and garnishments under the sequestration law are answered in the <rs type="place">Confederate Courts</rs> &mdash; not in the defendants' own county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This is no trifling hardship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>To conduct a litigation at a distance is exceedingly troublesome and expensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The Constitution of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and of some other States, and the legislation, perhaps, of most or all of the <name>States</name>, provides for administering justice in the county of <num value="1">one</num>'s residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Here, usually, are his witnesses; here his business is not neglected; here he has no expense of travelling back and forth; here are the lawyers who attend to his business and possess his confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>There are but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> Confederate Courts in a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In these all litigation meets &mdash; from <name>North</name>, <name>South</name>, <name>East</name>, and <name>West</name>, city or county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Merchants from other cities, villages, and the county, are all called to answer here, and, if there be litigation, to select new counsel, and provide for business at home during their own absence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> In the new forum judgment is rendered at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>At the close of the war the debtor must meet executions instead of notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The change of forum gives <hi rend="italics">priority</hi> to the <rs>Government</rs> (representing the <hi rend="italics">foreign</hi> creditor) over the <hi rend="italics">domestic creditor suing in the <rs type="place">State Courts</rs>.</hi> Thus, if the law be strictly administered, a <hi rend="italics">virtual lien is given to the foreign at the expense of the domestic creditor.</hi> While this is technically and theoretically true, the probability is that there will not practically be much left over after payment of sequestration expenses, wastage, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> <num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> obnoxious feature is the compulsory exposure of the debtor's affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>This act not only exposes the condition of his property, but (the surest means of precipitating others) brings the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suit.</hi> A garnishment is at best the most officious proceeding known to the law. It takes hold of those who have violated no law &mdash; nor made themselves amenable to process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Men usually have some choice of creditors, and frequently incur liabilities to <num value="1">one</num> creditor which they would have avoided with another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The present law, more officious than an ordinary garnishment, asks not merely for the debts due <num value="1">one</num> creditor, but for all due <num value="1">one</num> class of creditors &mdash; who, in the case of merchants are often almost their sole creditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It does not, as an ordinary garnishment, specify the creditor's name, but fishes the debtor's conscience to ascertain everything at once &mdash; name, debts, dates, and all. The information thus obtained in regard to all, is concentrated at head-quarters in each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Nay, the law inquires not only as to <num value="1">one</num>'s own debts, but as to <num value="1">one</num>'s knowledge of his neighbors, and makes each citizen as officious as itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>These proceedings tend to embarrass and often ruin men who would otherwise be able to work out of their difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The storm of war needs no such aggravations as these. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> The law, in the fourth place, is retro-action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Many payments made before its passage are regarded as null.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Settlements then made are disturbed and unmade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Payments to original creditors are required to be made over to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>These are terrible times in which to pay debts twice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>It may be said the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> payment should not have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>We will not discuss the law point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Whether the state of war only suspended the creditor's <hi rend="italics">right of suit,</hi> leaving the right of payment without suit at the option of the debtor, or whether the contrary doctrine is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But should not <hi rend="italics">notice to the debtor not to pay</hi> have been ample, actual and honest &mdash; given in a distinct and authentic form ? The state of war was not of itself such notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>If this were indeed an incident of such a state &mdash; many were utterly and bonafide ignorant of the fact &mdash; more than ordinary precantions were necessary between <num value="2">two</num> peoples so recently constituting <num value="1">one</num> people, into numerous relations and varied intercourse &mdash; Although ignorance of the law be no valid excuse in court, yet the law should never be made a <hi rend="italics">trap,</hi> but be well promulgated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>And in the policy of <hi rend="italics">government,</hi> legal fictions should not be confounded with actual fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The intercourse between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of what had recently been <num value="1">one</num> country could not be so instantly and completely sundered as that between nations always separate.-- <hi rend="italics">Our own Government</hi> for months <hi rend="italics">recognized this difficulty,</hi> by allowing the transportation of the mails, by the settlement of postmasters and contractors with the old Government, and by <hi rend="italics">numerous purchases made by itself.</hi> Telegrams still passed between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, railroad trains passed over the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The line itself was indefinite, and we hoped (and still hope) might reach higher, Co-partnerships &mdash; lawful in their inception &mdash; existed between citizens who, after the separation, were citizens of different countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Settlements were almost unavoidable necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The hard cases beyond measure which have thus arisen are numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Upon this feature of the law others have dwelt, and we pass it by, for to suggest it is to argue it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> There is great indefiniteness of information as to the extent of our wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>We do not know what proportion the wrong and remedy may bear to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It may turn out that <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> times as much has been seized (to the great detriment of Southern men) as was necessary to indemnify losses by confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Some provision would seem advisable to gauge the matter more thoroughly, and apportion the remedy to the evil.--Suppose, for example, that Southern sufferers by the confiscation act were authorized to proceed directly on their own behalf, and the course of procedure guided, by distinct reference to the least hardship upon other Southern citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>There is much room for discrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>In illustration of this, consider the relative position of trustees or corporations who <hi rend="italics">hold the property in kind</hi> of Northern men &mdash; as compared with men who simply <hi rend="italics">own money</hi> at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>A trustee holding <num value="10">ten</num> negroes would be relieved of liability by turning over to the receiver the <num value="10">ten</num> negroes, or a railroad or bank president, in whose company <num value="10">ten</num> shares of stock were held, need but turn over the <num value="10">ten</num> shares; but the debtor, whose debt <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> ago would have been paid by the sale of <num value="10">ten</num> negroes or <num value="10">ten</num> shares, would now have to sell <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Ruinous sacrifices would characterize the <num value="1">one</num> class, while the other is unaffected by the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Nor can the debtor class provide security by mortgaging the same amount of property as formerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The foregoing is <num value="1">one</num> illustration out of many of the necessity of greater discrimination in the law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> We deprecate the great fund for corruption furnished by this law in our own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>In its indefinite grasp, the expense, waste, corruption, and mismanagement, must be immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The object of the law is to provide <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, indemnity to our own citizens, and then, after payment of expenses, to pay over the balance, at the close of the war, to the original creditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The fund will, perhaps, be as well managed here as it would be in any other country; but the carcase is immense, and the eagles will be gathered together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The effects, both moral and political, must be extremely pernicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Corruption will creep in as into a full treasury very imperfectly guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Change the whole system of management of any large interest, and loss ensues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The public is at best a wretched administrator of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Here is a mass of scattered property of every description, with public sympathy hostile to the ultimate beneficiaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>What else can be expected than that a set of vampires will be engendered, whose occupation will be gone, unless, when this carcase has been exhausted, they can introduce corruption into the permanent administration of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>We confuse this is to us the most alarming future of this dangerous system. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> In the year <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> were <num value="1">one</num> country, hot <num value="2">two</num> countries at peace, but <num value="1">one</num> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Our intercourse was constant and prudigious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Our commerce was almost exclusively with the <rs type="place">Northern Bay</rs> bought by <unclear></unclear> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The native <unclear></unclear> or our <unclear></unclear> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> Their policy forced us to separate from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Our numberous creditors there, in accordance with the laws of war, forfeited during its continuance, the right to sue. The entire foreign debt of the country was, therefore, in abeyance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The Government now steps in, assuming the place of the foreign creditor, with this most important and intensely practical distinction, that whereas the <rs>Northern</rs> creditor <hi rend="italics">could</hi> not sue, the new creditor <hi rend="italics">must</hi> sue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> What a new phase this puts upon affairs ! What a mass of settlements, suits, and litigation ! And what must be the effect upon our debtor class of precipitating upon the country this huge mass of litigation ? Collections instead of being suspended, are made <hi rend="italics">closer</hi> than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>A new element of distress is imposed upon an already burdened society, not stopping with debtors to the <rs>North</rs> only, for indulgence denied to <num value="1">one</num> set of debtors is indulgence denied to others; enforced payment from <num value="1">one</num> is enforced payment from many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>This is a drastic, stringent physic to <sic>to</sic> purge the remotest ramifications of the body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>This ball, started by government, will crush <hi rend="italics">through</hi> from top to bottom of our social structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The process is this: Suit by goverment, representing with enlarged powers the foreign creditor; suit by domestic creditor, lest he be postponed; suit by merchant, that he may be ready to meet executions with executions &mdash; and these suits involving nearly all the indebtedness of the country, since our commerce was with the <rs>North</rs>, and debts arise mainly by commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>In a word, the law precipitates the country into a sea of litigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/><hi rend="italics">It is a violent stoppage of the credit system of the country, suddenly, in time of war.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> These are plain and common-sense views, which any man of business will appreciate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Let any <num value="1">one</num> in debt bring the matter home to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Suppose his creditor changed; anticipated indulgence withdrawn; himself compelled in hard times to disclose the amount of his indebtedness; his new creditor bound to sue; his answer to be given away from home; and he obliged in self-defence to sue others, that he may meet execution with execution, and he will thus see the operation of the law in a particular instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Let him suppose this state of things not confined to himself or his own locality, but made general, and he may acquire some faint conception of the general result, and of the sacrifices involved in a market glutted with property and void of money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> The force of these objections seem to have been appreciated, since the passage of the act, in high places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>So soon as the machinery was put into practical operation, it was felt to be too stringent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instructions issued as to the persons to whom interrogtories were to be addressed did not include merchants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>This was a significant commentary on the felt hardships of the law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> Not to dwell tediousty: <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has set the world a good example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> pays her debts to friend and foe, in peace and war.--What is the consequences ? An untarnished, lustrous credit, which enables her to borrow cheaper than any other power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>What would she gain by refusal ? A few dividends would be suspended &mdash; a mere nominal gain &mdash; in reality, a mere douceur to spite and national resentment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>But, her gains by payment are large and substantial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>She borrows at <num value="0.03">3 per cent.</num> instead of <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="6">6</num>, <num value="7">7</num>, <num value="8">8</num>, and <num value="10">10</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The whole difference lies in <hi rend="italics">the certainly</hi> of payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It grows not out of patriotism, but out of <hi rend="italics">confidence.</hi> She has established a character that is worth upon her national debt, say, <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of dollars or more annually, upon each billion of her debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>A glorious tribute to her good faith, and practical proof that honesty is policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> In the prosecution of this war we cannot follow the <rs>North</rs> into the crooked paths she is treading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>We cannot consent to abandon all obligation and all principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>We cannot trample upon the bonds of civilization and humanity, the laws of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, of men, and of nations, Self-respect and the respect of mankind, and not the example of the <rs>North</rs>, must be our guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>In our straitest emergency &mdash; in the extremest exigency of a war for existence, we hope and expect to maintain our independence against an unprincipled and dishonorable foe by honorable means alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>We cannot and will not be seduced into those devious ways into which our enemies, whithout even the plea of extremity, have already turned their footsteps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Our chief temptation will arise from the spirit of retaliation &mdash; from a sense of just indignation at their outrages upon law and propriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>But let us bide our time, do our duty, and leave vengeance to Him to whom it belongs, and who will in due time repay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>We have thus far been prospered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Their force has been repelled by hard fighting &mdash; their craft outwitted by plain, straight-forward honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Thus still must we gain the respect of mankind and thus retain our own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> The <rs>North</rs>, with unexampled prodigality, has wasted her patrimony of character, treasure, and respectability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Her heritage of liberty, of constitutional rights, and well checked and balanced machinery of government, has been already squandered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>But we, for our part, have others to deal with as well as the <rs>North</rs>.

<head>The military bills and the <name>Legislature</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> The attention of the <name>Legislature</name> has been for some time occupied with the subject of enlistments; but the progress made in maturiting the proper bills has not been equal to the demands of the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It is a subject for thought and action; it is emphatically a subject, not meet for tedious and windy debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The present Legislature should be characterized by great attention to and dispatch of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>We fear it is in a fair way of equalling its predecessors in loquacity, that most ill-timed of all indulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>These are times for earnest work; they are not the times for idle and tedious discussion, even of the most important subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>No man who has an idea worth presenting to a deliberative body, but can state it, conversationally, in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>; it is only those who wish to air their oratory that require to speak longer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> Oratory is at best a faculty of secondary importance; for the man of real ideas and purpose can generally impress them upon a deliberative body without the aid of declamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>To declaim is generally to consume time; and there are very few who possess the gift of eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>A great many attempt the performance without the warrant of genius, and their constant effort to soar upon the wings of oratory is a constant struggle with nature Like the effort of fowls in the barn yard, it is a mere flapping of wings, and beating of the air, accompanied by loud noises, but they never get their feet off the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> The Legislature should not be converted into a school of declamation; and prosy harrangue at the present session at least, should be coughed down without mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The military bills ought to have been perfected and enacted into laws long before this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The Legislature has been <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> in session, and no step has yet been taken towards enlisting an army in the <rs type="place">Spring</rs> for the service of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> That army ought now to be enlisted, and in process of organization for service by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> months of Spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>It ought to smell the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gunpowder that is burned, and become veterans in some degree before the <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> men are disbanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>It is well known that all troops have to pass through a period of disease on <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> going into camp; and our new levies should be enlisted in time to get through with this process before active service in the field is required of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> But why dwell upon these considerations, so obvious to all, and so painfully impressed upon the universal conviction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>There should be no further delay in the passage of laws looking to the recruiting of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Debate should be out down to <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>, and the bills should be taken up in a business like way, matured and enacted with the least delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The counsels of all should be freely invited; every idea should be presented that occurs to members; but it is a very poor and diluted idea that cannot be stated in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>.--Set speeches should be eschewed and out short, for they restrain debate and gag free discussion more than any possible rules limiting the length of speeches could do. It is absurd to hear a man whose habit of speaking enables him to spread a single common place idea over a <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> speech, denouncing a <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> rule as abridging the liberty of speech and the freedom of discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Sensible men could have presented <num value="24">two dozen</num> ideas, much more worthy of consideration to the <name>Legislature</name> in a <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> conversation each, while the declaimer is iterating his <num value="1">one</num> though in a <num value="100">hundred</num> different forms through a <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> harangue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> Long speeches put free discussion out of countenance and drive debate from the public halls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The presence of <num value="1">one</num> light head and restless tongue will silence a whole council of sages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The military bills now before our Legislature are measures peculiarly demanding the largest array of counsel and advice.--Every man should be encouraged and invited to express his views upon them; and yet, if the long-winded speakers who are so charmed with the sound of their own voices as never to be satisfied when they are silent, are permitted to engross the time of the <name>Assembly</name>, the very smallest stock of ideas possible will have been evoked upon the bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>To make the time of holding the floor so short that the member up is compelled to converse and forestalled from launching forth into vapid harangue, is to ensure a hearing to all, and to elicit the largest amount possible of counsel and suggestion on the subject in hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> We trust that the present week will not close without seeing a system of enlistments matured which will ensure the presence of an efficient army in the field by the opening of spring. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Peace.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> The blessings of a peace which is honorably gained and established on permanent foundations can only be appreciated by a people who have borne the trials and tribulations necessary to its accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>It is like health and all other blessings, only to be adequately estimated by those who have been deprived of it. But, like them also, to be worth anything, and to impart any solid satisfaction and comfort, it must be the result of no shallow and superficial treatment, such as affects only the surface, and leaves the source of disease untouched and ready to manifest itself again upon the slightest irritation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Peace, to yield permanent happiness and security, must be honorably achieved &mdash; worked out by a persevering and triumphant demonstraton of our ability to maintain our independence, even though it cost a longer war than that of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Such a peace will be sweet and glorious indeed, and all the more sweet and glorious that it has been accomplished by our own unaided valor and self-denial. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> It may well animate and encourage the hearts of all those now toiling and battling for the cause of independence, to look forward to such a result of their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>As the <name>Israelites</name> solaced their pilgrimage through the desert with the thoughts of the sweet fields of <placeName reg="Canaan, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063278">Canaan</placeName> beyond the swelling flood of <persName n="Jordan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Jordan,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jordan</surname></persName>, and as the <rs>Christian</rs> host, struggling amid the pitfalls and persecutions of a hostile world, look forward to <q>&#x0022;that rest which remaineth to the people of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,&#x0022;</q> so may the great, patriotic souls of this war for all that man holds dear, refresh themselves amid their mighty toils and solicitudes by enticipations of a peace which they can only gain by their own virtue and fortitude, and which though long delayed, will come at last if they are faithful to the end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>We shall be delivered from all future association in every shape and form, with the rascally, hypocritical, swindling, humbagging, wooden nutmeg making sons of the <name>Pilgrims</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>We shall have our own laws, literature, civilization, and sit under our own vine and fig tree with none to molest us or make us afraid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> And not the least gratifying result of peace will be its effects upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, whom it will leave high and dry, without a dime in its pocket or a friend on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>It will be at once the most impoverished and despised of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>It will be shut up to the cultivation of cod-fish and potatoes, and the contemplation of its own miraculous imbecility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Its people will spend their days in cheating <num value="1">one</num> another, and their nights in remose, that, in making war upon the <rs>South</rs>, they <q>&#x0022;cast away a pearl richer than all their tribe.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> This is an aspect of the invasion peculiarly agreeable to Northern imaginations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The idea of widows and children through a whole land raising the piteous cry of bereavement, is <num value="1">one</num> which all belligerents, except only the heavenly-minded people of the <rs>North</rs>, endeavor to hide from their own views and dismiss from their own contemplations as far as possible.--We have never heard, in all the wars of history, of an enemy who, however eager to annihilate the opposing combatants, ever solaced its imagination with the anticipated anguish of their desolated households.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>There is something in this consequence of war so distressing to the sternest heart that, so far from dwelling upon it with satisfaction, and much more speaking of it with pleasure, brave men steel their minds against the thought, or if it finds entrance there, it is only to melt their own souls in sorrow over the calamities upon the weak and dependent they are compelled to inflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>We do not believe there is a Southern man, we have not heard of <num value="1">one</num>, in the unrestrained freedom of private conversation, although the <rs>South</rs> is standing on the defensive, and engaged in the holy cause of protecting its own firesides and altars from desolation, express a sentiment so fiendish as that we have quoted from a Northern journal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>It is in keeping, however, with a race which has made women and children targets for its soldiery and victims of cruel imprisonment and outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Demoniac must be the nation which can look forward with exultation to the idea of weeping and lamentation more bitter than that of <placeName reg="Ramah, Lawrence, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101170">Ramah</placeName>, caused by the butchery of the brothers, sons, fathers, and husbands of a people whom they still claim as their own countrymen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>It is a splendid structure, and is so pleasing in appearance and so symetrical in contour, that I venture to give a slight description of it. Commencing at the bottom, then, I will say the extreme depth of the water, at mean tide is <measure n="25feet" type="distance">twenty-five feet</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Upon these piles are built <num value="3">three</num> massive piers, and <num value="2">two</num> abutments of hown granite, each block of stone having been laid with a diving bell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The extreme length of the bridge is <measure n="663feet" type="distance">six hundred and sixty-three feet</measure>, consisting of <num value="3">three</num> spans, each of <measure n="206feet" type="distance">two hundred and six feet</measure>, and <num value="1">one</num> drawbridge of <measure n="45feet" type="distance">forty-five feet</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The whole is a combination of cast iron bars and wrought iron braces, arrayed in a manner only to be understood after careful examination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/> The drawbridge is somewhat peculiar in construction: instead of the usual counter-balance, the centre of the bridge resting upon a pier, this swings on a pivot near <num value="1">one</num> end, and is supported by a gallows, which rises above it, the whole being anchored some distance beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The advantages of the plan are several.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>It will be readily seen that it gives an uninterrupted channel, the expense of a middle pier is done away with, there is greater lightness and increased mobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>It is, besides, less liable to get out of order than the ordinary counterbalance bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>This is <persName n="Frink,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Frink,nomatch:0"><surname>Frink</surname></persName>'s patent, and was erected in the years <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> and &#x0027;<num value="56">56</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/> The beauty, lightness, and, at the same time the solid appearance of this bridge is a subject of general remark, and is an example to what perfection the science of bridge building has been brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/><num value="1">One</num> need scarcely look into the writings of ancient authors on engineering for a description of primitive bridges, for their origin is easily discovered in the teachings of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>The stepping-stone lying upon the bottom of shallow streams, with planks stretched from <num value="1">one</num> to another, demonstrates the principles of piers and arches which science has brought to such a degree of perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>In deeper rivers an accumulation of stones forms a larger and stronger pier, and when these were built close enough together the ancients were accustomed to form a roadway with long slabs of stone, after the manner of the <name>Virtruvian</name> architrone of the primitive <placeName reg="Tuscan temple">Tuscan temple</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The <rs>Greeks</rs> seem to have known very little of bridge building, but the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> carried the science to a great extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>To them alone, of all the ancient nations, belonged the power of rearing the lofty, massive arch and </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>They are found to be durable, safe, and less expensive than others,--the only objection laying in the expansion and contraction of the material by being exposed to different extremes of temperature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Modern skill has, however, overcome this difficulty, and now they are looked upon as the best and most desirable bridges in use. This science, which has been brought to such perfection in these latter days, is by no means as simple as many suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>The construction of a small bridge may be an easy process, while that of a larger <num value="1">one</num> may be extremely difficult; for the strength of the material does not increase with its weight, and there are limits beyond which no structure could be carried and withstand its own gravity.--But, enough of this, as I am not writing an essay on bridge-building, but merely putting down a few random thoughts which presented themselves while standing before <persName n="Frink,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="mostcommon:Frink,nomatch:0"><surname>Frink</surname></persName>'s patent suspension bridge over the east branch of the <placeName key="tgn,1123695" n="1.000 3" reg="elizabeth, virginia, united states">Elizabeth river</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/> Rain, snow, sleet, mist, fog, mud, and the state of the weather generally, have for the time being, monopolized conversation to the exclusion of that everlasting topic <q>&#x0022;the advance and the expected battle.&#x0022;</q> Since this miserable spell of weather set in the subject has been quietly laid aside; and, as it is the time since last <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, that a week has gone <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by without a rumor of the <rs>Federal</rs> force advancing, and it being such a great piece of news not to hear it, I concluded to send it to the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> hoping its readers will feel very grateful to hear such a piece of intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>A trip down to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> last week was quite an event, considering the state the roads are in now, but I felt amply repaid by the hearty greetings of my friends, and the opportunity I had of noting the change in the scene since I last travelled over the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The old tents, in some cases dilapidated, mildewed, and weather beaten, which had stood the storms and sunshines of the summer campaign, have given place to comfortable cabins, which have quite an air of neatness and home comfort, with their stick and plaster chimneys, and their <num value="1">one</num> window of <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="4">four</num> lights, and their new plank door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>In some cases the ends of the logs are sawed off, and the little villages look quite habitable until you cast a glance down at the <hi rend="italics">pavement.</hi> To supply the windows, of course every deserted house between <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> and the outside of the lines had to furnish its quota.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>In this connexion an anecdote is related of an old lady, who took her knitting and went off to spend the afternoon with a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Great was her consternation upon returning to find her house minus the windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>As no smoke was coming from the chimney it was drawn upon as deserted property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/> Everything about <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> has an air of activity, business and bustle; even the old buildings seem to have brightened up and put on an air of importance as much as to say: <q>&#x0022;I am, or I was headquarters.&#x0022;</q> Now another incident and I am done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Even in this vicinity we have frequent visits from the <q>&#x0022;noble soldiers,&#x0022;</q> as mine host, a meek, unsuspicious, invalid minister of the gospel, calls them, and many a meal, bundle of straw and other kindness they receive from him; and his faith in them could not be shaken by such instances as the following, until a day or <num value="2">two</num> ago: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/><rs n="Soldier 1">Soldier No. 1</rs> dropped in to get his dinner, depositing his gloves, coat, and bucket of butter, just purchases, on the hall table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>When the family and soldier <num value="1">No. 1</num> came in, the other had disappeared; also gloves and bucket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>This led to some suspicion, and search was made to see if anything else was missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>It was soon discovered that a small morocoo bag, containing a porte monnale with <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure>, was also gone, belonging to the lady of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Mine host moralized on the frailty of man in general, and the delinquency of this noble soldier in particular, and contented himself by quoting-- </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/> which is literally true, in these days of shin-plas'ers; but still, as this trash could very well help to supply numerous household comforts, the good lady was not so easily won over to the philosophy of the quotation.
