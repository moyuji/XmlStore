<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> As early as <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> the ladies thronged the various entrances to the <rs type="place">Institute building</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>and when the doors were opened a struggle look place of an exciting, but somewhat amusing character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>After a good deal of compression, a little shrieking, and much laughing, the &#x0022;advanced guard&#x0022; of femininity poured into the <rs type="place">Hall</rs>, and quickly filled the ladies' gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Hundreds of others continued to arrive completely blocking up the front passage, and through the lower hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>As many were admitted as could be accommodated with seats, and many more turned away from the <rs type="place">Hall</rs>, some with sorrow and others with indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The rush of the &#x0022;sovereign people&#x0022; was not so great, because those who were minus tickets generally thought it useless to assemble where they were not invited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Notwithstanding all the precautions, however, there was considerable confusion in the lobby, which at <num value="1">one</num> moment, seemed likely to result in knock-down arguments. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> In the name of the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, he expressed sentiments of admiration and esteem for the ancient and renowned Commonwealth of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Nothing that concerned her honor failed to create a deep interest in his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He recognized in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> the leader in the great struggle for independence, as well as in the great work which united the people in the adoption of a Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He alluded to the unexampled munificence of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in the bestowal upon the <rs>Government</rs> of that great Territory which had become the seat of empire, but which, he regretted to say, was the seat of much that was hostile to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>When his State was compelled to server her connexion with the <rs>Government</rs>, it was with the hope of being joined with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> at no distant day, in a Union under happier auspices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If doomed to disappointment, it would be a source of infinite regret to his people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> He did not design, in whatever he might say of the enemies of our institutions, to include that great body of conservative people at the <rs>North</rs> who had manfully stood by us. He should ever remember with gratitude their struggles to maintain the <rs>Union</rs> as it was governed by our fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>His remarks would apply to those who have persistently assailed Southern rights and Southern honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> On the <date value="11-29">29th of November,</date> the <name>Legislature</name> of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, by a unanimous vote, called a Convention of the people of the <rs>State</rs>, to take into consideration their relations with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and adopt such measures of protection and redress as the circumstances might demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The Legislature also adopted resolutions setting forth a catalogue of vevancis, and suggesting such remedies as the people ought to adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>These resolutions did not grow out of the fact that a Northern man was elected to the <name>Presidency</name>, and that the <rs>South</rs> was to be excluded from all there in the government, but out of the fact that the <rs>North</rs> had declared war upon our institutions, and a purpose to destroy them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The Convention assembled at <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> on the <date value="01-07">7th of January,</date> and on the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="2">9th</day></dateStruct>, by an overwhelming majority, proceeded to adopt an ordinance of secession, by which <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> dissolved her connection with those people who had dishonored her, without the hope expectation, or wish of ever being restated, and with a purpose to hold them as her enemies in war, but in peace her friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Another clause in the ordinance expressed her wish to form a Union with all those States which might secede, upon the basis of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> As early as the <date value="1860-02-10">10th of February, 1860,</date> the <name>Legislature</name> had adopted a resolution in effect that the election of a President by the votes of <num value="1">one</num> section, upon the ground that there is in irrepressible conflict between free and slave labor, and of an avowed hostility to the <rs>South</rs>, would justify the <rs>South</rs> in taking measures of consultation, and in proposing a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The <rs>North</rs> had ample warning that it was through their own reckless folly and madness that the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> would be shattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But in defiance of this, and of evidence accumulated from a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other sources, they proceeded to nominate a candidate, who, though not the most distinguished among them, was still a true representative of their principles of hostility to Southern institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The speaker then reviewed the acts of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party, alluding to their avowals of war upon the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, leading to its eventual abolition in the <name>States</name> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>As a part of the history of the controversy, he read from a speech of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>, quoting his opinion that the slavery agitation would never cease till a crisis was reached and passed; that the <rs>Government</rs> could not permanently endure while half slave and half free; and that he did not believe the house would ever be divided, but expected it would eventually be all free or all slave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> This was the avowed principle of the party who elected a President by a large majority in the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In defiance of all the purposes for which the <rs>Government</rs> was founded instead of protecting all, it was to become our for and trample our rights and sacred honor beneath its iron heel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We, the descendants of the <name>Revolutionary</name> patriots, were expected to bend our necks to receive the yoke, and were expected to solace ourselves with the land delusion that the foe would some day cause its hostilities and that all would be well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We, of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, are no longer under that delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The song of the siren is no longer in our cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We have finally made up our minds to preserve our rights and our honor-- to take our destiny in our own hands, and never surrender it to our implacable foes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The speaker then alluded to the outrage on the soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; when, in an hour of fancied security and supposed peace, this Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>distinguished for her unwavering fealty to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, was made the seem of a foray by ruffians from among our national enemies of the <rs>North</rs>, to light up the fine of insurrection, and give up the wives and children of the citizens to the assassin's knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It is true the expedition failed; the slaves proved loyal the dignity of the <rs>State</rs> was exonerated, and the criminals forfeited their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But it had no effect on the party at the <rs>North</rs> now about to be inaugurated into power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He had no purpose to arouse the feelings of his hearers by his reference to the <rs>John Brown</rs> raid, but spoke of it as <num value="1">one</num> of the effects of misplaced confidence; to show that it is the principle of the <rs>North</rs> to war upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people; and to warn the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> of what they must expect when the party shall have fully established its dominion over them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> These were some of the cause which had impelled the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> to take her Destiny in her own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>She had clung to the <rs>Union</rs> long after its obligations had been violated under the fond hope that her rights would be restored under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.--Long and vainly had she hoped that every section of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> would recognize the rights of all, and that they might continue together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Could we have believed the evil temporary, we might still have hopes; but the present state of things is the sure result of the growth of false teachings in the <rs>Northern</rs> section of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> He then gave a history of the <name>Abolition</name> aggression, beginning with the <rs>Missouri</rs> controversy, and read the language of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, <measure n="40years" type="date">40 years</measure> ago, showing that he regarded that as the knell of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Then traced it through subsequent years of disregard of constitutional obligations, until it terminated in the irrepressible conflict, of which a <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> <rs type="role2">President</rs> and his party were about to reap the benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But the <rs>South</rs> could place herself beyond its power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He did not mean to argue the question of the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>That question had, with his people, passed beyond the field of argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If the right be not in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> knew there was a higher law &mdash; not the higher law of their foes --but the higher law of the people's power, when they put the lance in its rest and decide the issue in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>When the <rs>North</rs> shall make up its mind to coerce us, we shall meet the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He hoped for peace in all sections, and trusted that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> would so ordain that the friends of liberty throughout the world should not have to mourn over the madness and folly of a conflict of arms on this continent; but if war must come, they were preparing for it, and the <rs>Southern</rs> people would meet it with firmness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The justice of their cause was a tower of strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>When the hour comes (he continued) we know, however you may dread to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> and all its revered associations, where <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will then be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Her sons will bear the banner of the <rs>South</rs> aloft, and their blood will enrich every field in defence of her honor and sacred rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> Circumstances have demonstrated that the <rs>South</rs> should take her destiny in her own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>No brave people would ever place its honor and its property in the hands of a Government where hostility to them is the law of administration &mdash; a Government not founded on the policy of equal rights, but on the policy of hatred to the <rs>South</rs> and her institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>We are not opposed to the principle of a confederated Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It was no fault of ours that a form of confederation with the <rs>Northern States</rs> ceased to be desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>What, then is the remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It is that which we have adopted: a <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName> with common hopes and common interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The destiny of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">South</rs> Virginia</placeName> now holds in her hands.--Let <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> take her stand by her Southern sisters, and the revolution will be a peaceful <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Grim-visaged war will smooth his wrinkled front, and we shall no longer hear of the despotic power of coercion by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/><placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and the other border States will take their stand by <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, We shall then have a united South, with <num value="15">fifteen</num> stars on our banner, and a territory more compact and more desirable than <num value="1">one</num> with the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>We shall have a great Southern Republic, where faction will cease to trouble us, and where liberty and prosperity will take up their permanent abode &mdash; a Republic to which we may safely entrust our interests and the interests of posterity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> In concluding, the speaker, in the name of the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, renewed his expressions of admiration for this State and her people, and urged their co-operation in the great movement now going on; hoped they would come out from the house of their enemies and take a place in the house of their friends and kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>They wanted the advice and counsel of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>If she came to them, her arrival would raise a shout of congratulation which would echo and re-echo from the shores of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Benning,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Benning,Henry,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benning</surname></persName></hi> said he had been appointed by the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">Convention of the State of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName></orgName> to present her ordinance of secession, and to invite <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, through this Convention, to join <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and the other seceded States in forming a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>This was the whole extent of his mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>He had no power to make or to receive promises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Still, a proper respect for this Convention required that he should explain the reasons which induced <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> to take the step of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>He would, therefore, lay before them some facts and considerations in favor of the acceptance of the invitation by <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> What were the reasons for <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>'s secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>A deep and settled conviction, on her part, that a separation from the <rs>North</rs> was the only thing that could prevent the abolition of her slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>This was the main cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>He maintained that it was true, that unless there was such a separation slavery would be finally abolished in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>In the first place, the <rs>North</rs> hates slavery &mdash; hates it willingly, and hates it intentionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>An administration was about to be inaugurated founded upon this hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>To satisfy any mind that might doubt this proposition, he then read a few sentences from a speech delivered by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, in <date value="1858-10"> October, 1858,</date> wherein he said that he always hated slavery as much as any Abolitionist; that he was always an old line <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>; and that if he was in Congress he would vote for the abolition of slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>These were pregnant sentences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Hatred of slavery as extreme as hatred can exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>His political principle is that his action against slavery is not to be restrained by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, even as interpreted by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>This is the sentiment of the chosen leader of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Can you doubt that it is entertained by every solitary man of that party?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He is the representative man &mdash; his sentiments are the sentiments of his party &mdash; his principles are their principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It is true that the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party hates slavery, and the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> majority in the <rs>North</rs> is equivalent to the whole, for the voice of the minority is drowned when the majority is permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The part is so deeply seated in the <rs>North</rs> that it cannot be overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>It has the press, the pulpit, the school- houses, the <name>Legislatures</name>, the <rs>State Governments</rs>, the <name>Magistrates</name>, the <name>Constables</name> &mdash; in fact, all official life &mdash; and it now has the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>In addition, it has an inexhaustible reserve to fall back upon and recruit from &mdash; a reserve that believes slavery is a moral and social evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>It is also in alliance with the tariff, internal improvement and <orgName n="Pacific Railroad" type="railroad">Pacific Railroad</orgName> schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It cannot be overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>You might as well try to lift a mountain out of its bed and pitch it into the sea. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> But suppose the party were overcome &mdash; how long would the victory last?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The fragments might get into a majority &mdash; but the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, he argued, would soon again get the power, and come down upon its opponents like an avalanche, crushing them by its weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> cannot be put down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>It is to be the permanent dominant party at the <rs>North</rs>, and thus we were authorized to conclude that the <rs>North</rs> hates slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The whole people there regard it as a moral and social evil, and in the course of events, it would merge from passive into active hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>In the past, the <rs>North</rs> invariably exerted against slavery the whole amount of power which it had to exert.--They abolished it in the magnificent empire which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> presented them in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, and in every State and Territory North of <num value="3630">36,30</num>; then endeavored to put the <rs>Wilmot Proviso</rs> on all other Territories of the <rs>Union</rs>, and succeeded in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>They had taken all that was acquired by the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war, and appropriated it to the free country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>They do all they can to make negroes free &mdash; maltreat their pursuers, and make raids to murder all classes and sexes; and when the chief perpetrator is caught and punished, half the <rs>North</rs> goes into mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>If any of the perpetrators escape, they are shielded by the law. This is what they have done against slavery &mdash; they have always done what they could to put it under the ban in Christendom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> We had a right to argue from the past to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>If the <rs>North</rs> has done all it could in the past, so it will in the future, and if it can, will abolish slavery in the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The speaker alluded to the fact that the <rs>North</rs> is constantly acquiring the power to abolish slavery by the acquisition of new States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The public territory is practically Northern territory, and every State that comes in will be a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/><placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> should satisfy every <num value="1">one</num> of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>These additions will go very near to bringing the power of the <rs>North</rs> high enough to change the <rs>Constitution</rs> so as to suit their own views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>There is also a process going on by which some of the slave States are becoming free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>In some the slave property is on the decrease.--The census shows this to be the case in <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and in other States on the same parallel the relative increase and decrease is against the slave population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The anti-slavery feeling is so predominant in the <rs>North</rs>, that owners of slaves in these States feel that their property is doomed, and they haste to get rid of it. Thus it goes down lower, until it all gets into the pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Under the weight now pressing on this property, it is bound to go into the <rs>Cotton States</rs>, and he feared the day was not distant when they would be the only slave States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The <rs>North</rs> obtaining the power, will amend the <rs>Constitution</rs> and abolish slavery &mdash; and say if the masters resist they shall be hung for it. The <rs>North</rs> is acquiring this power, as the past has shown; and if causes are allowed to operate as they now operate, slavery is to be abolished in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and the other Cotton States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The speaker alluded at length to the eventual result of anti-slavery aggressions, and argued that if the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> entered into any compromise, recognizing slavery South of any line of latitude, it would be broken; for the people of the <rs>North</rs> regard slavery as an agreement with death, and a compact with the devil; and to violate it, would be a part of their religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>They are entirely beyond the pale of contract making, and hold it to be right to violate anything that violates their higher law. He contended that the <rs>South</rs> could get no remedy for this disease in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>A separation from the <rs>North</rs> would be a complete remedy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The Personal Liberty Bills and the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had much to do with the action of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The Personal Liberty bills were direct, deliberate infractions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>They gave the <rs>South</rs> the right to say she would no longer be bound by the <rs>Constitution</rs> if she chose to say so. A bargain broken on <num value="1">one</num> side is broken on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was the occasion <rs>Georgia</rs> chose to select. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The speaker went on to show that it would be to the material, social, religious and political interest of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to unite with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>He spoke of the value of the cotton crop, and its rapid increase yearly &mdash; of the sugar, rice, naval stores, and other staple productions. --With their immense surplus, amounting to <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> to <measure n="230000000dollars" type="currency">$230,000,000</measure> annually, the <rs>Cotton States</rs> purchase their articles of consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Very little of this was spent at home. --He then went on to urge <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to take the place of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and New York, in <rs n="furnishing goods" type="product">furnishing goods</rs> for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>She would have it if she separated from the <rs>North</rs>, and with the same protection that has built up the manufactories in that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He believed that the <rs>Southern Government</rs> would guarantee full protection, but if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> wants more, let her come in a proper spirit to the <orgName n="Southern Congress" type="congress">Southern Congress</orgName>, and it would be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>This point was urged at considerable length, and with much force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> In alluding to the fugitive slave evil, the speaker said the indirect effect of the loss of a slave was to make the people of the border States distrust slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The policy of the <rs>South</rs> would be to station a line of police along the border to prevent their escape, and to have a surveillance on persons coming over, as well as on suspicious persons on this side of the border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Experience had shown that statutes for the return of fugitives were worthless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> With regard to the <name>Territorial</name> evil, he said the <rs>South</rs> would never get <num value="1">one</num> foot of the new territory so long as she stayed in the <rs>Union</rs>.--If she goes out, she can get it, and slavery could go there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>If <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> unites with the <rs>South</rs>, she will have all these things in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Cotton is peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It is an article of indispensable necessity in all the great nations of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Unless we have peace, they cannot get it. But suppose <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> joins the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>She encounters a competition which will destroy her manufactures.--In consequence the <rs>North</rs> has an advantage which she can never overtake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Agriculture will be stationary, and cannot flourish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>She will lose her slaves, and get no return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>And rivalry will create a constant danger of war. Thus the <rs>South</rs> presents a much more attractive bill of entertainment in material advantages than the <rs>North</rs>; while in moral, social and religious advantages, the <rs>South</rs> had every inducement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The speaker went on to allude to the probability of a confederacy on the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs> at no distant day. The antagonism of interests would increase the dangers of the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The Northern Confederacy might start beautifully, but it had within itself the elements of decay, and would go to pieces.--Then the <rs>South</rs> would become the <rs>Empire</rs>.--After anarchy had held sway for awhile, they would come to us and ask for what we could concede to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>We could impose our own terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>We would have nothing to do but sit down and let our territory grow and expand like an oak tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Then, with cotton as our safeguard, we should have peace with all the great nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>In the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will stand at the head, and be looked up to.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> He blinded to the future possibility of <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Douglas,,Fred,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="default:Douglas,Fred,,,"><foreName>Fred</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>--<num value="1">one</num> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s runaway negroes &mdash; being elected to the <name>Presidency</name> <num value="1000">Thousands</num> of men at the <rs>North</rs>, in their hatred for slavery, were ready to do this thing to humiliate the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Give him war, pestilence, famine, anything sooner than that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> With regard to the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade, he said emphatically that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> had done all it could to dispel the illusion in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The South would never open the trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>There never was a greater delusion than a contrary belief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> On the <rs>Free Trade</rs> question, he said it was the purpose of the <rs>Southern Government</rs> to support itself by duties on imports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>A large majority of the members at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> were in favor of such a measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice President</rs> takes this ground, and think <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> would be sufficient to support the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> As to the prohibition of inter-State slave trade, he said it was true this was in the power of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>If <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> goes with the <rs>North</rs> he thought it would be prohibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Whatever the <rs>South</rs> could do in that respect, under such circumstances, she would do. This, however, was not a threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>He believed if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> joined the <rs>South</rs>, it would not be done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> It had been said that the seceded States went out without giving the border States an invitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>In this respect the position occupied by the <rs>Cotton States</rs> towards each other, and that occupied towards the border States, were the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Each State acted by herself, and acted promptly, in order to be prepared for the great event of the <date value="03-04">4th of March.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/></date> It was a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>They could not afford to wait. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> He did not feel that their case was desperate, even if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> refused to unite with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>They had <num value="5000000">5,000,000</num> people; had arms and ammunition; had a prospective arrangement with foreign Governments; and above all, they had a cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Their cause would save them against the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They most earnestly desired the co-operation of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and if she refused, they would receive it more in sorrow than in anger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Greater than we once went to his own, and his own received him not; yet he became a great light, illuming all the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> As he took his seat, there was a hearty demonstration of applause. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>For days they obtained only water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>A hole <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> square was dug in the ground around the mouth of the well, and into it the oil was allowed to flow from the conductor, which it did without spouting, and in a quiet, orderly way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In this way <hi rend="italics"><measure n="400barrels" type="mass">four hundred barrels</measure> were filled in <measure n="10hours" type="date">ten hours</measure>.</hi> During this period the well was stopped up half the time, in consequence of the inability of the hands to secure the oil as fast as it flowed, and even when running, a large iron plunger, <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> in diameter, was kept in the well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Had this been taken out, the yield of oil from this single well must have been full a <measure n="100barrels" type="mass">hundred barrels</measure> an hour. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/> Our present condition has been achieved in a manner unprecedented in the history of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>It illustrates the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Idea that Governments rest upon the consent of the governed, and that the people may alter and abolish Governments whenever they become destructive of the ends for which they were established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The declared purpose of the compact of Union, from which we have withdrawn, was to establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the general defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity; and when, in the judgments of the sovereign States now composing the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it has been perverted from the purpose for which it was ordained, and ceased to answer the ends for which it was established, a peaceful appeal to the ballot box has declared that, so far as they were concerned, the <rs>Government</rs> created by that compact should cease to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>In this they merely asserted the right which the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> defined to be inalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The time and occasion for its exercise, they, as sovereigns, were final judges, each for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>This impartial and enlightened verdict, maintained, will vindicate the rectitude of our conduct, and He who knows the hearts of men will judge of the sincerity with which we labored to preserve the <rs>Government</rs> of our fathers in its spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>This right, solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the <name>States</name>, and which has been affirmed and reaffirmed in the bills of rights of States, and subsequently admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>, of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, undeniably recognizes in the people the power to resume the authority delegated for purposes of Government.-- Thus the sovereign States here represented proceeded from this Confederacy, and it is by an abuse of language that their act has been denominated revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>They have formed a new alliance, but within each State the right of government has remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The rights of person and property have not been disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The agent through whom they communicated with foreign nations is changed, but this does not necessarily interrupt their international relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Sustained by the consciousness that the transition from the former Union to the present Confederacy has not proceeded from a disregard on our part of just obligations, or any failure to perform every constitutional duty, moved by no interest or passion to invade the rights of others, anxious to cultivate peace and commerce with all nations, if we may not hope to avoid war, we may at least expect that posterity will acquit us of having needlessly engaged in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/> Doubly justified by the absence of wrong on our part, and by wanton aggression on the part of others, there can be no cause to doubt, that the courage and patriotism of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will be found equal to any measure of defence which a sense of security may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>An agricultural people, whose chief interest is export of a commodity required in every manufacturing country, our true policy is peace and free trade which all our necessities will permit.--It is alike our interests, and that of all those to whom we would sell, and from whom we would buy, that there should be the fewest practicable restrictions upon the interchange of commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>There can be but little rivalry between ours and any manufacturing or navigating community, such as the <rs>Northeastern States</rs> of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>It must follow, therefore, that mutual interest would invite good will and kind offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>If, however, passion or lust for dominion should cloud the judgment or inflame the ambition of those States, we must prepare to meet the emergency, and maintain by the final arbitrament of the sword the position we have assumed among the nations of the earth. </p> <cit><bibl n="Davis"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/> We have entered upon a career of independence which must be inflexibly pursued.-- Through many years of controversy with our late associates &mdash; the <rs>Northern States</rs>--we have vainly endeavored to secure tranquility and obtain respect for rights to which we were entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>As a necessity &mdash; not choice &mdash; we have resorted to the remedy of separation, and henceforth our inquiries must be directed to the conduct of our own affairs and the perpetuity of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> which we have formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>If a just perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably to pursue our separate political career, my most earnest desire will have been fulfilled; but if this be denied us, and the integrity of our territory or jurisdiction be assailed, it will but remain for as with firm resolve to appeal to arms and invoke the blessing of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> in a just cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/> As a consequence of our new condition, and with a view to meet anticipated wants, it will be necessary to provide a speedy and efficient organization of branches of the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive Department</orgName>, having special charge of foreign intercourse, finance, military affairs and postal service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>For purposes of defence, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> may, under ordinary circumstances, rely mainly on their militia; but it is deemed advisable, under the present condition of affairs, that there should be a well instructed and disciplined army more numerous than would be usually required in a peace establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>I also suggest, for the protection of our harbors and commerce on the high seas, a navy adapted to that object will be required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/> With a Constitution differing only from that of our fathers in sofar as it is explanatory of their well known intent, treed from sectional conflicts which have interfered with the pursuit of the general welfare, it is not unreasonable to expect that the <name>States</name> from which we have recently parted may seek to unite their fortunes with ours, under the government we have instituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>For this your Constitution makes adequate provisions; but beyond this, if I mistake not, the judgment and will of the people is that a union with the <name>States</name> from which we have separated is neither practicable nor desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>To increase power, to develop resources and promote the happiness of our Confederacy, it is requisite that there should be so much of homogeneity that the welfare of every portion be the aim of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Where this does not exist, antagonisms are on gendered, which must and should result in separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Actuated solely by a desire to preserve our own rights and promote our own welfare, the separation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has been marked by on aggression upon others and followed by no domestic convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Our domestic pursuits have received no check, the cultivation of our fields has progressed as heretofore, and even should we be involved in war, there would be no considerable diminution in the production of the staples which have constituted our exports and in which the commercial world has an interest scarcely less than our own. This common interest of produce and consumer can only be intercepted by exterior force, which should obstruct its transmission to foreign markets &mdash; a course of conduct which would be as unjust towards us as it would be detrimental to manufacturing and commercial interests abroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> Should reason guide the action of the <rs>Government</rs> from which we have separated, a policy so detrimental to the civilized world, the <rs>Northern States</rs> included, could not be dictated by even the stronger desire to inflict injury upon us. But if otherwise, a terrible responsibility will rest upon it, and the sufferings of <num value="1000000">millions</num> to the folly and wickedness of our aggressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>In the meantime, there will remain to us, besides the ordinary remedies before suggested, the well-known source of retaliation upon the commerce of an enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> Experience, in public stations of an inferior grade to that which your kindness has conferred, </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/> has taught me that care, and toll, and disappointments are the price of official elevation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>You will see many errors to forgive, and many deficiencies to tolerate, but you shall not find in me either a want of fidelity to the cause that is to me the highest in hope and dearest in affection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> Your generosity has bestowed on me an undeserved distinction--<num value="1">one</num> that I neither sought nor desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Upon the continuance of that sentiment, and upon your wisdom and patriotism, I rely, to direct and support me in the performance of the duty required at my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>We have changed the constituent parts, but not the system of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The Constitution formed by our fathers is that of these Confederated States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>In their exposition of it, and in judicial constructions it has received, we have a light which reveals its true meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Thus instructed as to the true interpretations of that instrument, and ever remembering that all offices are but trusts, held for the people, and that delegated powers are to be strictly construed, I will hope, by due diligence in the performance of my duties, though I may disappoint your expectations, yet to retain, when retiring, something of the good will and confidence which welcomes my entrance into office. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/> It is joyous, in the midst of perilous times, to look around upon people United in heart, where <num value="1">one</num> purpose of high resolve animates and actuates the whole; where the sacrifices to be made are not weighed in the balance against honor, right, liberty and equality.-- Obstructions may retard, but they cannot long prevent the progress of a movement sanctified by justice and sustained by a virtuous people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> Reverently, let us invoke the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of our fathers to guide and protect us in our efforts to perpetuate the principles which, by His blessing, they were able to vindicate, establish and transmit to their posterity, and, with a continuance of His favor, ever gratefully acknowledged, we may hopefully look forward to Success, to Peace, and to Prosperity. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> I stopped <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName>'s mouth with a kiss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>I declined her offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>I would not listen to it. In fact, my pride was up in arms, and I felt I would rather pass the night in the church-yard itself than accept a proposal dictated, I felt sure, by the notion that my nerves were shaken by the ghostly lore we had been raking up, that I was a weak, superstitions creature, unable to pass a night in a strange chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>So I would not listen to <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName>, but kissed her, bade her good-night, and went on my way laughing, to show my light heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Yet, as I looked back in the dark corridor, and saw the friendly door still ajar, the yellow bar of light still crossing from wall to wall, the sweet, kind face still peering after me from amid its clustering curls, I felt a thrill of sympathy, a wish to return, a yearning after human love and companionship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>False shame was strongest, and conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>I waved a gay adieu.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>I turned the corner and peeping over my shoulder, I saw the door close; the bar of yellow light was there no longer in the darkness of the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>I thought, at that instant, that I heard a heavy sigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>I looked sharply round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>No <num value="1">one</num> was there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>No door was open, yet I fancied, and fancied with a wonderful vividness, that I did hear an actual sigh breathed not far off, and plainly distinguishable from the groan of the sycamore branches, as the wind tossed them to and fro in the outer blackness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>If ever a mortal's good angel had cause to sigh for sorrow, not sin, mine had cause to mourn that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>But imagination plays us strange tricks, and my nervous system was not over-composed, or very fitted for judicial analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>I had to go through the picture-gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>I had never entered this apartment by candle light before, and I was struck by the gloomy array of tall portraits, gazing moodily from the canvas on the lozenge-paned or painted windows, which rattled to the blast as it swept howling by. Many of the faces looked stern, and very different from their daylight expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>In others, a furtive flickering smile seemed to mock me, as my candle illumined them; and in all, the eyes, as usual with artistic portraits, seemed to follow my motions with a scrutiny and an interest the more marked for the apathetic immovability of the other features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>I felt ill at ease under this stony gaze, though conscious how absurd were my apprehensions; and I called up a smile and an air of mirth, more as if acting a part under the eyes of human beings, than of their mere shadows on the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>I even laughed as I confronted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>No echo had my short-lived laughter but from the hollow armor and arching roof, and I continued on my way in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>I have spoken of the armor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Indeed, there was a fine collection of plate and mail, for my father was an enthusiastic antiquary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>In especial there were <num value="2">two</num> suits of black armor, erect, and surmounted by helmets with closed visors, which stood as if <num value="2">two</num> <unclear>mailed</unclear> champions were guarding the gallery and its treasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>I had often seen these, of course, but never by night, and never when my whole organization was so over wrong at and tremulous as it then was.-- As I approached the <rs>Black Knights</rs>, as we had dubbed them, a wild notion seized on me that the figures moved, that men were concealed in the hollow shells which had once been borne in battle and tourney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>I knew the idea was childish, yet I approached in irrational alarm, and fancied I absolutely beheld eyes glaring on me from the eyelet-holes in the visors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>I passed them by, and then my excited fancy told me that the figures were following me with stealthy strides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>I heard a clatter of steel, caused, I am sure, by some more violent gust of wind sweeping the gallery through the crevices of the old windows, and with a smothered shriek I rushed to the door, opened it, darted out, and clapped it to with a bang that re-echoed through the whole wing of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Then by a sudden and not uncommon revulsion of feeling, I shook off my aimless terrors, blushed at my weakness, and sought my chamber, only too glad that I had been the only witness of my late tremors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>As I entered my chamber, I thought I heard something stir in the neglected lumber-room, which was the only neighboring apartment.--But I was determined to have no more panics, and resolutely shut my ears to this slight and transient noise, which had nothing unnatural in it; for surely, between rats and wind, an old manor-house on a stormy night needs no sprites to disturb it. So I entered my room, and rang for my maid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>As I did so, I looked around me, and a most unaccountable repugnance to my temporary abode came over me, in spite of my efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>It was no more to be shaken off than a chill is to be shaken off when we enter some damp cave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>And, rely upon it, the feeling of dislike and apprehension with which we regard, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight, certain places and people, was not implanted in us without some wholesome purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>I grant it is irrational &mdash; mere animal instinct &mdash; but is not instinct <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> gift, and is it for us to despise it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>It is by instinct that children know their friends from their enemies &mdash; that they distinguish with such unerring accuracy between those who like them and those who only flatter and hate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Dogs do the same; they will fawn on <num value="1">one</num> person, they slink snarling from another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Show me a man whom children and dogs shrink from, and I will show you a false, bad man &mdash; lies on his lips, and murder at his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>No; let none despise the heaven-sent gift of innate antipathy, which makes the horse quall when the lion crouches in the thicket-- which makes the cattle scent the shambles from afar, and low in terror and disgust as their nostrils snuff the blood-polluted air. I felt this antipathy strongly as I looked around me in my new sleeping-room, and yet I could find no reasonable pretext for my dislike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>A very good room it was, after all, now that the green damask curtains were drawn, the fire burning bright and clear, candles burning on the mantelpiece, and the various familiar articles of toilet arranged as usual.--The bed, too, looked peaceful and inviting -- a pretty little white bed, not at all the gaunt funereal sort of couch which haunted apartments generally contain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>My maid entered, and assisted me to lay aside the dress and ornaments I had worn, and arranged my hair, as usual, prattling the while, in <persName><foreName>Abigail</foreName></persName> fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>I seldom cared to converse with servants; but on that night a sort of dread of being left alone-- a longing to keep some human being near me &mdash; possessed me, and I encouraged the girl to gossip, so that her duties took her half an hour longer to get through than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>At last, however, she had done all that could be done, and all my questions were answered, and my orders for the morrow reiterated and vowed obedience to, and the clock on the turret struck <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Then <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, yawning a little, asked if I wanted anything more, and I was obliged to answer No, for very shame's sake; and she went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>The shut-ting of the door, gently as it was closed, affected me unpleasantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>I took a dislike to the curtains, the tapestry, the dingy pictures &mdash; everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>I hated the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>I felt a temptation to put on a cloak, run, half-dressed, to my sister's chamber, and say I had changed my mind, and come for shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>But they must be asleep, I thought, and I could not be so unkind as to wake them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>I said my prayers with unusual earnestness and a heavy heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>I extinguished the candles, and was just about to lay my head on my pillow, when the idea seized me that I would fasten the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>The candles were extinguished, but the fire-light was amply sufficient to guide me. I gained the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>There was a lock, but it was rusty or hampered; my utmost strength could not turn the key. The bolt was broken and worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Baulked of my intention, I consoled myself by remembering that I had never had need of fastenings yet, and returned to my bed. I lay awake for a good while, watching the red glow of the burning coals in the grate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>I was quiet now, and more composed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Even the light gossip of the maid, full of petty human cares and joys, had done me good &mdash; diverted my thoughts from brooding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>I was on the point of dropping asleep, when I was twice disturbed.--Once, by an owl, hooting in the ivy outside-- no unaccustomed sound, but harsh and melancholy; once, by a long and mournful howling set up by the mastiff, chained in the yard beyond the wing I occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>A long-drawn, lugubrious howling, was this latter, and much such a note as the vulgar declare to herald a death in the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>This was a fancy I had never shared; but yet I could not help feeling that the dog's mournful moans were sad, and expressive of terror, not at all like his fierce, honest bark of anger, but rather as if something evil and unwonted were abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>But soon I fell asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>How long I slept, I never knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>I awoke at once, with that abrupt start which we all know well and which carries us in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> from utter unconsciousness to the full use of our faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>The fire was still burning, but was very low, and half the room or more was in deep shadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>I knew, I felt, that some person or thing was in the room, although nothing unusual was to be seen by the feeble light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Yet it was a sense of danger that had aroused me from slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>I experienced, while yet asleep, the chill and shock of sudden alarm, and I knew, even in the act of throwing off sleep like a mantle, <hi rend="italics">why</hi> I awoke, and that some intruder was present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Yet, though I listened intently, no sound was audible, except the faint murmur of the fire,--the dropping of a cinder from the bars &mdash; the loud, irregular beatings of my own heart. </p>
