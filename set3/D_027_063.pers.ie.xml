<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are little aware of the extent to which the country has been imposed upon in the matter of details and exemptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>From good authority, we learn that an immense army &mdash; an army which, if enrolled, disciplined, and led by proper officers and a proper general, would be able to plant the <rs>Southern</rs> cross on the spires of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> before the ides of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>--an army of <num value="114000">one hundred and fourteen thousand</num> men &mdash; seeks, and has secured, exemption from service as agriculturists &mdash; sneaking under that plea out of the defence of their country &mdash; leaving under that plea others to fight their battles for them &mdash; good Confederates, brave patriots, worthy citizens, delighted to hear of the brave deeds of our gallant army, provided they be not called on to share in the glory, willing to be free, provided it cost them nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/><num value="114000">One hundred and fourteen thousand</num> men detailed as agriculturists, and all these of conscript age, in a population of <num value="5000000">five millions</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Oh shame, where is thy blush?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Add to these the <num value="32000">thirty-two thousand</num> State officers alluded to by us yesterday, and we have an army of <num value="146000">one hundred and forty-six thousand</num> men; and these are far from being all.--The details for various mechanical operations amount to an enormous number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>In many instances these so-called mechanics are no mechanics at all. Less wise than Hamlet assumed to be, let the wind blow from what quarter it may, they do not &#x0022;know a hawk from a handsaw.&#x0022; They are mechanics for the occasion &mdash; that is, to escape the enrolling officer &mdash; and they cease to be mechanics the moment the danger disappears. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> If the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> take this thing in hand, it will do nothing but extend the limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>That will not answer the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The country wants young men, and must have them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>There is a plenty of them for all the purposes of this war, and they must be brought out. Old men are useful to a certain extent, and so are boys; but they are not fit to fight out such a war as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Besides, there is no sense in allowing these fellows to skulk in this way. Why, in the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> alone there are <num value="18000">eighteen thousand</num> men detailed for agricultural purposes &mdash; that is, to avoid service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The State Legislatures must take hold of this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Here in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> we have a most active and untiring Governor &mdash; a man of judgment as well as zeal &mdash; a man who is a soldier himself, and feels for the soldier as all ought to do,--a man whose influence with the <name>Legislature</name> is deservedly high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We hope everything from his zeal and intelligence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> While upon this subject, we wish to remove an impression, which has become very general, with regard to the operations of the <rs type="place">Bureau of Conscription</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It is to the effect that Bureau has not extended its operations as far as it ought to have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>That is a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It has manipulated nearly every man of conscript age in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>It has brought him forward and placed him in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>If he is not found there, it is no fault of the <rs type="place">Conscript Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>That office has finished with him, and washed its hands of him. The fault lies elsewhere &mdash; in those, namely, who grant these unlimited details and exemptions; thereby impairing our sources of defence and seriously imperilling the liberties of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Those <num value="114000">one hundred and fourteen thousand</num>, of which we have just spoken, and those <num value="32000">thirty-two thousand</num>, of whom we spoke yesterday,--all enjoying themselves at home while the enemy is moving heaven and earth to subjugate us &mdash; have all passed through the hands of the enrolling officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>There is not a bit of original matter in the whole mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Is it not strange that we should be wanting reinforcements at a time like this, when the <rs type="place">Bureau of Conscription</rs> has placed such immense resources of men in reach of the <rs>Government</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Placed them where it has, or ought to have, nothing to do but to lay its hands upon them! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> We close this article by introducing the subjoined remarks of the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel, </hi> yesterday morning, in an article upon the same subject: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> &#x0022;It is necessary for the recruiting officers to use increased diligence and firmness; and it is necessary that the people everywhere sustain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The man who is at home, though embraced by the call to the field and to his country's defence, is a disgraced man. Every day that he waits for the conscript officer to take him by the collar and drag him to his post is a day of shame and disgrace to himself and to his family and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Let all such men join the army without a moment's delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Let parents send them; let friends persuade them; and let the ladies drive them, if need be. There are many portions of the country in which hundreds of recruits could be readily obtained if the officers and the people would do their duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> &#x0022;If the young men do not come out to the defence of their country &mdash; if they hide behind little offices, or hide behind the military lines, or hide under a horse-mail contract, or skulk in any way,--then it will devolve upon the old men to defend the youngsters, and take the places in the army which these ought to fill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If the young men will not fight, the old men must, and, thank Heaven, they will; and what a shame it will be, what an everlasting infamy that those to whom the country naturally looks for its defence, should leave the duty to be performed by their fathers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>If the need be, these men must come out, too. <orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> must be defended at whatever cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>This is every man's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty; and none, we are persuaded, will respond to it with greater resolution than our reserve forces, if the exigencies of the campaign should summon them to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Young or old, we must all be ready to come the instant we are called for; and come forward with cheerfulness, and zeal, and courage, and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will favor us with his blessing, and our country shall be preserved.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> The indiscriminate application of the term <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to our enemies in the field does not convey an accurate idea of the elements of power which are combined against us. In a mere war of sections &mdash; that is, a war between the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> proper and the <rs>Southern States</rs>--not even <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves could have expected triumph.

It is a war between the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the latter having all the wealth and all the military and civil organizations of the old government on its side, with immense armies, composed of all nations, and of which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> proper constitute only a small proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Of its native troops, the best are the mixed races of the <rs>West</rs> and renegade <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckian</rs> and Missourian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Even in the navy, its most successful officer is <persName n="Farragut,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><surname>Farragut</surname></persName>, a Tennessean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>A large number of its officers, in both the land and sea service, are natives of Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Nor is it accurate to designate all the people of the <rs>Middle States</rs> even as <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It may suit the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> proper very well to have all their elements of strength classed as <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, but it is not the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>As a general thing, they have staid at home during the war, making money out of battles which they do not fight, and gaining a great reputation for prowess besides, by the designation of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, which is uniformly applied to <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>It may be convenient to give our enemies a name which condenses in <num value="1">one</num> word all that is hateful; but the worst of them are the least injured by its application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We are helping <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> to go down to posterity as a great heroic character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> It is doing indifferent justice to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> capacities of invention to accuse them simply of lying in their accounts of battles and other events of this war.--It falls as far short of their merits as to say of <persName n="King,,Tom,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="default:King,Tom,,,"><foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>King</surname></persName> and <persName n="Heenan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Heenan,nomatch:0"><surname>Heenan</surname></persName> that they are men of pugnacity, and to take no note of their science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>They not only lie, but know how to do it. They not only lie generally, but lie in detail, and they so manipulate and color the details that scarcely any <num value="1">one</num>, not an eye-witness of the events they relate, can question the truth of the narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>In their account of the fight at Reame's station they manifest inventive genius of the highest order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>It is the testimony of our plain, unimaginative Confederate soldiers that, on that occasion the enemy fought with much loss spirit than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> account is spirited enough, if the fight was not. It gives, as usual, many circumstances, clothing the dry bones with such an illusion of flesh and blood that anybody might imagine it a living thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We hear of repulse after repulse of our troops, and all the minuti&#x00E6; are given, so that there can be no mistake about it. The conduct of their new levies is made an object of apparent censure and indirect praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They were too rash at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and too timid at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Their native bravery requires the chastening hand of time and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Their inexperience, and the overwhelming numbers of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, lost the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>There must be always somebody to blame; either negro troops or new <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> levies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The &#x0022;overwhelming numbers&#x0022; of the <rs>Confederates</rs> is another point, never to be omitted, from the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Notwithstanding all we have heard of the depleted condition of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, the rebellion on its last legs, &#x0026;c., it makes its appearance in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> year of the war in the same &#x0022;overwhelming numbers&#x0022; which have gained all our victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>This is the only defect in the otherwise artistic excellence of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts of battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Either the rebel armies are not so short of men as they represent, or the &#x0022;overwhelming numbers&#x0022; cannot even seem to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The Northern masses will ask if, after losing a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, and fighting <measure n="3.5years" type="date">three years and a half</measure>, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> can still bring into the field &#x0022;overwhelming numbers,&#x0022; how long must the war go on, how many more multitudes be slaughtered, before the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> will cease to have this advantage ! </p>
