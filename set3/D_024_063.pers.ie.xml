<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> Our white troops, when ordered out to salute the colored officer of the day, refused to obey the order, and laid down their arms.--The officers and privates of the <orgName type="regiment" key="13MERegiment">13th Maine regiment</orgName> would pay no regard to the colored officer, and threatened his life if he attempted to coerce them into obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>I hear that <num value="4">four</num> officers have sent in their resignations on account of this unpleasant state of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>There is no need of appointing negro commissioned officers, while we have so many white veterans, willing and perfectly competent, doubly so more than the colored officers, and most negroes prefer white men for their superior officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> The rule of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName> which has prevailed for the last <num value="25">twenty five</num> or <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, has been not only despotic, but extravagant in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>As <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="19">XIX</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>said, &#x0022;I am the <rs>State</rs>,&#x0022; Cotton said, &#x0022;I am alt.&#x0022; Not only was every other branch of industry neglected for the cultivation of the cotton field, but everything was permitted to go to waste which might have been saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Indeed, the neglect of all industrial enterprises rendered much of, this waste unavoidable, materials being allowed to perish because there was no provision for making them up into useful forms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> The most wholesale waste of which our people have been guilty, is that of the timber, which; by <num value="1000">thousands</num> of across every year, has been girdled and suffered to decay on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>There has been an excuse for this in the fact that the immense area of fresh land, the clearing of which was made necessary by the rapid immigration into the fertile States of the <rs>Southwest</rs>, could be cleared into other way; besides which, it may be admitted that the timber was not loss, being returned to the soil as it decayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>This excuse would be more valid, had not the style of cultivation been extremely wasteful itself &mdash; impoverishing the land and requiring new clearings to be constantly made; but that is no excuse for our people permitting themselves to be dependent upon importation for the vast amount of soap consumed by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>It is time that this should cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>By felling, piling and burning the timber, ashes enough could be cared not only to supply all the waste of the country, but to constructs a valuable article of export.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>On large plantations and at country villages and cross-roads, potash manufactories could be established all over the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> It is unnecessary to remark that the manufacture of soap should keep pace with that of potash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The large amount of animal food consumed by our population tells the story of a great waste of grease which would thus be economized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> The tallow of the beeves consumed in the country would furnish all the candles that the country requires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>In the absence of steering manufactories, beeswax, an abundance of which is annually wasted, could be used to give them a proper hardness, and practice would soon render housewives export in the manufacture of an excellent article from these materials. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> It is hardly necessary at present to allude to the waste of hides; we rather think that these are now carefully saved everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Had more care been taken of them formerly, the home manufacture of leather would be a regular business, and the sudden pressure upon it would not have carried prices to such an exorbitant figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Every discouragement, however, has been thrown in the way of this, as of all other manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The difficulty of procuring not only hides, but bark, has deterred many a man from undertaking it. In connection with the economizing of timber, the preservation of bark should be strongly enforced upon planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Let this once become the general rule, and tanneries would be multiplied throughout the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> Hides and tallow are not the only products of slaughtered animals which should be husbanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The borns and the bones are too valuable to be neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>There may be no manufactories of comb, buttons cutlery, &#x0026;c., at present in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to consume these, but it is not too soon to save them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>We may any week hear &mdash; and it is high time we should hear &mdash; of such works being established, and when they are, their products will be cheaper the better the supply of raw material the manufacturers find accessible to commence on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> Deer horns, which are too rarely preserved, should also be taken care of, as we have known them to be in some instances; a <num value="1000">thousand</num> pair or so having been shipped from <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> in <num value="1">one</num> consignment <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> We are so destitute of chemical works that it seems hardly worth while to suggest the saving of blood &mdash; the principal material for the manufacture of Prussian blue &mdash; which from its perishable character, besides, can hardly be utilized except in cities, where it can be conveyed immediately to the manufactory.--There may be some method of preserving it for transportation, but no chemist, that we know of, has made any suggestions on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>There are other substances, however, which are employed in the manufacture of Prussian blue; every kind of animal material indeed is used for this purpose &mdash; such as old leather, woolen, hair &#x0026;c. Let such things be thrown aside into some shag corner; they may be called for. Phosphors, too, we omitted to remark, is made from house, and such as are not suitable for making buttons and knife handles can be used for this purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> The hoots, scraps of hide and tendonous parts of slaughtered animals are of great importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Enough of these are constantly wasted to furnish all the glue necessary for any purpose short of reconstructing the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> The feathers of all fowls should be saved.--Hen's feathers are not to valuable, it is true, as those of geese, but they are too good to throw away and those, if not employed for filling beds and pillows, could be quilted into comforts to supply at home the place of the blankets sent to our brave boys in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> Cotton and linen rags, waste cotton, old bagging and rope, have been wasted to the amount of quite a <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure> a year in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.--With the present high price of paper, there can be no pretence that they are not worth caving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Every country trader should offer a fair equivalent for them and accumulate the savings of his neighborhood, to be disposed of at the nearest paper mill; not as a speculation &mdash; that passion for speculation, and contempt for whatever does not yield a large profit, is what kills all useful enterprises here &mdash; but to oblige his customers by enabling them to convert into money what, without his assistance, would be lost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> Finally, every fragment of wrought or cast iron and old brace should be preserved, and when a sufficient quantity has accumulated, disposed of. It is but fair, however, that manufacturers should be willing to pay a remunerating price for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>When <rs n="scrap iron" type="product">scrap iron</rs> was advertised for in this city last summer, many housekeepers collected lots of a dozen or <measure n="20l." type="pounds"><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure> of what had been lying about their promises; but on learning that only a cent or half a cent a pound would be paid for it, they took no further steps in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Hundreds of pounds might have been obtained if those who advertised for it would have paid the expense of picking it up and dry age to the wharf. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> These are a few items which it has occurred to us to bring to the notice of our readers, to whom no doubt others will suggest themselves, which, if attended to, would prove a direct saving of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars to the country, besides the effect they would have of lowering the price of many important articles of consumption.-- <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Mobile Advertiser" type="newspaper">Mobile Advertiser</orgName>.</hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> Writing can be more absurd and disserting than the lordly contempt occasionally affected by police politicians for the newspaper press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The Press is a power in every State--a power scarcely <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> a constitutional Governments to that of the throne <unclear></unclear>. The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London Times</orgName> wields on influence in Christendom each as no single statesmen of this age exerts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The Press of the <rs>South</rs> has been the life and breath of this Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It may have committed errors in the beginning of the war, but these are attributable to the novelty of a state of things which led others into error besides the <name>Press</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>With these exceptions, it is impossible to over-estimate the impetus which <unclear></unclear> Southern movement has derived from the <name>Press</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It has aroused the patriotism, encouraged the hopes, nerved the hearts, and strengthened the arms of the people of the <rs>South</rs> throughout this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It has pointed out dangers to be avoided, called attention to the necessity of economy and retrenchment, stimulated the agricultural interests, and <unclear></unclear> abuses in the administration of affairs with unsparing fidelity and boldness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/><num value="10000">Ten thousand</num> such politicians as undertake to denounce this powerful organ of public sentiment could not accomplish as much for the public interest as a single press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The Press has no motive to be otherwise than just and honest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The public interests are its interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But the interests of politicians do not always harmonize with those of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Their personal elevation not the public good, is the object of their lives, and if necessary, the public will have to give way to self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>What harm have not politicians gone to human society!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>They have corrupted the people, sacrificed principle and honor, and lighted the flames of war itself, for the purpose of advancing their ambitious projects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>They will ruin our own country, if they are permitted to attain ascendancy in her councils, which they can never do till they have muzzled the <name>Press</name>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> To put every grain of corn in the field, everything that can supply food for man and beast, is the grand duty of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We are pained to hear the elaborate preparations making in some portions of the country for the cultivation of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If this prevails to any considerable extent it is idle to shut our eyes to the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>A people without bread, an army without bread, and what is our fate!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>What the dismal and inevitable result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Can any <num value="1">one</num> contemplate it without horror? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> We do not need more men in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Our great aim should be to feed those who are there. --By improvidence, waste, and mismanagement, we have diminished resources which at <num value="1">one</num> period appeared to be inexhaustible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Now we can only supply our wants by strict economy, and provide for the future by producing as much food as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>In the benignant Heaven above and the productive earth beneath are our hope and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>No other friends have we, none other, if we are true to them and to ourselves, do we need in the wide universe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> But we must save, and economize, and labor.--We must make every foot of ground available. --We must cultivate the earth as closely as in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where not an atom of the soil is wasted.--Every grain of the soil is a grain of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It is gold dust, or may be made such on which we tread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The idea, at such an hour, of cultivating cotton and tobacco!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The man is a public enemy who does it. Who is to buy his cotton and tobacco?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>He is starving his neighbors without feeding himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He is starving the defenders of his country, and giving to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> the most substantial aid and comfort, he can ever expect to command in the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>If we are true to ourselves we can set the usurper at defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>But let us sacrifice selfishness and avarice in all its phases upon the altar of the public good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Let us consecrate the soil to the support of the army and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> It is a wise rule never to &#x0022;underrate an enemy,&#x0022; but, if you fight him at all, to fight him with every power of body and mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is an equally wise rule not to overrate him, lest despair should relax the energies as much as over-confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>In the beginning of this contest we did not give the <rs>North</rs> credit for its fighting capacities, and, from that extreme, we are in danger of rushing to another &mdash; that of over-estimating its resources in money and men. We have never believed that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had half the men in the field the lying Northern newspapers pretended.
