<head>The Demonstration in New York</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We notice more fully in our paper of this morning the proceedings of the immense meetings of citizens in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, on the subject of the arrest and sentence of <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,Clement,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The spirit and resolves of that meeting were bold and decided so far as words can make them; whether they will be sustained hereafter remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In the language of the <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">World</hi></orgName>, &#x0022;the gaunt&#x0022; let thrown down in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> has been taken up &#x0022;in New York.&#x0022; But the taking up is the mere prelude to the contest which, if the <name>Administration</name> makes no concession, and those who composed this meeting are firm, must in due time be brought about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>For ourselves we acknowledge we put little faith in these men; for, although they were very positive in their assertion of what they called their own civil rights, they took care to credit themselves with a large amount of patriotism and devotion to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, for furnishing liberally men and means to crush the rebellion in the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Even <persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Seymour,Horatio,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName>--who declares that if the arrest and trial of <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,Clement,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> were approved by the <name>Administration</name>, and sustained by the people, it &#x0022;establishes military despotism&#x0022;--says, <q>&#x0022;having given it (the <name>Administration</name>) a generous support in the conduct of &#x0022;the war, we pause to see what kind of Government it is for which we are asked to pour out our blood and our treasures,&#x0022;</q> and he continues to say, that its action in <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,Clement,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName>'s case &#x0022;will determine in the minds of more than &#x0022;<num value="0.5">one half</num> the people of the loyal States whether this war is waged to put down rebellion at the <rs>South</rs> or destroy free institutions at &#x0022;the <rs>North</rs>.&#x0022; In other words, whether it is to enslave the <rs>South</rs> or enslave the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If it is only to enslave the <rs>South</rs>, why <persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Seymour,Horatio,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> is willing to go on &mdash; according to the <name>Administration</name>--&#x0022;a generous support in &#x0022;its conduct of the war;&#x0022; but if to &#x0022;destroy &#x0022;the free institutions at the <rs>North</rs>,&#x0022; he'll none of it &mdash; there must be resistance! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> So, too, with <persName n="Hunt,Mister,Washington,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Hunt,Washington,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Washington</foreName> <surname>Hunt</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He says: <q>&#x0022;It is for the perpetuation of free constitutional Government, and for this only, that the country has been so willing to exhaust its best blood and place its vast resources at the disposal of the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people should allow the strength thus imparted to be turned against themselves, and a military despotism erected on the ruins of public liberty!&#x0022;</q> So, so!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is all right so long as the despotism is marshalling its hosts against the liberties of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><persName n="Hunt,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Hunt,Washington,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunt</surname></persName> and his co-laborers will contribute their &#x0022;best blood&#x0022; and the vast resources of the country for that meritorious purpose but &#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid!&#x0022; he exclaims, that &#x0022;the strength thus imparted&#x0022; should be turned against the <rs>Northern</rs> people themselves! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> What do these people mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Is there <num value="1">one</num> kind of liberty for them and another for us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><num value="1">One</num> kind of justice for them and another for us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Or are we unworthy to be free, and they too good to be slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>How can they coolly and unblushingly applaud the invasion of the <rs>South</rs> and reprobate the arbitrary arrests of the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Are <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> so much better than Southerners that it is right to imprison, slay, and persecute in all conceivable modes, the people of the <rs>South</rs>, drive their women and children from their homes, destroy and rob and steal their property, and desolate their land, while merely to deprive <num value="1">one</num> Northern man of liberty is an outrage so great as to threaten the liberties of the whole <rs>North</rs>, and to demand the universal execration!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Are these distinctions hypocritical, or do <persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Seymour,Horatio,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> and others think them just?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If pretended, and merely thrown out to make fair weather with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seymour,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Seymour,Horatio,,,"><surname>Seymour</surname></persName> or Co. are not only dishonest, but too cowardly to resist even were he to put the rope around their necks!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If they are sincere, and really think the attempt to establish a grinding despotism in the <rs>South</rs> is right, while they proclaim against any infringement of individual right at the <rs>North</rs>--then they are after all <hi rend="smallcaps"><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>!</hi> Nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Seymour,Horatio,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hunt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Hunt,Washington,,,"><surname>Hunt</surname></persName> are no better than <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> and <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><surname>Chase</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> &mdash; may, not so good &mdash; not even so good as <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They are consistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They are for the despotism &mdash; for submission to its authority everywhere and all the time, and particularly for the crushing of the rebellion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Thus viewing the inconsistency of these persons &mdash; their truly <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> position of selfishness &mdash; utter indifference to the wrongs and outrages of others so long as they are not troubled or their rights are not invaded &mdash; thus regarding them, we should be glad to hear that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had put them promptly under arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They richly merit it. A <hi rend="italics">coup d'elat</hi> of that sort would be a capital thing for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and a very just commending to their own lips of the poisoned chalice which they offer to the <rs>South</rs>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Still there were things notable in the speeches, and the running commentary upon them by the multitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><num value="1">One</num> gentleman emulated <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, and commended striking examples in historic retribution to the meditation of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The interpolations of the masses were pithy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It may be that the ideas inculcated by the scene and the sayings may come to something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Time will tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But all in the <rs>South</rs> must desire to see put to the test that bold assertion of <persName n="Hunt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Hunt,Washington,,,"><surname>Hunt</surname></persName>, on the &#x0022;house tops,&#x0022; that no <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName> &#x0022;shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without process of law.&#x0022; It is a sort of dare to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, uttered rather tauntingly, and calculated to provoke him.
