<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Since the memorable battle at <placeName reg="Reams, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2113864">Reams</placeName> a station, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last, there has been no fighting on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The enemy, however, commenced shelling the city heavily yesterday morning, and several houses were struck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is in this barbarous practice that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Petersburg,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> finds solace for his grief over his late defeat; but the army that confronts him stands as firm as a rock, and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is as defiant as ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> In the enemy's several attempts to cut and hold the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName> he has lost not less than <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men. <measure n="9000" type="prisoners">Nine thousand prisoners</measure> have been taken, and his killed and wounded, at a low estimate, will reach <num value="6000">six thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Thus it will be seen, that while the holding of this line of communication is somewhat annoying to us, it is exceedingly expensive amusement to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Again, in the early engagements before <persName n="Grant,,Petersburg,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="default:Grant,Petersburg,,,"><foreName>Petersburg</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> lost <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men, according to the admission of war journals at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>At the explosion of the mine, we have the same authority for stating that he sustained a <unclear>ther</unclear> loss of <num value="5000">five thousand</num>, which, added to the above, makes his aggregate loss during the short siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Nor does this include the loss in <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Butler,George,W.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s department, or in the engagements on the north side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> If the abolition journals of the <rs>North</rs>, instead of publishing lying bulletins of the favorable progress of the siege, were to lay before their readers such undeniable facts as the foregoing, the people might well stand appalled, and they would soon be as clamorous for peace as they have ever been for pushing on the war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The enemy's works at <placeName reg="Reams, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2113864">Reams</placeName>' captured by our troops on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, were very strong, and constructed with much ingenuity and skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They were built of logs, fence rails and earth, extended on both sides of the railroad, and were protected on all sides, and as they thought, both in front and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>They are now in our possession, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have made no attempt to recapture them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>No officers of higher rank are among the number, though it was currently reported that a brigadier-general had fallen into our hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Another lot of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners, among them between <num value="60">sixty</num> and <measure n="70" type="wounded">seventy wounded</measure>, were brought to this city yesterday from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><num value="1">One</num> died on the passage. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The rumor that the enemy had landed in force at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,7017624" n="1.000 27" reg="pamunkey, virginia, united states">Pamunkey river</placeName>, is without foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>There might have been a small party in the vicinity on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, though this is doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>An official dispatch, received on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, states that there was no enemy there at that time. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Although a report of a victory over the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> is not confirmed, it is evident from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts that something had taken place which the military authorities desired to suppress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>A dispatch, concerning operations on <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s line, sent from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, was smothered by the press censor in the last-named city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The most important intelligence we can now look for must come from <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It is not so important that he should do so much damage to the roads in <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s rear as it is that he should remain on them, giving them a tapping every day. <measure n="2weeks" type="date">Two weeks</measure> (if he can stay so long) will settle the question of the enemy's remaining on this side of the <rs>Chattahoochee</rs>, and then the question as to whether his army will ever get home again becomes open to discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Our scouts report that some portions of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s forces are already reduced to green corn for rations, and we know that the country from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> to <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, on the <rs>Georgia State</rs> road, has been devastated for <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> each side by the enemy gathering provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>As far as we can hear from <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> he is doing his work well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The road between the cities named has been pretty well used up, and now we hear of our forces destroying that between <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>So timid have the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their forts been, that much of their cattle has been driven off almost from under their guns. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The possession of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> may now be said to be reduced to a cavalry fight about the lines of communication, and <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> so recognizes it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>His position had already been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>He had already declared the only basis upon which he could treat for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Independence and integrity of boundaries were to be acknowledged as preliminaries to any negotiation even.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>How it came out, and in what form it was presented to the world, is perfectly immaterial.
