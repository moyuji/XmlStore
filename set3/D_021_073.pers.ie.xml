<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> I have been much pleased to see an expression of feeling (nearly simultaneous in different places) in favor of contributions by the ladies to raise money to build a gunboat, as their offering to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>From a notice in the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>,</hi> of saturday, I learn that the <unclear>in ive</unclear> was taken last week, so far as our town is concerned, and the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> of the same date, invites the &#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="Lady">Ladies</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022; to hold a meeting for the purpose of organizing an &#x0022;association to build gunboats for the defence of the city&#x0022; I wish to make a suggestion or <num value="2">two</num> as to the plan for putting this very desirable enterprise under way &mdash; and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, may I be pardoned for offering an objection to the <hi rend="italics">form </hi> of the notice in the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It specifies &#x0022;an association for building gunboats to defend the city.&#x0022; Now it seems to be quite out of place to propose building gunboats for any particular locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Our Government would probably not be willing to accept a boat designated for special service, and not as entirely at their disposal, to send to any point whatever, as any other boat in our little navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> See General Orders, <num value="16">No. 16</num>, published in another column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>It revokes, on the spot, all leaves of absence, from whatsoever quarter obtained; it orders all officers and men absent from duty, except on surgeon's certificate of disability, to return at once to their respective commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The Department adopts this regulation with reluctance; but we feel assured that it will be cheerfully obeyed.--The enemy is pressing us on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We want every man we can get. We cannot spare a man. Our soldiers, who have manifested so much devotion, so much self-denial, so much patriotism, will bear this new cross without a murmur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>We appeal to them in the name of all that they hold sacred &mdash; country, home, wives, children, friends, altars, and firesides &mdash; to hasten at once to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>They will thereby add to the already large debt of gratitude due them from their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>They will be admired and pointed at, as men who were, when the occasion called for it, ready to sacrifice all for their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Posterity will hold them in veneration, and they will be recorded in history as worthy of all imitation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> Men of the <rs>South</rs>, will you be found wanting on such an occasion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Your former history proves that you will not. Wherever your duty calls you, there you will be. It may be hard to relinquish the pleasures of home sooner than you had expected; but your country calls, and you will not fail her. Her eyes are upon you, and great as will be your reward if you succeed, greater still will be your misfortune if you fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>But why speak of failing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It is a word of which you know not the meaning, when it is applied to the discharge of your duty. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>We care not to boast of her past, although we might ever, without fear of contradiction, that there must be something beyond accident in the fame of a Commonwealth which, from her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlement to the present hour, has produced generation after generation of the greatest and purest minds of the continent; which, for centuries, from the hour when <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> planted the seed of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> civilization in her soil to the day when <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> gave to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> its liberty, and from that to this, when her noble men and generous women are offering up their life blood in defence of principle and right, has been as heroic and magnanimous a Commonwealth as ever flourished in ancient or modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Nor is it only by the operation of social laws and democracy run mad that New York has become what she is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Such is the general characteristic of their <hi rend="italics">respectable</hi> classes, with some exception, for there are exceptions to the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of New York, just so there were exceptions in <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Such is New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>This is what a city, once honorable, dignified, and intelligent, has become by the overthrow of conservative institutions and the influx of the scum, of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>And such, predicts <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Where the transportation is so great as it has been during the war, it is impossible to effect it without the best system, and any interference, however good the intentions, may, and probably will, prevent such system from being carried out.

This order leaves the military men to do the fighting, and the <name>Superintendents</name> alone to do the running, in which capacity we are sure they will each do their part well.
