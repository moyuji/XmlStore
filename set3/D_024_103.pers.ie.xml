<head>Iron and wooden frigates.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> A very interesting debate has taken place in the <rs>British</rs> <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> on the comparative <unclear></unclear> for men-of-war of wooden ships, iron plated and <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The Admiralty had proposed, among the other designs of the current year, to build <unclear><hi rend="italics">de n</hi></unclear> <num value="5">five</num> wooden ships, in order that these when built might be converted, by the application of metal plates, into iron-cased frigates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs>, however, thought that while to convert existing ships was all very well, to build new ones for conversion was rather too strong a measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Farther information was demanded, and this was given in the form of a &#x0022;statement&#x0022; from the <name>Controller</name> of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> This officer, according to a report in the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, does not absolutely admit the superiority of iron for ships of war, though he confesses that it has great advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>He allows that an <rs n="iron ship" type="product">iron ship</rs> can be built of larger dimensions than a wooden ship without any loss of strength, and that besides being stronger the structure would undoubtedly be more durable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Against these recommendations, however, he sets off several drawbacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/><rs n="iron ships" type="product">Iron ships</rs> are weak in the bottom, and their bottoms are sadly liable to foul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Real good iron, again, is represented as hard to come by, and thin or defective plates can be easily pierced by shot, with terrible consequences to the ship's crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Lastly, even the durability of the iron vessel is quoted as a disadvantages for, as models are by no means settled, there is no good in building everlasting ships on what may prove mistaken patterns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> A great diversity of opinion was manifested in the <rs type="place">House</rs> upon the points set forth in the statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The case of the <rs>Alabama</rs> and the <rs>Hatteras</rs> was incidentally referred to, and it was said that the defeat of the latter had been attributed (a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> protest) to the foulness of her bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The advocates of <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs> contended that iron merchant vessels pursue their voyages over the world without any such disadvantage, whilst their opponents maintained that ships of war were more exposed to fouling from remaining long stationary in harbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Reference was made in the course of the debate to the untimely end of the <rs>Monitor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmarston</foreName></persName> stated that out of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> ships of war now building in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, <num value="11">eleven</num> are of iron entirely, though he regarded it as a well ascertained fast that in power of resistance a ship with iron plating and a thick wooden side behind the iron, is equal to any ship afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs> finally decided in favor of the <rs>Admiralty</rs> proposition, (viz: to build <num value="5">five</num> wooden ships, to be iron-cased,) by the large majority of <num value="83">eighty-three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The Government expressed a strong desire not to have its hands tied to any particular mode of ship-building, because new inventions are continually coming up, and as <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> said, &#x0022;the experience of every month may lead to a considerable modification of preconceived notions, and errors hastily committed cannot be hastily repaired.&#x0022; </p> </div3>
