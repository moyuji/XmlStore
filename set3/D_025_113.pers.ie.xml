<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> After <num value="3">three</num> consecutive days of uninterrupted sunshine &mdash; the longest term of dry weather we have had for a month past &mdash; we are again visited by a heavy rain, which is pouring down as I write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>So much wet weather would at any time add greatly to the discomfort of troops who are insufficiently provided with tents, blankets, and shoes; but in a camp like this, located in a wide, muddy valley, where the streams are easily swollen, and where the water passes off slowly, it is almost intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>You may form some idea of the nature of the soil and of the quantity of water that has fallen, when you are informed that upon waking up some mornings since, I found that half a dozen new springs (or wet weather springs, as farmers call them,) had formed in my tent during the night, the water from which was running out in as many miniature streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If such was my condition under a good tent, what must be the condition of the men who stand all night on the muddy flats and in the trenches half filled with water, who have but <num value="1">one</num> blanket and a slight fly for their shelter, and sometimes not even that much? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Once more, therefore, would I entreat every man and woman in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who has a blanket to spare to send it immediately to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>And when they make up their gifts let them not forget the <name>Tennessean</name>, <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs>, Texans, Arkansans, Missourian and Louisianian, who for the present have no homes, and who yet have their heads to the blast of battle and the storms of Heaven in our defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>No troops deserve a larger share of our sympathy and affection than the brave soldiers from those States, and none stand so much in need of our care and attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> For some weeks past the weather has been very unfavorable to military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Since the date of my last letter nothing has occurred that it would not be impolitic to mention, beyond the daily exchange of shots between the opposing batteries.--No further effort has been made to regain possession of <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>, where the enemy has been industriously exerting himself to render his position secure, and reopen the railroad from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, for the transportation of supplies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The following estimate of the strength of the <rs>Federal</rs> army is based upon reports obtained from <num value="3">three</num> different and well informed sources just before the battle, and I am satisfied, as you would be if you were in possession of all the facts, that it approximates the truth very nearly: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Nobody slept, as you may suppose; for the idea of falling into the sea, had nothing pleasant about it, and it was necessary to keep a look out in order to effect, if necessary, a descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>An immense plain was beneath us. The villages appeared to us like children's toys; rivers seemed like little rivulets; it was magical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The sun shone splendidly over all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Unhappily the heavens had made us forget the earth, over which blew a wind so violent that in a few minutes our anchors &mdash; enormous fulcrums of iron &mdash; were broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We rose from <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> metres, and fell with incredible force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Little by little the balloon ceased to rise, and the car fell upon its side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Then began a furious disordered race; all disappeared before us &mdash; trees, thickets, walls, all broken or burst through by the shock; it was frightful.--Sometimes it was a lake, in which we plunged; a bog, the thick mud of which entered our mouths and our eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It was maddening. &#x0022;Stop stop!&#x0022; we shouted, enraged with the monster who was dragging us along. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>There were we squatting down upon the fall osier car. &#x0022;Take care?&#x0022; we cried, when a tree was in the way. We turned from it, and the tree was broken, but the balloon was discharging its gas, and if the immense plain we were crossing had yet a few leagues, we were saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>But suddenly a forest appeared in the horizon; we must leap out at whatever risk, for the car would be dashed to pieces at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> collision with those trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I got down into the car, and raising myself I know not how, for I suffered from a wound in my knees, my trousers were torn. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>In trying to assist the latter I was nearly drowned, for I fell into the water and sank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>They picked me up again, and I found the bath had done me good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>By the assistance of the inhabitants the salvage was got together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Vehicles were brought.--They placed us upon straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>My knees bled; my loins and head seemed to be like mincemeat; but I did not lose my presence of mind an instant, and for a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> I felt myself humiliated at looking from the truss of straw at those clouds which in the night I had had under my feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>It does not signify; we have made a good journey, and I marvel to see with what indifference we may regard the most frightful death; for, besides the prospect of being dashed about on our way, we had that of gaining the sea; and how long should we have lived then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>I am glad to have seen this &mdash; happier yet at having to narrate it to you. These <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> who surround us are brave people, and we have been as well cared for as the resources of the little spot will allow. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> Whilst this modification revokes the authority of the provost marshals and military officers to arrest the classes of persons enumerated in the preamble to the order &#x0022;found at or hanging about, or approaching any poll or place of election,&#x0022; it directs them to prevent all violence or disturbance about the polls, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> To meet such disturbances the judges of election, as I have already stated, are clothed with ample powers, and I had received no previous intimation that there was any reason to apprehend a disturbance of any kind at the polls on the day of election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>In the absence of any military display, there would certainly seem to be as little cause for such apprehensions as ever before existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>A preparation by the <rs>Government</rs> by military means to provide for such contingency will be quite as likely to provoke as to subdue such a disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Not only so, but the military thus required to prevent violence or disturbance about the polls must necessarily be empowered to arrest the parties they may charge with such disorder, and they are still left in effect &#x0022;the exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested&#x0022; --a power they may as readily abuse as any other. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>He is the father of the builders, and is connected with them in business: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> He then referred to the speech delivered within the last few days by <persName n="Cobden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Cobden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cobden</surname></persName>, in which that gentleman had been pleased to make use of some complimentary terms about the late firm at <placeName key="tgn,7012043" n="1.000 2" reg="birkenhead,wirral,england,united kingdom,europe">Birkenhead</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>He did not agree with all the remarks of <persName n="Cobden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Cobden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cobden</surname></persName>, that Government vessels should be constructed by private builders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>On the contrary, he thought it was desirable that the <rs>Government</rs> should have a portion of the work done at private establishments, so that in case of war they would not only have the dockyards to fall back upon, but the resources of the private yards.--[Hear, hear.] He urged that both in engineering and shipbuilding, as well as in other matters, competition was beneficial, and brought-out the event and ability of the competitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>In support of this view he referred to <num value="2">two</num> ships which had been built in this neighborhood &mdash; the <rs>Alabama</rs> and the <rs>Florida</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>These <num value="2">two</num> vessels had been built a long time, and they had defied the efforts of <num value="400">four hundred</num> ships of-war to capture them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>These ships, he repeated, were designed by private individuals and built for private individuals; but in this country the system was for <num value="1">one</num> man to carry the brains of the whole talent for building ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He next referred to the want of sufficient dock space for Government purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> Referring again to the <rs>Alabama</rs>, he contradicted various statements which had been made about her departure from this port, said that she was lying in the dock ready for sea for some time, and was visited by numbers of curious people; that she went into the river in the night, but stopped there until <num value="11">eleven</num> or <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> the following day. <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> had expressed his doubts whether the <rs>Government</rs> would not have rendered itself liable to damages if they had seized the <rs>Alabama</rs>, but the recent speech by <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,1050450" n="1.000 10" reg="Blairgowrie,Perth and Kinross,Scotland,United Kingdom,Europe">Blairgowrie</placeName> did not seem to agree with that delivered by the <name>Premier</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> A revolution is a moral earthquake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It upsets everything, not only in the political, but in the military world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It leaves nothing standing that it found so. It turns the brain topsy-turvy, and plays havoc with all preconceived ideas. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> &#x0022;Concentrate to fight, disperse to subsist,&#x0022; said <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>And, further, &#x0022;when you are about to fight a battle, concentrate all your forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Bring every man. Do not leave <num value="1">one</num> behind.&#x0022; It really would appear to the uninitiated that this is good advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It would seem when a battle is to be fought that every man who is of any service, and who can be, ought to be brought to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It would seem to be the interest of every General to make victory as little doubtful as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Again, when there is no immediate prospect of a fight, it would seem that it were best to disperse the troops, in order to render subsistence easier and more certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>A large body of men, it used to be thought, will consume more provisions than a small body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>But our revolution has effectually abolished these obsolete ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Concentration for the purpose of fighting seems to have been voted an obsolete idea; dispersion for the purpose of subsisting is treated as unworthy of consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> is an old fogy, and his military principles belong to another age of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The modern doctrine is to concentrate for subsistence, and disperse to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>By doing so, you take no unfair advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>You give your enemy every chance to attack you in superior force, and you reserve to yourself the glory of beating him with an inferior number of men, relinquishing all hope of pursuing him after beating him, and giving him every chance of rallying to try it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It is the true game of the ring, where no champion thinks of striking an enemy after he is down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It is in the very spirit of chivalry, for does not <persName n="Scott,Sir,Walter,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="default:Scott,Walter,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Walter</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who knew most about such things, make <persName><foreName>Richard</foreName> <genName n="1">I</genName></persName>. say, when a garrison was about to surrender from starvation, &#x0022;It were better to send such fellows their dinner, and then buffet it out with them for the castle, than to starve them, as the beggarly <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs> famish their hounds!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> Again. An army being once concentrated, it was formerly supposed to be a matter of great importance to prevent the enemy from doing the same thing by attacking their columns in detail, while on the march for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Where the concentrated army held an interior line, this was supposed to be comparatively easy, and it offered the great advantage of falling on each detached portion with a superior force, and thus insuring victory, at the same time it rendered it much less costly in blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Innumerable instances were quoted, in the olden time, of successful operations of this description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Thus the great <rs>Frederica</rs> was threatened by <num value="3">three</num> armies, invading his territories at the same time from <num value="3">three</num> different directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They were each somewhat superior in numbers to his own, and if united would easily have over whelmed him. But he held the central position, and falling upon <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> and then the other, succeeded in defeating them all. His operations on this occasion were regarded as masterpieces, and were held up to the world as examples to all <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in similar predicaments, of what energy and activity could do. The various operations of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> around <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, where he held a central position on the <name>Adige</name>, and by means of it succeeded in destroying <num value="2">two</num> armies, each <num value="3">three</num> times as numerous as his own, were also thought worthy of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Indeed, in former times it was thought a matter of such high moment to attack an enemy in detail that the most elaborate man&#x0153;uvres were executed to separate his columns when united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The art, however, has undergone a complete change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/><rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in a central position now wait with the utmost patience until the most distant columns of the enemy unite all around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>We recollect no instance of such columns being attacked on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>A bloody and indecisive battle, in which <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon <num value="1000">thousands</num> are slaughtered or maimed for life, is usually fought after the enemy has brought all his men together, and rendered it impossible to gather any fruit even from a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>A long period of inaction ensues, the parties recruit and recover their breath, another bloody battle is fought, in which, as usual, both sides claim the victory, and then comes another resting spell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> The pre-revolutionary idea was that battles were fought for some purpose and with some object in view beyond the mere pleasure of slaughtering and being slaughtered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Each battle of those who, before the present war, were regarded as master spirits was a political stroke, and victory was therefore followed up with unrelenting pertinacity.--Such views have become obsolete, or, at least, they are apparently not entertained by the leaders of the present day. The most overwhelming defeat of the enemy is suffered to pass unimproved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>He flies from the field in the utmost disorder, but his flight is like that of the wicked: &#x0022;He fleet when no man pursueth.&#x0022; He retires a short distance, rallies, takes heart, and quietly commences reorganizing his shattered battalions, recruiting his ranks with fresh troops, and replacing his captured artillery with new pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>In a little time he is out again, more powerful than ever, and it is necessary to fight another gigantic battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> We have nothing to say against the new system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>We are constantly told that common sense has nothing to do with military affairs, and that nobody but professional men can know anything about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>This may all be true &mdash; we do not pretend to dispute it. But we hope we may be allowed to say that it all looks very strange to an outside observer. </p> </div3>
