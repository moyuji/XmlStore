<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> If the future historian of this war should rely upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> statements of their numbers at the commencement of each campaign, he will narrate a defence more heroic than it was ever yet the lot of mortal writer to record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The struggle of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> with the whole power of the <rs>East</rs>, as far as the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7001674" n="1.000 10" reg="Ganges,Asia">Ganges</placeName>, wielded by <num value="1">one</num> man, and directed to a single object, was the mere skirmishing of kites and crows in comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The area of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, not occupied by the enemy, embraces not more we should think than <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of inhabitants, old and young, men, women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Yet within the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, according to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> estimates, more than <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of men have been precipitated upon it, without producing the slightest disposition to succumb, or in the remotest degree shaking the firm and confident faith of those who inhabit it in the ultimate and triumphant success of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Nor have these enormous hosts been superior in numbers only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>In all the resources of modern warfare, their superiority has been still more remarkable than in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>They have had an abundant supply of arms of the most approved pattern, while we are indebted to our victories over them for a large proportion of those which our soldiers wield for their destruction, as <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName>, after the slaughter of Thrasymene, armed his own troops with the weapons of his dead enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>They have a navy of <num value="600">six hundred</num> vessels, while we have not half a dozen ships afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>They have the command of nearly all our rivers below the head of tide water, and they have hermetically sealed all our ports but <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>They have inexhaustible supplies of men in <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and are recruiting our negroes on a grand scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The very earth trembles beneath the tread of the hosts which they annually send forth to oppress a mere knot of freemen determined not to be enslaved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> This year we are, as usual, entertained by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers with flaming descriptions of the mighty deeds that are to be done, and the mighty hosts that are to do them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They all open at once upon that inexhaustible theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>A Washington correspondent of the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName> tells us that <persName n="Barnes,Acting-Surgeon General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Acting-Surgeon General">Acting Surgeon General</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName>, in <date value="1863-10">October, 1863,</date> estimated that provision should be made for medical and hospital supplies for <num value="1000000">one million</num> <num value="239273">two hundred and thirty-nine thousand two hundred and seventy-three</num> soldiers, but that the bill just passed by the <rs type="place">House</rs> allows supplies for only <num value="753564">seven hundred and fifty-three thousand five hundred and sixty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>This, then, is the army we are to encounter this <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>; an army nearly as large as that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> kept on foot when he was obliged to be on his guard against all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> &mdash; an army larger than <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName> H. has ever had on foot, and fully as large as the largest ever maintained by his father &mdash; an army half as large again as either that of <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and twice as large as the largest Prussian army that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Yet it is not larger than that with which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> opened the last campaign, and not so large as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army has been at times during the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. Would not any other nation on earth, in consideration of the pitiful results of their vast preparations, hang their heads in shame? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> talent for amplification, however, does not confine its operations to boasting of its own numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>These beaten, they invariably discover that they have been outnumbered by <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Liare should have good memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>How is it possible for a people so inferior in numbers, upon the whole, to bring <num value="5">five</num> to their <num value="1">one</num> upon any <num value="1">one</num> field of battle? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> The pompous proclamations of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers at the beginning of a campaign never did frighten the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>They have long since ceased even to amuse them.
