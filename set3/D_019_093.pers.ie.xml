<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Since then all has been bustle and activity &mdash; the ladies sharing in the general interest, and lending their aid to the arrangements of knapsack and other necessaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> Last night, at the hour of <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, a large number of citizens congregated in front of the <rs type="place">Exchange Hotel</rs>, with the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName> Band, and serenaded <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Stephens,the Honorable,Alexander,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="default:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>,</hi> <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The distinguished gentleman was introduced to the throng by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Mayo,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Mayo,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Mayo</surname></persName>,</hi> and received with hearty cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>In response, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName></hi> returned his acknowledgments for the warmth of the personal greeting, and his most profound thanks for it as the representative of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>He spoke of the rejoicing the secession of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had caused among her Southern sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Her people would feel justified if they could hear it as he had. He would not speak of the <name>States</name> who were out, but those who were in. <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> was out, and did not know exactly how she got out. The fires that were blazing here he had seen all along his track from <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>At <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington, N.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> The news from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> was equally cheering &mdash; there the mountains were on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Some of the <name>States</name> still hesitated, but soon all would be in. <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> was no longer in the late Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>She was out by resolutions of her popular assemblies, in <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and other cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> would soon be out. Her people were moving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/><placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>--who could doubt the stand she would take, when her Governor, in reply to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> insolent proclamation, had said, <q>&#x0022;You shall have no troops for the furtherance of your illegal, unchristian and diabolical schemes?&#x0022;</q> <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> will soon add another star to the <rs>Southern</rs> galaxy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Where <placeName key="tgn,7007516" n="1.000 12" reg="maryland">Maryland</placeName> is, you all know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Southern blood had been shed on her soil, and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would never stand idly by and see her citizens shot down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The cause of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> was the cause of the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>He said the cause we were engaged in was that which attached people to the old Constitution of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--it was the cause of civil, religious, and constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Many of us looked at that Constitution as the anchor of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6199" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName>, the people had been attached to the previous Union, but the <rs>Constitution</rs> which governed it was framed by Southern talent and understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Assaults had been made on it ever since it was established &mdash; lately, a platitudinous construction had been made by the <rs>North</rs>, while we of the <rs>South</rs> sought to interpret it as it was &mdash; advocating strict construction, State rights, the right of the people to rule, etc. He spoke of all the <num value="15">fifteen</num> Southern States as advocating this construction.--To violate the principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was to initiate revolution &mdash; and the <rs>Northern States</rs> had done this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> The Constitution framed at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> discarded the obsolete ideas of the old Constitution, but had preserved its better portion, with some modifications, suggested by the experience of the past, and it had been adopted by the <rs>Confederated States</rs>, who would stand to it. The old Constitution had been made an engine of power to crush out liberty; that of the <rs>Confederated States</rs>, to preserve it. The old Constitution was improved in our hands, and those living under it had, like the <name>Ph</name>&#x0152;nix, risen from the ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The revolution lately begun did not affect alone property, but liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>He alluded to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> call for <num value="75000">75,000</num> volunteers, and said he could find no authority in the old Constitution for such a flagrant abuse of power.--His <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proclamation had stigmatized as pirates all who sailed in letters of marque; this was also in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which alone gave Congress that power.--What had the friends of liberty to hope for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Beginning in usurpation, where would he end?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>You were, however, said he, no longer under the rule of this tyrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>With strong arms and stout hearts you have now resolved to stand in defence of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had but asserted their rights.--They believed that their rulers derived their just powers from the consent of the governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had a right to deny the existence of the sovereign right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Our people did not want to meddle with the <rs>Northern States</rs>-- only wanted the latter to let them alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>When did <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ever ask the assistance of the <rs>General Government</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> If there is sin in our institutions, we bear the blame &mdash; and will stand acquitted by natural law, and the higher law of the <name>Creator</name>.--We stand upon the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Nature. --The Southern States did not wish a resort to arms after secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>History, he said, if rightly written, would acquit us of a desire to shed our brothers' blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> The law of necessity and of right compelled us to act as we did. He had reason to believe that the <name>Creator</name> smiled on it. The Federal flag was taken down without the loss of a single life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>He believed that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> would be with us and bless us to the end. We had appealed to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles for the justness of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Madness and folly ruled at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Had it not have been so, several of the <name>States</name> would have been in the old Union for a year to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The Gods <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> made mad those they would destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Every son of the <rs>South</rs>, from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, should rally to the support of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.--If <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> quits <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as ignominiously as he entered it, <hi rend="smallcaps"><name n="God" type="God">God's</name></hi> will have been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The argument was now exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Be prepared; stand to your arms; defend your wives and firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>He alluded to the momentous consequences of the issue involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Rather than be conquered, let every <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> man rally to drive back the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The conflict may be terrible, but the victory will be ours.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/> Your letter of yesterday has been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Before this, you will have learned through the <name>Press</name> all that has occurred at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and at this place; but I cannot begin to give you a just conception of the excitement created, not only here, but throughout the whole Southern country, by the proclamation of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>, which, in many respects, may be regarded as the most unfortunate document that ever issued from the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>In the absence of that paper, this State could not have been carried out of the <rs>Union</rs>; with it, the <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName>, and the <rs>Union</rs> feeling, has been almost entirely swept out of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>You cannot meet with <num value="1">one</num> man in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> who is not inflamed with a <hi rend="italics">passion for war,</hi> and every <num value="1">one</num> seems to regard the proclamation as a declaration of war for the subjugation of the entire <rs>South</rs>, and for the extermination of slavery; reason (with them on this point) would as soon arrest the motion of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, as it would check the current of their passions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/> When I saw you in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, some <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> since, I had the honor to lay before you and other members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, as well as before <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself, a plan for the settlement of our troubles, through the medium of a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>, to give to the seceded States <hi rend="italics">leave to withdraw.</hi> I thought then, as I do now, that the plan then suggested was the only solution to the dreadful crisis which was upon us. Since that time, matters have assumed a far more frightful aspect, and I now venture to make <num value="1">one</num> more effort to save the unnecessary effusion of brothers' blood; and, in the name of liberty, humanity, and Christianity, I implore you to give it your earnest and solemn deliberation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/> I need hardly say that no man in this nation has held in higher appreciation the value of our blessed Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>No man has labored more constantly and earnestly for its perpetuation than I!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>No man's heart can bleed more freely for its loss than mine; no man can mourn more sorrowfully for its overthrow than I will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>No man can condemn more severely the immediate causes that have so unnecessarily led us into this awful and terrible catastrophe than I do. Yet for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, after an entire night of sleepless reflection, when I prayed as I never prayed before for wisdom and strength to do my duty, my mind has been brought to the conclusion that a dissolution is an inevitable decree of fate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/> I am satisfied that a contest on the part of the <rs>General Government</rs>, with its perfect military organization, powerful Naval forces, its command of money, and its credit without limit, backed by <num value="18">eighteen</num> or <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of people, against <num value="8000000">eight millions</num>, without military organization, without Naval forces, and without money or credit, is not likely to be of doubtful result in the end &mdash; but after that, what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Can the <rs>Union</rs> be preserved on such terms, or would it be worth preserving, if it could?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>After the best blood of the country has been shed in a war, which has passion, prejudice, and unnatural but mutual hate for its foundation, intensified by the conflict, could the <num value="2">two</num> sections ever be brought together as <num value="1">one</num> people again?--and would it not require large standing armies, in constant active service, to conquer and maintain peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>And would not that end at last in a hateful, loathsome military despotism? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/> If I am right in all this, would not a peaceful separation, not as a military necessity, but as a triumph of reason, order, law, liberty, morality and religion, over passion, pride, prejudice, hatred, disorder, and the force of the mob, be a far wiser and more desirable solution of the problem than such scenes as will result from a purely sectional warfare, (result as it may,) and from which the heart sickens, and the soul recoils with horror? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/> You may cut, maim, kill and destroy; you may sweep down battalions with your artillery; you may block up commerce with your fleets; you may starve out the <num value="1000">thousands</num> and tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of the enemies of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>You may <hi rend="italics">overrun</hi> but you cannot <hi rend="italics">subjugate</hi> the <name>United South</name>; and if you could do all this, you could not do it without inflicting an equal amount of misery upon those who are its best friends, and who have stood as long as there was a plank to stand upon, by the side of the <rs>Union</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>Our streets may run red with blood; our dwellings may be levelled with the earth; our fields may be laid waste; our hearthstones may be made desolate; and then, at the last, what end has been gained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>Why, the <rs>Government</rs> has exhibited its power!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>which has never been questioned but by the idle, the ignorant and the deluded, and for the display of which there will be abundant opportunities, without an effort now, on either side, to cut each other's throats! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/> So far from its being regarded as a betrayal of weakness by the other powers of the <rs>Globe</rs> will it not be looked upon in the present emergency as an act of magnanimity and heroism on the part of the more powerful party to propose terms of peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>Let me, then, as a strong, devoted, unalterable friend of the <rs>Union</rs>, (<hi rend="italics">if it could be maintained,</hi>) --let me, as a conscientious and unchangeable opponent of the fatal heresy of secession, urge upon this Administration the policy of issuing another proclamation, <hi rend="italics">proposing a truce to hostilities,</hi> and the immediate assembling of a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName> to reorganize the <rs>Independence</rs> of such of the <name>States</name> to desire to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, and make the experiment of separate Government, which it will not, as I think, take them long to discover is the most egregious error that man, in his hour of madness ever committed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/> In <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> from this time the remaining <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would be stronger and more powerful than the <num value="34">thirty-four</num> States were <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago &mdash; and you will have a Government permanent and enduring for all time to come, to which all who seek an asylum from oppression may resort hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/> I will not undertake to speculate on the experiment of a Southern Republic;--my opinions on that subject are well defined, and too well understood to make it necessary that they should be canvassed here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>Let it be tried, and let it work out its own salvation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> If this policy can be adopted, all I shall ask for myself, will be the privilege of retiring to some secluded spot, where I can live in peace, and mourn over the downfall of the best Government--<hi rend="italics">wisely administered</hi>--with which man was ever blessed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/> I could not willingly take up arms against a Union that I have been taught and accustomed to adore, as indispensable to my own liberties, <hi rend="italics">and I never will raise</hi> my hand against my native State, although her arm has ever been against me and mine. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/> Passengers from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> last evening assure us that the amount of guns, stores and ammunition secured by the <rs>Virginia</rs> forces, after the burning of the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs>, was enormous, and our correspondence confirms the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>The guns in many instances were imperfectly spiked in the hurry and alarm of the <rs>Federal</rs> incendiaries, and are in no respect damaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>We copy from the <rs>Norfolk Herald</rs> of yesterday the following narrative of the exciting events of the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> preceding: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> the greatest excitement prevailed in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Troops were hurrying to and fro, and every <num value="1">one</num> anxious to know what was to be done, but unable to obtain the desired information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>The rumor was that the <rs>Cumberland</rs> was about to sail from the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs>, and preparations were made to prevent her. </p> </q><bibl n="Norfolk Herald"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/> At <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> an officer came from the yard, bearing a flag of truce, and was conducted to <placeName><persName n="Taliaferro,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> at the <rs type="place">Atlantic Hotel</rs>, where a consultation was held, which resulted in a promise from the commandant of the yard, <persName n="Macanley,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="mostcommon:Macanley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Com.</roleName> <surname>Macanley</surname></persName>, that none of the vessels should be removed nor a shot fired except in self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>This quieted the excitement, but it was renewed at a later hour, when it was ascertained that the <rs>Germantown</rs> and <rs>Merrimac</rs> had been scuttled, and that the heavy shears on the wharf at which the <rs>Germantown</rs> was lying had been cut away, and allowed to fall mid-ships across her decks, carrying away the main topmasts and yards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>It was also perceived that the men were busily engaged in destroying and throwing overboard side and small arms, &#x0026;c., and other property, and boats were constantly passing between the <rs>Pennsylvania</rs>, <placeName reg="Cumberland, Allegany, Maryland" key="tgn,2046811">Cumberland</placeName> and other vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>The assurance of the <rs>Commodore</rs>, given by his officer at the truce interview, however, tended to allay the apprehension of an immediate collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>But the continued stirring movements at the yard soon rendered it certain that it was the intention of <persName n="Macauley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00384" reg="mostcommon:Macauley,nomatch:0"><surname>Macauley</surname></persName> to destroy all the buildings and other property there --and it was therefore with not much surprise that, about midnight, after <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> slight explosions, the light of a serious conflagration was observed at the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>This continued to increase, and before daylight the demon-work of destruction was extended to the immense ship-houses known as A and B, (the former containing the entire frame of the New York, <num value="74">74</num>, which had been on the stocks unfinished, for some <measure n="38years" type="date">thirty-eight years</measure>,) and also to the long ranges of <num value="2">two</num>-story offices and stores on each side of the main gate of the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>The flames and heat from this tremendous mass of burning material was set by a Southwest wind directly towards the line of the vessels moored on the edge of the channel opposite the yard, and nearly all of these, too, were speedily enveloped in flames. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/> The scene at this time was grand and terrific beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>The roar of the conflagration was loud enough to be heard at <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> distance, and to this were added occasional discharges from the heavy guns of the old <rs>Pennsylvania</rs>, ship-of the line, as they became successively heated.--These guns it is asserted, were double-shotted and directed at different parts of the yard for the purpose of ensuring its complete demolishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>This, however, is certain &mdash; that it all her guns had been thus prepared and directed, the burnt district could not have been more completely cleared of its appurtenances. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/> As soon as the torch had been successfully applied to the ship-houses, the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs>, which had been kept under steam from the moment of her arrival, about nightfall on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, was put in motion, and taking the <rs>Cumberland</rs> in tow, retreated down the harbor, out of the reach of danger --freighted with a great portion of valuable munitions, &#x0026;c. from the yard, and the <rs>Commodore</rs> and other officers, who had won for themselves the inglorious distinction of destroying <hi rend="italics">devils</hi> in accomplishing such a vandal work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>The ships proceeded as far down as the barricades at the narrows, where the <rs>Cumberland</rs> was left at anchor, and the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> continued on to <placeName reg="Fort Monr">Fort Monr</placeName>&#x0152;. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>The property destroyed.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/> As far as we could judge from a cursory observation, the property destroyed embraced, besides the ship-houses and contents, the range of buildings on the north line of the yard, (except the <rs>Commodore</rs>'s and <rs type="role2">Commander</rs>'s residences, which are unhurt,) the old marine barracks, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> workshop, the immense lifting shears, the <term type="ship">ships</term> <rs type="ship">Pennsylvania</rs>, <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs>, <rs type="ship">Raritan</rs>, <rs type="ship">Columbia</rs>, and <term type="ship">brig</term> <rs type="ship">Delphine</rs>--burnt to the water's edge; the <term type="ship">sloop</term> <rs type="ship">Germantown</rs>, broken and sunk;the <rs>Plymouth</rs> scuttled and sunk even with her deck; and a vast amount of small arms, chronometers, and valuable engines and machinery in the <name>Ordnance</name> and other shops, broken up and rendered utterly useless. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>The Dry Dock.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/> Appearances indicated that it was intended to cripple this admirable and useful work, by blowing up the gates, but from some cause this work was not done, and the dock was found to be altogether unhurt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/> We cannot bring ourselves to believe that any officer of a Navy, distinguished hitherto by a high sense of honor and chivalrous courage, could willingly condescend to such an inglorious mode of warfare as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>We rather regard it as an emanation from the wretched cabal at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and a practical carrying out of the tactics laid down by the villainous <rs>Sumner</rs>, and other orators of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/> The past <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> with us contain events of wondrous interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Saturday our troops were under arms all the day &mdash; our community was all excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Rumors from the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs> came thick and fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>About <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, or before, it was ascertained that the fine <term type="ship">war steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs> was scuttled, the <rs>Germantown</rs> was crushed by the ponderous shears, and the small arms on board the ships were being broken in pieces and thrown overboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>It was evident there was a panic among the remaining officers of the yard and of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>They were regarded as tokens of a felt necessity to surrender upon demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Thus events were strangely thickening, when about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, a loud shout from a steamer as she passed our wharves, up to the yard, broke on our ears, surprising and saddening all hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>It proved to be the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Pawnee</rs>, which had brought from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> a large reinforcement of troops for <placeName reg="Old Point, Hancock, Maine" key="tgn,2557595">Old Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>She was said to have on board now <num value="500">500</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>As she fastened to the wharf out poured her troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>In a few moments, the sound of scores of sledge hammers broke on our ears, as they spiked the cannon, battered them and attempted to render them useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>It was evident a thorough destruction was intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Soon powder trains were laid all over the yard, and by <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time> the <rs type="place">Barracks</rs> was on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Between <time value="4">4</time> and <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time>, with the <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Cumberland</rs> in tow, the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> steamed off, and at a given signal the match was applied, and the whole yard seemed to be in a blaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The scene was terrific beyond conception-- description is impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/> The fire raged <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>; but it has turned out that only a small portion of the yard has been consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>The principal buildings, including the splendid officers' quarters and the <rs>Dry Dock</rs>, are unscathed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The <term type="ship">ships</term> <rs type="ship">Pennsylvania</rs>, <rs type="ship">Germantown</rs>, <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs>, and <num value="2">two</num> others, I believe, have been burnt to the water's edge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/> But a very large amount of property has been unhurt, and fall into our hands most opportunely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The cannon are very little damaged, and before the sun went down yesterday a number of them were prepared to occupy the battery being raised on the <rs type="place">Hospital</rs> shore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/> Yesterday was a day of terrible excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Hundreds of men were working most vigorously and effectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> This attempt to destroy the <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName> here, and with them a large portion of our city, is a vandalism and cowardice which bespeaks the meanness of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00385" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his coadjutors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>It will carry with it a moral effect worth more than <num value="1000000">millions</num> to us. A feeling has been wrought among this people which makes them more than legions to war against the vile fos. It has enkindled universal hate and contempt in this community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The world's sympathy, too, must be drawn out by this act towards a people thus visited by the malignant, yet impotent, effort to destroy them, by the doomed wretch who is called the <rs>President</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>They are lodged in jail, as is reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>All day Sunday there were rumors of a threatened bombardment of the <num value="2">two</num> towns, if they were not given up. For a period, the excitement here was intense, but towards evening it died away. </p>
