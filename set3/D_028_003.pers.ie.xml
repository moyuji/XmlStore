<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The bill to prevent quartermasters and commissaries from robbing the <rs>Government</rs>, which was presented a few days ago by <persName n="Orr,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Orr,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Orr</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, from the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName>, contains some provisions of singular severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Proceeding on the around that every man is to be regarded as a rascal until he can prove that he is an honest man, it compels the officer to give in, under oath, once in every <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, a schedule of all the property he possesses, and to account for any accumulation that may occur in the interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We cannot conceive that such a law would have but <num value="1">one</num> effect: It would compel every honest quartermaster and commissary to resign, for no man of spirit and honesty would accept an office in entering upon which he would Stand in the light of a criminal, and continue so to stand until he had proved himself to be innocent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The inquisition into the private affairs of individuals, which the law prescribes, is entirely opposed to the genius of our laws and the character of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Pass this law, and the chance is that peculation will increase many <num value="100">hundred</num> fold, for the simple reason that it will drive all honest quartermasters and commissaries out of the service, and substitute for them rogues, who regard no oath and will be restrained by no law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The reason assigned for proposing a law of such excessive severity is, that there have been enormous peculations in the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>If such be the case, we submit that it would be more consistent with justice to point out the individual culprits, and punish them to the extent of the law, than to stigmatize a whole class, many of them not even suspected, and the majority having characters which have never been impeached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>If this law pass, to say that a man is a quartermaster or commissary will be equivalent, in the public mind, to saying that he is a reseal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We protest against the injustice of stigmatizing a whole class for the sins of some half dozen members. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> In the discussions upon the subject, unbounded license of language seems to have been indulged in. Quartermasters and commissaries are said to have made &#x0022;baronial fortunes.&#x0022; But the charges have been so general, and so vague, that it seems impossible to fasten them upon any <num value="1">one</num> individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The whole class, the honest as well as the dishonest, come in for a share of the imputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Clearly, this is very improper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If there are individuals in the service who have made these enormous fortunes, and if it be clear that they have made them out of the public money, let them be pointed out. Let them be tried by the laws already existing for peculation and robbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Doubtless the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster General</rs> would lend all the assistance in his power to detect and punish such culprits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We understand he is anxious that all such should be pointed out, that he may aid in bringing them to justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Is not this preferable to making general and intangible charges against whole bodies of men, confounding the innocent with the guilty, and casting suspicion upon the honest man without bringing the criminal to judgment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We think so, decidedly; and we insist upon it that the guilty be prosecuted where they are <hi rend="italics">known</hi> to be guilty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> An honest man will be restrained from peculating by his own sense of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>A reseal will be restrained by no oath whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In the selection of officers, if more attention were paid to the character of applicants, we should have fewer malversation in office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>That is the main </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> point, after all. The character of the man is a better guarantee than any oath of office that was ever devised. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, it is stated by an Augusta paper, said, in connection with a gentleman of <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6199" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName>, that &#x0022;Slavery will exist in the <rs>South</rs> after the conclusion of peace, let the war terminate as it may, and that he expects to own a <num value="1000">thousand</num> slaves himself <num value="1">one</num> of these days.&#x0022; We have little doubt that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> made the remark, and as little that it will be realized in the event of our subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>What the form of slavery, or what name will be given to it by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ingenuity, we cannot foresee, but that the thing itself will continue, and that the negroes will have to work harder and fare worse than slaves have ever worked or fared before in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, is as certain as the rising of to-morrow's sun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sentiment of abolition is simply envy of the slaveholder, not love of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Why should he love the black laborer of a distant region more than the white laborer of his own? --Every <num value="1">one</num> is familiar with the harsh and oppressive manner in which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> employees in every department of business are treated by their employers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The thing is notorious and undeniable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is ridiculous, then, to suppose that men so selfish, callous and tyrannical to their white dependents should have a general and generous sympathy with <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>With the exception of some fanatics, whose imaginations have run away with their reason, there is not an honest Abolitionist in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The only question which presents itself to the great mass of that money &mdash; seeking and practical race is, &#x0022;Will slavery pay?&#x0022; The fate of slavery and the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, if conquered, depends solely upon the answer to that question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has evidently made up his own mind in the affirmative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He knows, and his countrymen know as well, that cotton, rice and sugar cannot be cultivated without slave labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There is some question about tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It may be that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will conclude that slave labor will <hi rend="italics">not</hi> pay in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and other border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In that event, they will give a sop to the philanthropy of the age by sacrificing the non-paying labor of those States to the demands of abolition, calling upon the world to admire and applaud their humanity, whilst they simply change the name and proprietorship of slavery in the cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> expects to own a <num value="1000">thousand</num> slaves, and other Federal generals will be equally fortunate.--The possession of the slaves will be simply transferred from the hands of their present owners to those of soldiers and citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They will raise more cotton, more sugar, and more rice, than were ever raised before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The only change in the system will be <num value="1">one</num> which will enable the new slave-owners to be relieved from the support of the laborers in sickness and old age. The horror which the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> troops experience in this war is nothing to that which they will suffer in fighting the battles of civilization?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They will die like sheep under their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> taskmasters; but their places can be readily supplied by importing Coolies, after the fashion of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, or reopening the slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>No remonstrances of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and no <placeName reg="Africa coast">Africa coast</placeName> squadrons would prevent the adoption of the latter alternative if found essential to the demand of slave labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It was the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought slaves from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> to this continent, and either of them would do it again, or any other thing which their interests demand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Next to the present proprietors, the condition of the present slaves will, in the event of Southern subjugation, be most pitiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The contrast to their former condition will intensify the agonies of their exhausting toil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They will be in the hands of men who do not understand them, who have no real sympathy with them, nor any concern of any kind, except to squeeze the greatest amount of profit possible out of their bones and sinews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They will curse the day that they ever heard of abolition; but it will be too late. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Such a rain of shot and shell never before fell upon any spot of earth since gunpowder was invented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>But the <rs>Confederates</rs> stood to their work in most gallant style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Many of them had never been under fire before; and yet they received the devouring blast from the fleet like men who knew not what fear was. We have no report of the casualties to-day, communication with the fort by telegraph having been interrupted; but there is reason to fear that they have been heavier than they were yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Unofficial telegrams received during the afternoon, however, before the wires were broken, stated that all was well, and that the garrison had replied to the enemy's fire less frequently than on yesterday. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> But the most serious part of the fight, to-day remains to be told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A portion of the fleet, moving up the beach <placeName><distance reg="2.5miles">two and a half miles</distance> above <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName></placeName>, swept the shore with grape and canister for an hour, at the end of which the boats were lowered, and a force, estimated to be <num value="3">three</num> brigades, was landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It is not improbable that other troops will be landed to-night, and possibly some artillery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> The enemy is now between <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and has cut off communication by land with the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>We also had strong batteries at <placeName reg="Rose Dew">Rose Dew</placeName>, between the <num value="2">two</num> Ogeechees, at <placeName reg="Beaulieu, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2022132">Beaulieu</placeName>, Thunderbolt, <placeName reg="Causlin's Bluff">Causlin's Bluff</placeName>, etc., and troops stationed on Isle of <placeName reg="Hope Island, Skagit, Washington" key="tgn,2398747">Hope</placeName> and <placeName reg="Whitemarsh Island, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2024717">Whitmarsh islands</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Our newly-erected fortifications on the land side of the city were very strong and capable of turning back almost any kind of assault, though they were not commenced till after <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had nearly reached <placeName key="tgn,2023617" n="1.000 65" reg="milledgeville, baldwin, georgia">Milledgeville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/><orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> appeared before these works about the <dateStruct value="--08"><day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="9">9th instant</day></dateStruct>, and on <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="10">10th</day></dateStruct>, considerable fighting occurred. --Several severe assaults were made, in which the enemy were signally repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Early on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th</day></dateStruct>, a tremendous cannonading began and was kept up for half the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He was scarce of ammunition and had no heavy guns, as well as other difficulties in the way of his giving battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>During the siege, severe assaults were several times made on particular points, with a view of storming our works and breaking through our lines, but all these were handsomely repulsed. </p> </q><bibl n="The Charleston Courier"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> On <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="17">17th instant</day></dateStruct>, a flag of truce was sent in by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, demanding the surrender of the city; and on <date>Sunday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct>, a reply was given by <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, refusing to comply with the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, the evacuation commenced &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> squad coming out about mid-day; another came out at <time value="4pm">4 P. M.</time>, and <num value="2">two</num> others at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>How rapidly the evacuation was thereafter conducted, I know not, except from reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It is said the evacuation took place on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. I fear all our soldiers did not get out. Some of them were <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure> from the city, while many were <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> off. The heaviest fighting of the siege took place on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> and night, the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The enemy were repulsed in all their attempts on our lines; so the soldiers must have been there, and not on the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>If so, I cannot perceive how it is possible for all to have come off by <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, though they may have done so. We had several boats, capable of carrying from <num value="500">five hundred</num> to <num value="1000">one thousand</num> each across the river at a trip, and a pontoon bridge besides. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> Very few of the citizens left the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Many would have done so if they could, but the realization of their condition came too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It found them all unprepared, and escape impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>There was no alternative but to submit to their terrible fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>It does seem to me that our military authorities should, by some means, have given some notice or hint to the people, or time allowed those who desired to do so either to get away or set their houses in order if they intended to stay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Perhaps I am wrong in this conclusion &mdash; I will not say positively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>As before stated, the people were in the dark as to what was going on. They hoped we would be able to force <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,William,Tecumsch,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to the coast, either to the right or to the left, and save the city, and, in this belief, very little private property of any description was sent off. Neither of the newspaper offices were removed, and all the material of both, including a considerable supply of paper, fell into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>If they remain there long, we may expect soon to have them issuing <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers from the offices of those hitherto substantial Southern journals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The last issue of the <hi rend="italics">News</hi> was on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="10">10th instant</day></dateStruct>. --The enemy had cut all the railroads and telegraphic wires, thus cutting off any outside information by mail or otherwise, and the military authorities desired nothing concerning the situation, or what was there taking place, to be made public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Under these circumstances the paper was stopped, and the editor and printers went into service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs></hi> continued to issue <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> sheet, but it contained no news, either local or from abroad, and was, under the circumstances, the most unsatisfactory newspaper that I ever tried to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>I never witnessed such a forcible illustration of the value of newspapers in a community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Everybody was in a state of suspense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>There was a pretty general hope that the city would be saved, but no <num value="1">one</num> could give any substantial reason for this hope, having no certain grounds upon which to base it; and ignorance of the real condition kept them from arriving at a different conclusion and preparing for the worst. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> All was uncertainty and doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Hope was mingled with fear, and it was difficult for any <num value="1">one</num> to decide which preponderated in his own mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Every man, when he met his neighbor, inquired, and was inquired of, after the news, and </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> neither could gratify the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>All were the victims of every imaginable kind &mdash; rumor and opinion, from the best to the worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>I hope never to pass through such dreadful days again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Such suspense is worse agony than any reality, be it ever so dreadful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The only intelligence from <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah, Georgia</placeName>, from Southern sources, since its evacuation, is the following, from the <rs>Augusta</rs> <hi rend="italics">Register:</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>So far as our informant had observed, citizens were unmolested and all private property respected. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> All reasoning which concedes the early abolition of slavery assumes that the <rs>South</rs> cannot gain its independence by the unaided efforts of its white population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>If it can, slavery will be abolished when the <rs>South</rs> pleases; which will not be in this generation, nor the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Let us assume, then, that the time is not distant when Southern arms will give way before Northern valor, unless some new element enters into the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Meanwhile, steps are taken for extinguishing slavery by an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>What will be the consequence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Why, clearly this: that the <rs>South</rs>, seeing that the fall of slavery is inevitable, will anticipate our action and get beforehand with us in its abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>That a majority of the negroes will prefer their old homes and associations in the sunny climate of the <rs>South</rs> is next to certain; and the rebel army will have nearly as many fresh blacks to draw on for recruits as they had whites at the beginning of the war. To say that this will have no tendency to prolong the contest, and render the final result doubtful, is to talk superlative nonsense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>If, as the <name>Abolitionists</name> contend, the emancipation proclamation prevented <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> recognition, it logically follows that (the disposition of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> remaining the same) recognition would speedily follow the abolition of slavery by the <rs>South</rs>; and all the more certainly from the increased military weight of the <rs>South</rs> when its able-bodied male negroes had been thrown into the scale. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The certainty, then, is as great as this kind of reasoning admits, that the passage of the constitutional amendment would cause the <rs>South</rs> to offer up the doomed institution on the altar of independence, and that fortune would be so far propitiated by the sacrifice as to enable them to prolong the struggle and win a recognition in the family of nations. </p>
