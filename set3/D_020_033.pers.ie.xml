<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> <foreign lang="fre">the <rs>La Vendre</rs></foreign> of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> and the proper policy for its conquest. </p> </argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> To this time, in every conflict of arms between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern forces, the balance of victory and of glory, and also of solid advantages, has been on the side of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>--with <num value="1">one</num> class of exceptions only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>These exceptions have been presented in the several skirmishes and some important conflicts, and other defeated movements, in the <rs>Northwestern</rs> part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In this region, beginning with the earliest and most culpable neglect by our State authorities, by which the enemy was permitted to take and keep possession of the <num value="2">two</num> great railroads entering that region from the <rs>Ohio</rs> &mdash; through the consequent disastrous defeats of our forces under the imbecile <rs>Porterfield</rs>, and still worse under the brave and capable <persName n="Pegram,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Pegram,nomatch:0"><surname>Pegram</surname></persName> and <persName n="Garnett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Garnett,nomatch:0"><surname>Garnett</surname></persName> &mdash; to the latest event, the unavoidable retreat of <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>--all have been <num value="1">one</num> unchanging series of disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>And various in kind as have been these disasters, and their immediate or special causes, there is <num value="1">one</num> great and abiding cause for all &mdash; in the disaffection of a large portion of the residents to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and the natural features of the country, which enable the zealous and active residents successfully to oppose and to overcome any inactive military force to which they are heartily and earnestly opposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Instead of continuing to oppose by military invasion, and attempting to crush, this rebellion of the <rs>Virginia</rs> tories and traitors, (who give all the strength of the <rs>Northern</rs> armies,) I would respectfully suggest a different policy, which would serve, safely and effectually, to assail, and gradually and surely to extinguish, (unless in the <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Pan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Pan,nomatch:0"><surname>Pan</surname></persName>-Handle,&#x0022;</q>) the existing disposition of the residents to favor the desposic and oppressive Northern power, and to oppose, as now through ignorance, the benefits of union with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The policy proposed is the withdrawing of our armies and armaments from the whole of the disaffected and contaminated region between the <rs type="place">Alleghany Mountains</rs> and the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName> &mdash; to guard the <rs>Alleghany</rs> passes, and constantly to threaten the region in question, but without seriously assailing it, so as to compete the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> to retain therein some <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> or <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men, as costly and burdensome garrisons of their temporary conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>These garrisons, by their military license and outrages, would oppress the whole occupied country, and their friends as well as foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The heavy system of taxation now about to be imposed on all the possessed dominions and subjects of the <rs>Northern</rs> power would be intolerable to this community of heretofore independent and generally poor inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Their entire loss of trade, and of all other prior great advantages, then terminated by separation from, and the hostile relations with, the remainder of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and of all the other States of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, would be not less injurious and burdensome than the heavy taxation and military requisitions of the <rs>Northern Rump Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It thus let alone, under the operation of these several influences, before half a year would pass these now servile Submissionists and Tories, and even many now active traitors, would become heartily sickened with Northern rule and fraternization, and be more ready to break out in insurrection against the <rs>Northern</rs> power than to aid, or even to submit to it. Then would be our time to aid the popular impulse, instead of vainly opposing it by arms, as heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Then, supporting, and supported by the restored proper understanding of self-interest of the now deceived inhabitants &mdash; and the always sound patriotism of the loyal and true &mdash; it will be as easy and cert in to subdue and subject the persistent tories and traitors of the <rs>Northwestern</rs> counties, as it has been, and still will be, difficult, by the military and yet impotent policy heretofore pursued by the authorities of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Then will be the time for us to crush and to punish the unyielding traitors and rebels &mdash; to pardon the repentant, and to reward the always true and previously suffering patriots. </p> <closer> <signed>Peter the <name>Hermit</name>.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> It may be easy for us to prove what number may have been stolen at this or that farm, or sent off and sold from this or that fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It is not so easy, however, to identify what particular negroes were stolen by what particular <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In enforcing reparation for our stolen property, the evidence as to the above most important points may be difficult to obtain &mdash; It is feared almost impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> It seems that enactments might be so framed as to allow our negroes to bear witness in the cases above referred to. Laws for admitting their evidence might be so guarded as to be in no way prejudicial to <hi rend="italics">us,</hi> while our property would be so much better protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We should have no compunction as to enabling Old Virginia negroes to tell what they know about <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> thieves who have desolated our borders, and to whom our negroes are far superior, morally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The following is the language of <persName n="Harvey,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harvey</surname></persName>: <q>&#x0022;The fact is, the <rs>Government</rs> was in possession of every tittle of the evidences which had accumulated in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, long before the public seizure was ordered, several weeks before I left there, and before I had received or accepted my commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>If there was anything to know, it was known fully and entirely, as will be shown whenever necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>I assert the fact distinctly, without condition or reservation.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> The correspondent of a New York paper, writing from the above place, gives the following description of a poor fellow who was executed for arson: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> The criminal, dressed in a loose white cotton robe, and bound hand and foot, was placed on horseback and paraded through the principal streets of the native quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>He was escorted by a large posse of police, soldiers and officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Inscribed on a banner, carried directly in front of him, were particulars of his history, his crime and its punishment.--The poor fellow, reduced to a skeleton by long confinement, and bearing the marks of harsh treatment, was as object an object as <num value="1">one</num> might see. Passing out of the town, he was conducted to a hill in the open country, a lovely spot overlooking fair fields, gardens in-numerable, and the placid bay, where a space of <num value="0.5">a half</num> acre's extent was enclosed by ropes, within which the stake, the faggots and the fire awaited their victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Shortly before reaching this spot the procession halted in a shady lane by an old deserted temple, where, with mock humanity, the prisoner was fed with better viands than he had tasted for many a day, and plied bountifully with rice whiskey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> On reaching the enclosed space of the execution ground &mdash; in sight of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of spectators, who trampled down roods of ripening grain in their eagerness &mdash; the criminal was lashed to the state with straw cords, which, in turn, were plastered with mud to prevent their burning prematurely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>While his head was thus being secured by cords passed around his neck, it was evident that the little life remaining in his emaciated form was mercifully strangled into near insensibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>During all these preparations the victim exhibited no emotion, no interest in what was going on. The officials appointed to superintend the execution sat looking on in true Japanese stoicism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> <q>&#x0022;We are very short, let us stand in front,&#x0022;</q> said <num value="2">two</num> black-teethed women to the pressing crowd, who, however, yielded not. Yet the demeanor of the throng was free from rudeness; there seemed to be no levity or jibes at the poor prisoner's fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/><q>&#x0022;It is an ugly sight &#x0022;</q> they said, and looked on in silence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> Bundies of a long, well-dried rush were now heaped about and above the man till he was covered out of sight; and then fire was applied simultaneously in several places, and in a moment the flames leaped hot and fierce into the air, and death must have been as instantaneous as under the headsman's axe --more so than in the hangsman's rope.--Within <measure n="2minutes" type="date">two minutes</measure> the rushes had burned away, and the scorched, lifeless form of the man alone remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Lighted faggots were then applied to mouth and nostrils, to make assurance sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The head executioner, kneeling before the seated officials, reported the deed accomplished and while executioners, officers and spectators filed away, the blackened corpse was left standing <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> a public spectacle and warning. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Before daylight on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num>, we were aroused by the firing of our pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Being formed in line of battle, our regiment by sunrise was lying upon the ground directly in front of the bridge, and covered by the brow of the sharp hill to the left of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Soon after sunrise, the long straight turnpike upon the opposite side of the <rs type="place">Run</rs> was filled with the columns of the enemy as far as the eye could reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>They came within <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure> of us, threw out their skirmishers, and opened a battery upon us, feeling with ball and shell around and over the hill to find our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Our regiment remained here with no other firing except between our skirmishers and those of the enemy, until about <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, under the immediate supervision of <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>, whose headquarters were within <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> of our position. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>With drawing without the knowledge of the army in our front, and which was composed of <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men, we commenced a double quick to meet the column which had crossed above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>After accomplishing a mile or more, we came in sight of their long line of bayonets, glistening in the morning sun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The enemy formed on a commanding hill, <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure> in front, and opened upon us with a heavy fire of musketry, and grape-shot from the <orgName type="mil" key="RIBattery">Rhode Island Battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Both the <name>Louisianians</name> and our regiment returned the fire with spirit, and several of our men were killed and wounded thus early in the day, or before <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> Soon afterwards, we received an order to form under cover of a wood to our right, and somewhat nearer the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Here we remained for some time, in the edge nearest the enemy, keeping up our fire, and having many of our men killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> With this noble regiment, which has been deservedly spoken of for its gallantry, we retired when the fire became too hot to be withstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>We, however, soon rallied, and returned to the fight, remaining in it through-out the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>These pieces were, I believe, taken several times before we finally succeeded in holding them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>This much I have thought should be said, in justice to the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 4">4th Regiment</orgName> and the <rs>Louisiana</rs> battalion, without in the least intending to detract from any other command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Where all did nobly, comparison would be odious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>In the spring of <date value="1827">1827</date> I was spending an extra vacation in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and thus I witnessed the mobbing of this great man. I suppose you have thought the <rs>Iron Duke</rs> had only successes, and lauciations, and honors in this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Not so. He had not been the <rs>Iron Duke</rs>, if he had not been hardened by moral conflict, as well as by warlike compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>At the time I was in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> the <rs>Duke</rs> had given his voice for <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> emancipation, consequently he had made himself obnoxious to the bigoted rabble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Sectarian preachers preached against him day and night, from pulpit, stand and stump, about treason, Popery, and the like, until the poor ignorant masses imagined that they must be bitted and bridled by a Pope and Priesthood, and to the death, if <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholics</rs> were treated like human beings.--<persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00337" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> had thrown his great influence in the scale for emancipation; consequently, the mob determined to revenge what they considered their wrongs on him. The animas of a mob is more frequently a mistake than a wickedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/><num value="1">One</num> morning in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> I noticed threatening crowds near the <rs>Pall Mail</rs> gate, not far from the statue of <persName n="Achilles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00338" reg="mostcommon:Achilles,nomatch:0"><surname>Achilles</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>This statue was cast from cannons taken in the <rs>Iron Duke</rs>'s various battles, and was dedicated <q>&#x0022;To <persName n="Arthur,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="mostcommon:Arthur,nomatch:0"><surname>Arthur</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Duc">Duke</rs> of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, by the <name>Women</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> I determined to watch the <rs>Duke</rs>, and see what was going to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Punctual to the moment, he descended the steps of the <rs type="place">Apsely House</rs>, his residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>His appearance was imposing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>He was at the head of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, Premier of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and he was, <hi rend="italics">par excellence,</hi> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> men in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/> I was drizzy morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>He wore a blue flock coat, buttoned up to the chip, a military stock, and brown pan aloons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>His falcon eye surveyed the excited groups about the <rs>Park</rs> gate, with a sort of pleasant contempt.--The mob were either awed by his appearance and prestige, or they had not yet screwed their courage to the insulting point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The <rs>Duke</rs> passed on horseback, attended by his faithful valet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Nobody molested him till he reached his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>There the mob hissed him, hat when he turned around and faced them, the hissing ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>He then quietly entered his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>As I knew the hour he would leave <address><street n="Downing street">Downing street</street></address> to return to the <rs>Park</rs>, I was there in due season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The neighborhood of the <rs>Horse Guards</rs> probably deterred a good many of the excited fanatics from gathering about the <rs type="place">Office</rs>, but numbers were gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>The <rs>Duke</rs>, who was punctuality itself, came on at the appointed moment and mounted his house, amid groans and hisses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>After he passed the <rs>Horse Guards</rs>, the rotes increased to shouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>When he passed Charling Cross and entered Pall Mall, the mob began to throw missiles and dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Near Pall Mall gate, there was a whirlpool of human beings eddying round in strange, wild, and yet in a sort of symmetrical confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>I feared they would mercer him there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>As he approached the gate, a good deal spattered with mud and dirt, the mob, as if compelled by some higher power then that of earth, made a lane for him to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>For a moment he was very pear them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>For that moment they seemed awed, and appeared to relent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>But when he had entered the gate, their violence rose to fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>He dismounted with difficulty, placed his back against the rails of the statue of Achilies, and calmly faced his furious assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>I shall never forget that moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Thoughts and feelings took a mastery of my nature then, that have swayed me ever since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> word did he utter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>There was no shrinking &mdash; not even a cloud of apprehension upon that glorious face Oh, how infinitely small and contemptible his assailants looked!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>How great is man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>How little are men! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> There was a full in the storm of shouts and missiles and dirt, and an old <name>Irishman</name>, with a wooden peg, hustled his way to the side of the <rs>Duke</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>This man sold apples and oranges by <placeName reg="Hyde Park, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015004">Hyde Park</placeName> gate, and his basket had been upset by the mob. When he had reached the <rs>Iron Duke</rs> he stood by his side, and unbound his wooden leg, and made a speech that immediately subdued the monsters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>He began: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> <q>&#x0022;My curse on you for cowardly scoundrels!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/> The speech was a mighty success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>The mob was a shamed and calmed, and began to speak away.
