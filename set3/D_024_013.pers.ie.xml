<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Again he advanced, with larger numbers and greater desperation than before, and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s men were compelled to give ground.--It was only for a moment, however.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> It was a few minutes after <num value="8">eight</num> when this occurred, and at the same time the sun broke forth through some cold-looking clouds, and flashed a clear, bright light over the field. --There had not elapsed even time to remove the body of the dead <persName n="Sill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Sill,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sill</surname></persName>, when all attention was directed to the extreme right. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was not his fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A <unclear>ters</unclear> better, braver young man, is seldom found than lie. It was his greatest ambition to take part in a battle; and I remember well how often and how earnestly he deplored that separation from the old <orgName type="division" n="division 3">3d division</orgName>, which prevented him from taking part in the battle of <placeName reg="Perryville, Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2576569">Perrysville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> His hour came at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It found him ready; but those upon whom he had a right to rely to give him timely notice of the enemy's arrival, failed to do so, and ere his guns could be loaded and discharged <num value="3">three</num> times, the rebel bayonets had swept away his men, and he himself fell wounded and bleeding into the hands of the foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The gallant and earnest <persName n="Simonson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Simonson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Simonson</surname></persName> fought like a hero as he is, and brought off all but <num value="2">two</num> of his guns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The enemy succeeded in getting the right flank completely hemmed in. A large number of officers of every grade were shot down while standing almost at the muzzles of the rebel muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The brigades and regiments rushed upon <num value="1">one</num> another in disgraceful disorder, and the rout of the division became irretrievable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> I suppose I shall raise a storm about my head for saying so, but I can't, from all that I have heard, come to any other conclusion than that the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of the army was completely surprised, and that, too, under circumstances which should have rendered it particularly careful and vigilant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Whether <persName n="McCook,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:McCook,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McCook</surname></persName> or <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> is to blame, this impartial investigation will hereafter determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>At present the sentiment of the entire army is extremely hostile to both, and I imagine it will not be many days before there are important changes in leadership of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 14">fourteenth army corps</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Brigade after brigade, battery after battery, from <persName n="Palmer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Palmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Palmer</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Negley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Negley,nomatch:0"><surname>Negley</surname></persName>'s, and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Roussean,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Roussean,nomatch:0"><surname>Roussean</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName> were sent into the midst of the thickets to cheek the progress of the foe and rally the fugitives, but all in turn were either crushed by the flying crowds, broken by the impetuosity of the foe, and put to confused flight, or compelled to retire and extricate themselves in the best manner that seemed to offer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The history of the combat in those dark cedar thickets will never be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No man could see even the whole of his regiment, and no <num value="1">one</num> will ever be able to tell who they were that fought bravest, and they who proved recreant to their trust. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> I know there was some cowardice displayed, but I know, too, that there was shown by many officers and regiments as lofty a heroism as that which distinguished and immortalized the followers of <persName n="Godfrey,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Godfrey,nomatch:0"><surname>Godfrey</surname></persName> or the <name>Cid</name>; but, in spite of heroism and devotion, in spite of desperate struggles which marked every fresh advance of the foe, in spite of awful sacrifice of life on the part of the officers and soldiers of the <rs>Union</rs> army, the rebels still steadily pushed forward and came nearer to the turnpike. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Nearly <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two miles and a half</measure> the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of our army had been driven, and faintness of heart came over me as the destruction of our whole army seemed to stare us in the face. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The right of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, assailed at the same time as <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,William,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s, gave way simultaneously, and the rout of the remainder seemed to follow as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This left to <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> the task of repelling the hitherto successful onset of the foe. Never did man labor more faithfully than he to perform his task, and never was a leader seconded by more gallant soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> His division formed a kind of pivot upon which the broken <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> turned in its flight, and its perilous condition can be easily imagined when the flight of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> left it without any protection from the triumphant enemy, who now swarmed upon its front and right flank; but it fought until a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of its number lay bleeding and dying upon the field, and till both remaining brigade commanders, <persName n="Roberts,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Roberts,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonels</roleName> <surname>Roberts</surname></persName> and <persName n="Schaeffer,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Schaeffer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel"></roleName><surname>Schaeffer</surname></persName>, had men with the same fate of <persName n="Sill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Sill,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sill</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Then it gave way, and, as in almost every instance of the kind, retreat was changed to rout, only less complete than that of the troops of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,William,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> All these divisions were now hurled back together into the immense cedar thickets which skirt the turnpike, and were hurried over toward the right, and massed rank behind rank in an array of imposing grandeur along the turnpike and facing to the woods through which the rebels were advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The scene at this time was grand and awful as anything I ever expect to witness until the day of judgment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> I stood in the midst and upon the highest point of the somewhat elevated space, being between the turnpike and the railroad, and forming the key to our entire position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Let the rebels once obtain possession of it, and the immense mains of wagons parked along the turnpike, and the <rs>Union</rs> army was irretrievably ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Even its line of retreat would be cut off, and nothing could save it from utter rout, slaughter, and capture &mdash; and yet each minute it became more and more painfully evident that all the reinforcements which had been hurried into the woods to sustain and rally the broken wing and cheek the progress of the enemy in that direction, had proved inadequate to the task, and had in turn been overthrown by the great mass which was straggling in extricable disorder through the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Such sounds as proceeded from that gloomy forest of pines and cedars were enough to appal with terror the stoutest hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The roar of cannon, the crashing of shot through the trees, the whizzing and bursting of the shells, the uninterrupted rattle of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> muskets &mdash; all mingled in <num value="1">one</num> prolonged and tremendous volume of sound, as though all the thunders of Heaven had been rolled together, and each individual burst of celestial artillery had been rendered perpetual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Above it all could be heard the wild cheer of the traitorous host, as body after body of our troops gave way, and were pushed toward the turnpike. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> Nearer and nearer came the storm, louder and louder responded the tumult of battle &mdash; The immense train of wagons parked along the road suddenly seemed instinct with struggling life, and every species of army vehicle, preceded by frightened mules and horses, rolled and rattled away pell-mell in an opposite direction, pressing onward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It was a refusal to treat us as an independent Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>If we were independent States, the refusal to entertain with us the same international intercourse as was maintained with our enemy was unjust, and was injurious in its effects, whatever may have been the motive which prompted it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>This prohibition, directed with apparent impartiality against both belligerents, was in reality effective against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> alone, for they alone could find a hostile commerce on the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>And, more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: </p> </q><bibl n="President Lincoln,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> &#x0022;&#x0027;<hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the <name>States</name> and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of powers on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the gravest crimes.&#x0027;&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> Nor was this declaration of the want of power or disposition to interfere with our social system confined to a state of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Both before and after the actual commencement of hostilities the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> repeated in formal official communication to the <name>Cabinets</name> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> that he was utterly without constitutional power to do the act which he has just committed, and that in no possible event, whether the secession of these States resulted in the establishment of a separate Confederacy or in the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, was there any authority by virtue of which he could either restore a disaffected State to the <rs>Union</rs> by force of arms or make any change in any of its institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>I refer especially for verification of this assertion to the dispatches addressed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under direction of the <rs>President</rs>, to the <rs>Ministers</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, under date of <date value="1861-04-22">10th and 22nd April, 1861.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> The people of this Confederacy then cannot fall to receive this proclamation as the frailest vindication of their own sagacity in foreseeing the need to which the dominant party in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> intended from the beginning to apply their power, nor can they cease to remember, with devout thankfulness, that it is to their own vigilance in resisting the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stealthy progress of approaching despotism that they owe their escape from consequences now apparent to the most skeptical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>This proclamation will have another salutary effect in calming the fears of those who have constantly evinced the apprehension that this war might end by some reconstruction of the old Union or some renewal of close political relations with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>There fears have never been shared by me, nor have I ever been able to perceive on what basis they could rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>But the proclamation affords the fullest guarantee of the impossibility of such a result; it has established a state of things which can load to but <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="3">three</num> possible consequences; the extermination of the slaves, the exile of the whole white population from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, or absolute and total separation of these States from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> This proclamation is also an authentic statement by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of its inability to subjugate the <rs>South</rs> by force of arms, and as such must be accepted by neutral nations, which can no longer find any justification in withholding our just claims to formal recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>It is also in effect an intimation to the people of the <rs>North</rs> that they must prepare to submit to a separation now become inevitable; for that people are too sent not to understand that a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> has been rendered forever impossible by the adoption of a measure which, from its very nature, neither admits of retraction nor can no exist with union. </p> </div4>

<head>The public debt &mdash; taxation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/> Among the subjects to which your attention will be specially devoted during the present session you will no doubt deem the acceptation of some comprehensive system of finance as being of paramount importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The increasing public debt, the great augmentation in the volume of the currency, with its necessary concomitant of extravagant prices for all articles of consumption, the want of revenue from a taxation adequate to support the public credit, all unite in admonishing us that energetic and wise legislation alone can prevent serious embarrassment in our monetary affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>It is my conviction that the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> will freely meet taxation on a scale adequate to the maintenance of the public credit and the support of their Government.--When each family is sending forth its most precious ones to meet exposure in camp and death in battle, what ground can there be to doubt the disposition to devote a tithe of its income and more, it more be necessary to provide the <rs>Government</rs> with means for ensuring the comfort of its defenders?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>If our enemies submit to an excise on every commodity they produce and to the daily presence of the tax gatherer, with no higher motive than the hope of success in their wicked designs against us the suggestion of an unwillingness on the part of this people to submit to the taxation necessary for the success of their defence is an imputation on their patriotism that few will be disposed to make, and that none can justify. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The legislation of your last session intended to hasten the funding of outstanding Treasury nates, has proved beneficial as shown by the returns annexed to the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>But it was neither sufficiently prompt nor far-reaching to meet the full extent of the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The passage of some enactment, carrying still further the policy of that law by fixing a limitation not later than the <date value="07-01">1st July</date> next to the delay allowed for funding the notes issued prior to the <date value="1862-12-01">1st December, 1862, </date> will in the opinion of the <rs>Secretary</rs>, have the effect to draw from circulation nearly the entire sum issued previous to the last named date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>If to this be added a revenue from adequate taxation, and a negotiation of bonds guaranteed proportionately by the several States, as has already been generously proposed by some of them in enactments spontaneously adopted, there is little doubt that we shall see our finances restored to a sound and satisfactory condition, our circulation relieved of the redundancy now productive of so many mischiefs, and our credit placed on such a basis as to relieve us from further anxiety relative to our resources for the prosecution of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/> It is true that at its close our debt will be large; but it will be due to our own people, and neither the interest nor the capital will be exported to distant countries, impoverishing ours for their benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>On the return of peace the untold wealth which will spring from our soil will render the burthen of taxation far less onerous than is now supposed, especially if we take into consideration that we shall then be free from the large and steady dram of our substance to which we were subjected in the late Union through the instrumentality of sectional legislation and protective tariffs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> A recommend to your earnest attention the whole report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> on this important subject, and trust that your legislation on it will be delayed no longer than may be required to enable your wisdom to devise the proper measures for insuring the accomplishment of the objects proposed. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>In the <name>Report</name> of the <rs>Secretary</rs>, herewith submitted, will be found a summary of many memorable successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>The wisdom and efficacy of these acts have been approved by results, and the like spirit of unity, endurance, and self devotion in the people, which has hitherto sustained their action, must be relief on to assure their enforcement under the continuing necessities of our situation.--The recommendations of the <rs>Secretary</rs> to this effect are tempered by suggestions for their amelioration, and the subject deserves the consideration of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>For the perfection of our military organization no appropriate means should be rejected, and on this subject the opinions of the <rs>Secretary</rs> merit early attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>It is gratifying to perceive that, under all the efforts and sacrifices of war, the power, means and resources of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for its successful prosecution are increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Dependence on foreign supplies is to be deplored, and should, as far as practicable, be obviated by the development and employment of internal resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The peculiar circumstances of the country, however, render this difficult, and require extraordinary encouragements and facilities to be granted by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>The embarrassments resulting from the limited capacity of the railroads to afford transportation, and the impossibility of otherwise commanding and distributing the necessary supplies <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> for the armies, render the control of the roads under some general supervision, and resort to the power of impressment, military exigencies.--While such powers have to be exercised, they should be guarded by judicious provisions against perversion or abuse, and be, as recommended by the <rs>Secretary</rs>, under due regulation of law. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/> Our Government born of the spirit of freedom and of the equality and independence of the <name>States</name>, could not have survived a selfish or jealous disposition making each only careful of its own interest or safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>The fate of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> under the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, depends upon the harmony, energy and unity of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>It especially devolves on you their representatives, as far as practicable, to reform abuses to correct errors to cultivate fraternity and to sustain in the people a just confidence in the <rs>Government</rs> of their choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>To that confidence and to the unity and self-sacrificing patriotism hitherto displayed is due the success which has marked the unequal contest, and has brought our country into a condition, at the present time, such as the most sanguine would not have ventured to predict at the commencement of our struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Our armies are larger, better disciplined, and more thoroughly armed and equipped than at any previous period of the war. The energies of a whole nation, devoted to the single object of success in this war, have accomplished marvels and many of our trials have, by a beneficent <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, been converted into blessings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>The magnitude of the perils which we encountered have developed the true qualities and illustrated the heroic character of our people, thus gaining for the <rs>Confederacy</rs> from its birth a just appreciation from the other nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>The injuries resulting from the interruption of foreign commerce have received compensation by the development of our interest resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Cannon crown our fortresses that were cast from the produces of mines opened and furnaces built during the war. Our mountain caved yield much of the nitre for the manufacture of powder, and promise increase of product.
