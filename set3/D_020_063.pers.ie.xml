<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">The prisoners.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --From the beginning of this war the <rs>Confederate</rs> and State Governments have exhibited a degree of humanity, forbearance, and mercy to their captured enemies which are without parallel in the history of a nation invaded and threatened as the <rs>South</rs> has been, and which has neither been imitated by the <rs>North</rs> in its treatment of Southern prisoners, nor appreciated by many of those who have been the objects of our compassion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> We conscientiously believe that if the case had been reversed, and the <rs>South</rs> had wantonly invaded the <rs>North</rs>, publishing in advance its intention to confiscate property and commit violence upon women, not a prisoner would have been made, not a single life would have been spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>And we believe, moreover, that the <rs>North</rs> would have been right, as we believe that the <rs>South</rs> would have been, if a had pursued such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We are quite sure that the forbearance of the <rs>South</rs> has had no other effect than to exasperate and embolden a cowardly and cruel foe to fresh acts of barbarity and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Our prisoners put in irons and threatened with death; peaceable citizens arrested and sent to <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>; the proclamation of martial law in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, where every man who takes up arms for his freedom is menaced with instant death; the preparations to bombard and lay in ashes the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> upon the approach of a Confederate force; these, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> like instances of unexampled barbarity, show that the mild and merciful course of the <rs>Southern Government</rs> has been imputed to fear by men who themselves never abstain from evil except under the same principle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> It is not at all surprising that among the prisoners themselves there are men who feel no gratitude for the kindness which they daily receive, and who cherish towards the <rs>South</rs> the most bitter and vindictive feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>With the exception of officers of the old regular army, who are generally gentlemen, and can appreciate the courtesy which treats them as such, acts of compassion and indulgence to these prisoners are simply pearls cast before swine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Their volunteer officers especially are, in general, perfect caricatures of officers, knowing nothing of the art of war, and many of them ignorant of the decencies of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The original vocations of some of them were about the last from which anybody but <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle would ever have thought of manufacturing officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In short, few of the volunteer officers now in limbo were recognized at home as gentlemen, and cannot be expected to succeed in a character which they have never even attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We have enough of such cattle to feel perfectly sure that, if treated according to their deserts, they would be meek and humble as lambs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>At the same time, forbearance and humanity should still be exercised to these men, until the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> Government fulfills its threats of putting to death Southern prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It would be entirely consistent with this forbearance and humanity to make some disposition of the prisoners, which would abate the cost of their maintenance and increase the difficulties of their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>As our gallant privateersmen are immured in that foul criminal prison, the <name>Tombs</name>, of New York, we would suggest that the prisoners here be removed to the <name>Penitentiary</name>, which is the spacious, cleanly and comfortable building, and that the inmates of the <name>Penitentiary</name> be employed upon the fortifications for the city defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We do not desire to wound the feelings of the convicts, by proposing to give their quarters to a much more degraded class of men than themselves; but the public interests would be benefited by such an arrangement, and they have surely patriotism enough to reconcile them to the mortification which, under the circumstances, they might naturally feel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We are all obliged to make sacrifices for our country, and we dare say that the inmates of the <rs>Virginia Penitentiary</rs> are willing to shoulder their share of the general self-denial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They are not without interest in the result of this war. If the country should be subjugated by our <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invaders, the regular business of the penitentiary convicts will be entirely destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Before <num value="1">one</num> of them can graduate, every horse in the country will be stolen, and every Southern man robbed and murdered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Let them volunteer, then, <hi rend="italics">en masse,</hi> to give the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners their places in the <name>Penitentiary</name>, and betake themselves to the fortifications, where they can keep the country from being overrun and their various professions from being over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> volunteers who composed his legion resembled in many respects our <orgName n="Southern Volunteers" type="volunteers">Southern volunteers</orgName>--they were composed of the very <hi rend="italics">clite</hi> of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>: the nobility, the gentry, the professors, the educated men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> The <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Logan</rs>, since the commencement of our troubles, has been of invaluable service to our cause, (especially in this department,) in transporting not only troops and munitions of war, but in accommodating the traveling public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Now, this much set forth, I wish &mdash; not as a personal friend to the steamer or owner, but as a friend to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause and to the traveling public, composed both of soldiers and friends visiting them &mdash; to call your attention to a better schedule, provided the railroad will only be a little accommodating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> Now, there is only <num value="1">one</num> connexion on <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 24" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the <num value="1">one</num> from <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, leaving the <rs>Richmond</rs> passengers to lie over at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> all night and a large part of the day. The railroad, I understand, is unwilling to make any change at all &mdash; thinks the steamer ought to do all. I am of a different opinion, and for the reason that, to let the railroad continue its present schedule, would necessarily compel the boat to lie at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> all night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>To keep up steam is an expense &mdash; a waste of money &mdash; and, to say the least, very injudicious, wearing out rapidly the fixtures of the steamer. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> An hour ago, as I came upon the <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> road, I called on <persName n="Walton,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="nearbymention:Walton,Fannie,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Walton</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, from whom I learned that a battle took place yesterday in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Munson's hill">Munson's hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Early in the morning, information was brought in that the <rs>Federals</rs> in strong force were crossing by the <rs type="place">Cham Bridge</rs> for the purpose of attacking our advance, and of driving us from the present commanding position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/><persName n="Rosser,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Company">second company</orgName> of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, having <num value="4">four</num> guns, <num value="2">two</num> rifled cannon, and <num value="2">two</num> howitzers, were sent out to engage them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Their battery was supported by <num value="3">three</num> companies of infantry, of <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Kemper,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="mostcommon:Kemper,J.,L.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Kemper</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName>, consisting of <num value="308">three hundred and eight</num> men, and a small body of cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> The Federals were met at Louvansville, <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia" key="tgn,2111722">Falls Church</placeName></placeName>, and about the same distance from the bridge, where a sharp and decisive battle commenced, which, from the number of men engaged, may be ranked a little above the usual skirmishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The distance of the enemy, and the careful manner in which they concealed all their movements, prevents us from ascertaining accurately the number of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but it is certain they had <num value="2">two</num> batteries, containing <num value="8">eight</num> guns, some <num value="2800">twenty-eight hundred</num> or <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men, and considerable cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/> The fight commenced with the artillery at long range, the shots from the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington artillery</orgName> falling with great accuracy into the ranks of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>What the effect of these shots were is not known, and, on account of the skill of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in concealing disagreeable facts, probably never will be; but during the engagement <persName n="Rosser,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName> and his men fired <num value="66">sixty-six</num> rifle shots--<num value="45">forty-five</num> spherical case, <num value="17">seventeen</num> shell and <num value="3">three</num> canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Considering the precision with which this company have heretofore sent their missiles at the enemy, and the number of shots fired, it may be safely supposed that the <rs>Federal</rs> loss was by no means slight, and that the battle was of some duration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/> The enemy also used their guns and fired shot after shot in quick succession, but fired badly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>It was another artillery duel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>That our fire was having its effect soon became apparent, for they gradually fled from their guns, the infantry falling back, until a panic was created and there commenced another scene similar to the last act of drama on the <rs type="place">Plains of Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>There was a complete rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> fled in terror, throwing away their canteens and haversacks, which were dead weights in the race, and broke like quarter-horses for the <rs>Potomac</rs> and a spot of safety beyond it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/> They crossed again by the <rs type="place">Chain Bridge</rs>, bearing away their dead and wounded, but in the pursuit <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> bodies were seen by the roadside, which they were unable to carry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>As I have previously said, the number of men put <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">hors du combat </hi></foreign> will not be known probably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>None of the artillery on our side were injured, but there are rumors that <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of our infantry were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>How true this may be, I cannot say to-night; but can get farther particulars in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The facts as I have given them are from the official report of <persName n="Rosser,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, which <persName n="Walton,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="nearbymention:Walton,Fannie,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Walton</surname></persName> received this morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/> I learn since arriving in this village that some prisoners were captured just before the fight commenced, who were endeavoring to make their way to the advancing enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>A Lieutenant with a squad of men had been out scouting, and had obtained some information which would have been valuable had they escaped with it. These men are from <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Indiana</rs> regiments, and it is said that they were anxiously awaiting the termination of the fight, feeling entire confidence in the ability of their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> friends to release them.--These men are now in <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, and will be sent on to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 24" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to-morrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> At this time I am unable to learn what part the infantry or the cavalry took in the fight, but shall get more particulars to-morrow, when I can add additional facts and correct any misstatement that may have been made this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>As the facts are given, it will be seen that this little victory is <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant we have won in this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Hardly <num value="400">four hundred</num> men engage a force of <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, rout them, and drive them like whipped curs from their kennels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>They are doubtless so much exasperated by this galling defeat, that we may expect an attack here at any moment, when they will try to avenge themselves upon this division; but they will have to be very sharp, and do better fighting than they have done yet during the war, if their wishes are gratified in this respect.
