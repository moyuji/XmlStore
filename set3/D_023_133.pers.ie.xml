<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The forces engaged were the advance of the opposing armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The fight soon became severe, and the discharges of cannon were rapid and incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Both sides seemed determined to drive the other off the field, or at least not to yield an inch of the disputed territory, and for some hours our troops fight with the most desperate bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>At length however, it became evident that it was useless to contend longer against a superior force, not say in numbers, but in guns, and <persName n="Wheeler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> slowly withdrew his command to a point <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles distant</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We are indebted to a friend for files of Northern papers for a week previous to and including the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="17">17th ult.</day></dateStruct> They contain many items of interest not included in the latest papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We give a summary below: </p>

<head>The Northern press on the mediation <unclear> Ws</unclear> the &#x0022;Tribune&#x0022; is Clad the proposition is virtually Dead &mdash; the &#x0022;times&#x0022; Isn't Satisfied about <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> &mdash; the &#x0022;Herald&#x0022; Perfectly Contented.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Northern journals are discussing the late mediation news with much vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The position of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> attracts most of their attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The news from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by the <name>Arabia</name> settles the question of mediation and of intervention by the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Powers in our affairs for the present, at least, if not altogether <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> holds back, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> refuses, and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> alone is willing to interfere in what is none of her business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>That both <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> are wise, they, happily, are persuaded, and we are confident that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> will be led into the path of wisdom, though it may be against her will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Should the <rs>Emperor</rs> propose to adopt a policy in which he would find no backers in the other great Powers, it might possibly lead to new complications from which it might not be easy to extricate himself with honor and credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>So shrewd a ruler will not fail to foresee such a possibility, and conclude that the safer and wiser way is to let us alone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The apprehension of any interference on the part of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Powers in the war in this country has not of late been much felt; but so long as it remained a doubt it was a painful <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There will be a sense of relief now at its positive removal and the nation will feel all the stronger in the sense that it confronts all the possible difficulties of the case in the suppression, pure and simple, of the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion. </p> </q><bibl n="New York Tribune"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> remarks that <q>&#x0022;it is at last verified that the <rs>French Emperor</rs> has seriously meditated intervention, and has actually proposed to the <rs>English Government</rs> a joint offer of mediation to stop the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war;&#x0022;</q> and the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> then says: </p> <cit><q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>This disclosure is not in accordance with concurrent testimony from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> during the war and up to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>We had been led very generally to believe that no Government in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>' was more firmly fixed in the view of the utter impolicy of meddling with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> rebellion than that of the <rs>French</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>His has been not only the grovelling last of the demagogue for selfish elevation, but a Satanic determination to unmake his country if necessary to the making of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>He deliberately chose the demoralization and disorganization of society as the means of elevating himself, until he at last succeeded in undoing the work of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, and in rending the old Republic in fragments, that he might perch his dwarfish figure upon the colossal rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Other statesmen have identified their names with some measure which, in their opinion at least, promised to increase the greatness and glory of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>If he has any genius, it is for destructiveness, for pulling down not building up. He has the countenance of a vulture and the instincts of <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>He has sought to overthrow those Institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs> which had given wealth and power to the whole nation; but has he ever had the capacity to propose anything in their place?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Has he ever been able to suggest that anything but anarchy and ruin would be the result of his success?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Yet he has deliberately sought this result, and involved the whole land in war, to secure his own elevation to a position which he could never have obtained by legitimate means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It would be idle to deny that he is now virtually the <rs>President</rs>, but his triumph will not be complete till he is <rs type="role2">President</rs> in name as well as in fact, till the <rs>South</rs> is subjugated, and he rules by Northern votes and bayonets over the whole of the old Union. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>If the war of invasion should fail, the arch traitor will sink to a deep of infamy, even in his own section, compared with which the reputation of <persName n="Arnold,,Benedict,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="default:Arnold,Benedict,,,"><foreName>Benedict</foreName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName> is honor and renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>So far from being <rs type="role2">President</rs>, he would not be able to live in his own State, and might consider himself lucky if he escaped with his head to foreign exile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>No man is more sensible than himself of the personal consequences of failure, and it is to save himself from the gulf of perdition that yawns at his feet, that he is urging on with convulsive energy the blood- hounds of war. It is not the least of the many stimulants of the <rs>South</rs> to the most determined resistance, that the defeat of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be the personal and political ruin of the wicked author of the troubles we are suffering, who, keeping himself aloof from the trials and perils in which he has involved others, can receive no other retribution in this world than the final disappointment of that ambition which has led him to the perpetration of the most unparalleled crimes. </p> </div3>
