<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We have moved slowly, as the captain's instructions are to cross the bar early in the morning, and run up to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> at daybreak, and we wish to approach the harbor by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>This afternoon we stopped about <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure> from the bar for <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> or more, and had some fishing.--The day has been delightful, and our success in enticing unsuspecting bass was quite satisfactory. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Towards night we put on steam, anxious for the result of to-morrow morning's experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In the &#x0022;Recollections of a Zouave.&#x0022; I have read that on the morning of a battle the bravest soldier, while nothing would tempt him to be elsewhere, seriously wishes himself <measure n="18hours" type="date">eighteen hours</measure> older, and I doubt not that is now the prevailing sentiment on board the <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>At any rate we wish ourselves safely within the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, where, all hands say, we are bound to be in a few hours, unless we are in the bottom of <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> or prisoners of war. Every arrangement within the power of those in charge has been made to secure the success of the enterprise, and anxious interest increases every hour.--Every light has been extinguished; even our state-rooms are in utter darkness, and in the cabin we have only <num value="1">one</num> lantern, by the dim light of which <num value="1">one</num> of the officers has this evening been reading the <name>Adventures</name> of <persName n="Suggs,Captain,Simon,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Suggs,Simon,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Simon</foreName> <surname>Suggs</surname></persName>, for the entertainment of his companions.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The provisions have been brought up from below, and placed in the cabin and on deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I learned that we arrived in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> bar about midnight; that all the coast-lights had been extinguished, and that thus far it had been impossible to find the main channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is evident from these indications that the hospitable South <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> do not mean that we should go in without a salute. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> A light was seen off the coast, but we could not make out what it was. A little after <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> we discovered the light on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and with these exceptions everything was dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It was, of course, impossible to get over the bar without the light-house, and so we awaited the break of day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> I have never seen a finer morning than the <num value="1">one</num> which dawned upon us. The sky was clear, and the moon, a faint crescent of silver, had just arisen, and the low coast looked like a dense forest of evergreen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The spires of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> became visible in the approaching daylight, and on the walls of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> we descried the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag floating in the breeze. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Now, about <time value="6:30oclock">half-past 6 o'clock</time>, we see the light-house; and now, too, we discover that the mysterious light just mentioned was that of a steamer at our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Now the situation of the channel is ascertained and we are under way, and now the steamer at our right is burning <rs type="color">red</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> lights, and now she sends up rockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There is no mistaking her movements; she is giving the alarm signal to <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> On we go; the soldiers are below with loaded muskets and the officers are ready to give the word if there is anything to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The little steamer at our right is burning a signal light aft, and is making all possible headway up the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Now we discover a red <placeName key="tgn,2020752" n="1.000 1" reg="palmetto, manatee, florida">Palmetto</placeName> flag at our left on <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, at a little village called <placeName reg="Cummings Point, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2271638">Cummings' Point</placeName>, and apparently but little more than a mile from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> &#x0022;Is it possible that those fellows have got a battery off here?&#x0022; asks <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> &#x0022;No,&#x0022; answers another; &#x0022;There is no battery there.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> But there is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It plunges into the water and skips along, but falls short of our steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The line was forward of our bow, and was, of course, an invitation to stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But we are not ready to accept the proffered hospitality, and the <rs>Captain</rs> pays no attention to it, except to run up the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> at the masthead &mdash; the garrison flag mentioned before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The shot falls short of us a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> or more, and bounds clean over our vessel, aft, nearly on a line with the head of a sailor, but, luckily, a little above it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>again goes the heavy gun. The ball now strikes our ship in the fore chains, about <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> above the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>A seaman was holding the lead to take the soundings, and the ball struck directly under his feet.--It was not surprising that, under the circumstances, <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName> was strongly inclined to take to his heels, and he begins to scramble up with might and main, when the captain assures him that there is no danger, <num value="1">one</num> ball having struck so near him; on the principle, I suppose, that lightning never strikes twice in the same place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Taking it, then, as authority, what are we to think of the ethics which control the morality of the directors of the <rs>Northern</rs> offices, for which that paper speaks? </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/> &#x0022;In the event of civil war, there will be <num value="4">four</num> classes of assured persons in the <rs>Southern States</rs>: soldiers of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Policies of life insurances contain a provision in this form: &#x0027;Provided that the said---- shall, without the consent of this company, engage in any extra hazardous occupation, or shall, without such previous consent, enter into any military service whatsoever, (the militia not in active service excepted,) or in case he shall die by the hands of justice, or in the violation of any State, National or Provincial law, this policy shall be null and void.&#x0027;&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Commercial"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/> The <hi rend="italics">Commercial</hi> continues, that a soldier has a natural right to act upon the defensive against the attack of a mob, [which epithet it applies to the <hi rend="italics">soldiers of a seceding State,</hi>] and high legal authority declares that if killed so acting on the defensive, his policy of insurance would be binding upon the company issuing it. &#x0022;The officers of several companies,&#x0022; says the <hi rend="italics">Commercial,</hi> &#x0022;though generally doubting the legality of such claims, are disposed to meet them on the ground of patriotism and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The secessionists by acting against the <rs>Federal Government</rs> at once vitiate their claims, and the <hi rend="italics">patriotic citizens</hi> of the <rs>South</rs> are in no better position, <hi rend="italics">unless acting strictly on the defensive.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> This is a new expedient to alarm the <rs>South</rs> and intimidate resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>These soulless corporations, who have gotten the money of the <rs>South</rs>, have entered the field to war against the <rs>South</rs>; to encourage the soldiers who come to coerce Southern States, and to proscribe and injure those who are true to their allegiance to their State, to whom <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all their allegiance is due. Even a submissionist will not get his money on his insurance &#x0022;unless acting strictly on the defensive!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> But this is not the worst of the proclamation of these corporations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>The <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Commercial Advertiser" type="newspaper">Commercial Advertiser</orgName></hi> says: &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">The insurance on slaves would seem to be forfeited in any event;</hi>&#x0022; for in the utter chaos that would overwhelm the <rs>Southern States</rs> in the event of a civil contest, no claim for <rs n="life insurance" type="product">life insurance</rs> upon such policies could probably be collected.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/> It adds: &#x0022;It is safe, therefore, to suppose that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blast of actual war between the <rs>South</rs> and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would sweep away nearly <measure n="12000000dollars" type="currency">$12,000,000</measure> of Southern capital.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/> Thus we have a class of Northern corporations proposing deliberately to rob the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>What chaos at the <rs>South</rs> can exonerate these companies from paying the policies on these slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Their agents are accessible; the forms of claiming insurance under policies are plain and prescribed by themselves, and if the insured comply with them, how is it possible they can be honestly resisted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>If they are, it will be by open and unadulterated robbery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/> It is bad enough that these companies are to enter the arena to take sides against Southern seceding States, (of which it is possible <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> may be <num value="1">one</num>;) but to repudiate its obligations in the manner intimated by the <hi rend="italics">Advertiser,</hi> would be infamously dishonest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>We are clearly of opinion that every company endorsing this article of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Commercial Advertiser" type="newspaper">Commercial Advertiser</orgName></hi> should be allowed to have neither office nor agent in any Southern State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>We hope the matter will be looked into. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>The Legislature ought to see that all others who insure in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should not only occupy the same position, but should disclaim any intention to enter the field to combine for the disadvantage and injury of Southern people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The plan of war through these corporations, developed by the <hi rend="italics">Commercial,</hi> is cold-blooded and diabolical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>They are located in cities chiefly built up by Southern commerce, and whose people have waxed fat on Southern trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>They were, therefore, lined with iron, and worked gingerly for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>This reform had hardly been made, when the instrument was brought into prodigious activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>There was not a particle of evidence against her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/> At last the people in the neighborhood began to grow tired of these spectacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>They complained that after these wholesale executions, the blood of the criminals remained in pools, that the dogs came and drank it up, and that crowds of men fed their eyes on the spectacle, which, naturally, had a tendency to harden their hearts, and instigate them to ferocity and bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, during a procession of the <rs>Convention</rs>, the cattle which drew the vehicles absolutely refused to pass the blood-saturated spot, and neither blows nor coaxing could overcome their repugnance.
