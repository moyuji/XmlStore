<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> Business is dull in the grocery market, notwithstanding the high prices of almost all articles in that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The figures at which we quote Lime ought, we think, to be sufficiently large to induce our friends in the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs> and the <rs>Southwest</rs>, where limestone is as plenty as sand is in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and who can make us good Lime for building purposes, and indeed for anything but white washing, as can be found anywhere, at a trifling cost to themselves, to put up <num value="1000">thousands</num> of kilns, and get possession of the market now and hold it forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>They should also make, as there is no reason in the world why they should not, fine white Lime for whitewashing purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Cotton is likely to fluctuate in prices somewhat at the present time, it being the season for the new crop to commence coming in, and accordingly we have quoted it as ranging from <num value="12.5">12&#x00BD;</num> to <measure n="14cents" type="currency">14 cents</measure> in price, as in quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>If they knew this before, they affected to deny it, and sought persistently to disparage our wealth and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Since the commencement of hostilities they have gradually lost the entire commerce of the <rs>South</rs>, and they are well aware that if, for all future time, this vast source of opulence is forfeited by them, the mercantile marts of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the <rs>Middle States</rs> will be hopelessly ruined.
