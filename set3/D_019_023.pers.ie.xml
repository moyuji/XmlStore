<head>The crisis &mdash; its commercial aspect.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> In the present state of affairs, we should be derelict to duty were we to close our eyes to the certain results of those events which are now thronging rapidly upon the stage, unless they are arrested by a returning sense of reason and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We are compelled to contemplate, in all their aspects, the consequences of the current against which we are still struggling like desperate swimmers against an adverse tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>That tide may turn and bear us back to the placid pools where we have so long floated in peace and security; but, if not, we ought to look ahead and see what is before us. <num value="1">One</num> thing is certain &mdash; dissolution can bring no greater evils than any patched up peace, which leaves us subject to such frequent financial and political earthquakes as the present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> The merchants of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> alone have lost many <num value="1000">thousands</num>--we may safely say hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>--of dollars by the money panic which the election of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> has produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>When <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> exchange comes to be added to the payments due the <rs>North</rs>, we can begin, but only <hi rend="italics">begin,</hi> to understand the loss, and may start to computing the check to commerce which must follow these quadrennial political revulsions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It is not going too far to say that several merchants have already sustained an individual loss by derangements in their business of from <num value="25000">twenty-five</num> to <measure n="50000dollars" type="currency">fifty thousand dollars</measure>, not to mention what must follow from comparative inactivity for the next <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. The same remarks apply to manufactures, which are indeed but a branch of commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Look at the tobacco trade to-day &mdash; see men hiring hands in the dark, and see in that item, vast as it is to us, but a small fraction of the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Now, the confidence of merchants and manufacturers in the strength and ability of the present Government has been shaken, and in many cases utterly destroyed.--If without just guarantees to the <rs>South</rs>, this Government continues, they mean to operate in the future, either not at all, or so guardedly, and to such a limited extent, that the commerce of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, already crippled by the preference which our bankin system and general commercial policy operates in favor of the <rs>North</rs>--this commerce will be contracted to nothing, and we shall thus become the prey of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> capitalists, giving up all hope of making this a great commercial State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Our capitalists must retire to the country or be exiled from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> These men fear that any compromise now will be a fraud on the part of the <rs>North</rs>, and a mere delusion on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They know that the whole marrow of the dispute lies in this proposition: whether, by the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, <num value="1">one</num> man has a right to call another his slave, and hold him as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They know that the <rs>North</rs> does not admit that proposition, and, from whatever cause, will not admit it: and, <hi rend="italics">percontra,</hi> that the <rs>South</rs> claims it and acts upon it, and, to take no higher view, has <num value="1000000">millions</num> upon <num value="1000000">millions</num> invested in it. They know that, under our present Constitution, as differently construed by opposite sections, there is an irrepressible conflict between the system of Northern society, in which agrarianism, under the plausible and popular guise of universal suffrage, is ceaselessly warring against property and the system of Southern society, in which slavery unites, to a preponderating extent, both capital and labor in the same individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They know that the people of these sections heartily hate each other, and they fear that there can never be any real, cordial, reliable concord between them, even if their system harmonized, because <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> agitators will never cease to aim at power and office through the passions and antipathies of the populace, from whom all power is derived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> They know that the right of secession is denied at the <rs>North</rs>, and the policy as well as right of coercion insisted on there; and that to compromise now, under the present Constitution, without disposing of that question will only be to adjourn its settlement to some other, and not distant period, when it will be sure to arise and re-produce the convulsions that now prostrate them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> They know that any proposition to repeal the obnoxious Personal Liberty laws, as they are called, of the free States, is only a recommendation of a few Governors and other public functionaries, to people who will most probably not take the advice; but, who, if they do, will so violate their own consciences that they cannot be trusted; and who-can, and, as they believe, will, re-enact the same laws in a short time; and, lastly, that it will be of not the slightest benefit to repeal them, because long before they were enacted, mobs, in every State, and in nearly every instance in which a capture of a fugitive slave has been attempted, have by their conduct made such a law for themselves, and that they will do it again, because such is the tendency of their sympathies, and no free State is strong enough to control mobs acting in the direction of the public sympathies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> They know that a compromise now, in the inflamed state of sectional antagonisms and animosities, will not satisfy the body of the people either <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>; but that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName></hi> raids will show the discontent of <num value="1">one</num> section, whilst the revolutionary fire throughout the whole <rs>South</rs>, which may be smothered for a time, but cannot be extinguished, will keep them and the country in constant danger and dread of a sweeping conflagration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> They know that a united South is strong enough to maintain its independence of the <rs>North</rs>, and rich enough to make friends the world over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They know that in the present disturbance of commercial relations with the <rs>North</rs>, commerce has now made half the sacrifice that separation, even if attended with war, would exact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>They know that cotton is now rising, and held for a still higher rise, whilst supplies of all kinds from the <name>West</name> and <name>North</name>west are pouring into the more Southern cities in increased quantities, and at lower rates, because there is not money or credit enough in New York to buy them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> They know that the threats of <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> to raise armies are an idle menace, because they cannot equip, or subsist, or pay them, under a pecuniary system which, as it depends on commerce, manufactures, and the carrying trade, is in fact based on a credit which again rests on peace with us, their best customers by many <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>They know that we can raise armies and navies, because we can pay them from the avails of produce, which they cannot rob us of at home, or take from us on the high seas, without attacking their own ships or the commerce of nations more powerful than their own. They know that we are better armed now than the <rs>North</rs>, but may not be, when after this warning the <rs>North</rs> may put itself in case for war, and may present a more formidable front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They know that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> cannot do much harm to us now, because it is bankrupt; that if the officers and crews of returned vessels cannot get their pay, and money cannot be had even at <num value="0.12">12 per cent</num>, to keep its ordinary employees at work, that it cannot carry on a war against the <rs>South</rs>, because it must be a war against its own revenue, and therefore its own credit, but that both army and navy will waste away with famine, if they are not dissolved in mutiny, before they can strike <num value="1">one</num> great blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>And above all, for their purposes, they know that agitation, fluctuation, vacillation, is the death of commerce, and that commerce is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> temporal necessity of their lives, because it is the daily want of themselves, and what is more to them, of those who depend on them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> All these things they know perfectly well, as who does not that has opened his eyes, looked round, and reflected? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> What does commerce demand, then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We answer, commerce demands that this question be settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>How? Firmly, fixedly, finally.--So that it can go about its business confidently, and leave the politicians to wrangle and intrigue among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>But in what mode firmly, fixedly, and finally ? In that which shall satisfy the just demands of the people on whose tranquility their bread depends, so that these people, their customers, shall for the indefinite future be content, and thus ensure the <num value="1">one</num> thing needful to commerce &mdash; peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>And what will satisfy their section?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><num value="1">One</num> of <num value="3">three</num> things &mdash; a separate <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, a reconstruction, which shall include with <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> the slaveholding States only so many contagious free States as can be outvoted and controlled on sectional questions, or a re-union of the whole under a Constitution differing from the present <num value="1">one</num> in this: that it shall give each section the control of its own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>And what shall be done to produce this settlement?

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> Your letter inviting me to become a candidate for the <rs>Convention</rs>, to be held next month, has been read by me with feelings of great personal gratification.--The number of persons by whom it is subscribed is a pleasing evidence of the kind feelings which the people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> have for me. Besides the persons who are subscribers to your letter, a great many have solicited me to be a candidate for the <rs>Convention</rs>, and I cordially make my acknowledgments for such a manifestation of confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The position which you propose to assign me is <num value="1">one</num> of the gravest and most fearful responsibility; and as you think I may be of service in the deliberations of the <rs>State</rs>, you are welcome to use my name as a candidate for the <rs>Convention</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/> It is proper, however, that I should communicate to you my position, as I do not wish any <num value="1">one</num> to vote for me or against me under a false impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Letters and speeches are now-a-days so long and so numerous that they are not apt to be carefully read or considered; but, being a candidate for your suffrages, I deem it proper to give you some indication of my views. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is yet in the infancy of its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>In the lifetime of nations, it has lived scarcely a day. In growth and power it has no parallel in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>To our shores we have welcomed the sons of every clime, and in every clime our flag has been recognized as the representative of a great and powerful people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>At home we <hi rend="italics">have been</hi> united, prosperous and happy; <hi rend="italics">now</hi> we are divided, distressed and unhappy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Evil times betide us. The Government, which was formed by our forefathers, is threatened with destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>At the very prospect of this, you have already realized a sad experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>In the place of peace, we have the melancholy prospect of war. Many of you have no occupation, because the times will not authorize your employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Your resources are weakened, your credit is impaired, and the people generally, without regard to party or classes, really feel distressed and unhappy in the present condition of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/> We know that this is owing to the agitation of the question of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>This is an institution which we believe to be not only lawful in the sight of man, but <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Its existence has been a source of violent contention with the politicians of the country for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Its agitation has not only disturbed the harmony of the <name>Confederation</name> and the peace of the country, but has already in part broken up the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/> A mad and infatuated feeling on the part of the <rs>Northern</rs> people against an institution of which they know nothing, has caused them to deny the <rs>Southern</rs> people rights which are plainly guaranteed to them by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Crimination has begotten crimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>Abuse on <num value="1">one</num> side has been returned with abuse on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Excitement on all sides thus run high, and we all, therefore, find it difficult to consider with sufficient calmness the present troubles which surround and disturb us. Under such circumstances, we are all apt to do in a moment of impetuosity what we may never be able to undo; and therefore if we wish to act wisely, we ought to think well. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/> I have given to the present condition of affairs a great deal of consideration, and my opinion is, that the subject of slavery ought to be settled for once and forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>We know that we are entitled to its unmolested enjoyment, and I think we ought to demand its unmolested enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>If the <rs>North</rs> will give us this guarantee, so as to put the future agitation of slavery at rest, in plain and unmistakable terms, I think we ought to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>I think so, because I fear civil war; and if bloody revolution once begins in this country, its history, its woes, its gloom, and its desolation, will perhaps present to the world the <q>&#x0022;bloodiest picture in the book of time.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/> Whether we can have these guarantees, we do not yet positively know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Our Legislature has just delegated <num value="5">five</num> able Commissioners to go to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for the purpose of conferring with the representatives of other States, and of ascertaining what, if anything, can be done to save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>They will not assemble until the <date value="02-04">4th of February,</date> and we of course, therefore, cannot hear from them until after that time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/> If, after having exhausted these honorable means to save the country and its peace, we fail to do so, my opinion is that we should say to the <rs>Northern</rs> people, <q>&#x0022;You have refused to live with us on terms of equality, and we will not live with you upon any other terms; ours is therefore an unsuitable and an insufferable connection; we will part from you peaceably if we can, but forcibly if we must.&#x0022;</q> To the doctrine of coercion I am unalterably opposed, because no government which is sustained by force can be the government of a free, <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/> These are, briefly, my views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>They seem to me to be reasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>They may be modified to-morrow or next day, according to the events of the day, and if it be the pleasure of the people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to honor me with a seat in the <rs>Convention</rs>, I can only promise to do my best to maintain the honor, and to advance the interests of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/> I have deemed it proper to say this much to you because I desire you to know what views I entertain, and, further, because I have seen this morning that <num value="1">one</num> of the leading journals of the day, the <q>&#x0022;<orgName n="Richmond Enquirer" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi></orgName>,&#x0022;</q> has assailed my claims to the suffrages of the people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, upon the ground that I have <q>&#x0022;avowed coercion in its most odious form,&#x0022;</q> and for this relies upon an isolated sentence extracted from a dinner speech, made on a social occasion, at the hour of <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Now, on this occasion, I did not discuss or allude to the question of coercion, and it does so happen that the subject of coercion has never been an issue of discussion in any canvass in which I have been engaged.--Those, however, who have ever heard me speak upon the subject in private, know that it is a doctrine to which I have always been opposed, as I am now. Why it is that I am <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be assailed, I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Whether I will make for you a proper representative, I leave to my fellow-citizens of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> <closer> <salute>Very respectfully,</salute> <signed><persName n="Johnson,,Marmaduke,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00358" reg="default:Johnson,Marmaduke,,,"><foreName>Marmaduke</foreName>  <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <date value="1861-01-25">Jan. 25, 1861.</date> ja <num value="26">26</num>--1t* </closer> </div4> </div3>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/> --At the kind and earnest solicitation of many friends, who, in the last few days, have been urging me to consent to allow my name to be used as a candidate, from the county of <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName>, for the approaching <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, I hereby announce to my friends that, if they shall think proper to elect me, I will serve them in all fidelity, and with all the ability I possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>As the election is near at hand, and there may be no opportunity to express my opinions before a-public meeting of the citizens of the county, it may not be inappropriate to declare, in very brief words, the position which I hold in reference to the threatening aspect of public affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/> I believe, then, that the truest conservatism of the times is that which counsels a firm and decided course of action on the part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Let there be no indecision or hesitancy in action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/> I approve the action of the <name>Legislature</name> in pledging the <rs>State</rs> to resist coercion of any seceding State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/> I most heartily endorse the action of the <name>Legislature</name> in providing means for putting the <rs>State</rs> in an attitude of defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/> The effort which the <name>Legislature</name> has made, in sending Commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and inviting others from the other States of the <rs>Union</rs>, to endeavor to adjust the difficulties which now unfortunately distract the country, commends itself to my judgment as eminently proper, and no man will rejoice more than myself if their efforts shall succeed; but to allay the strife fully, and bring back peace to the country, it is clear to my mind that it must be such an adjustment as will satisfy the whole <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/> I am utterly opposed to any Central or Border States Confederacy, and believe that the fortunes of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> are indissolubly bound up in the fortunes of the whole <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/> Truly, we know not what a day may bring forth, and most of us have been constrained to modify our opinions by the recent rush of events, and it is therefore difficult to declare beforehand what will be best to do when our Convention meets, some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> hence; but, in general terms, I have no hesitancy in declaring that, if the efforts now being made for adjusting all our rights in the <rs>Union</rs> shall fall, then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I should latterly oppose any adjournment of the <rs>Convention</rs> before, by solemn act, she had resumed for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> all her sovereign rights, and placed herself side by side with her sister States of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/> In conclusion, I desire to say to my friends, that if these opinions, very briefly expressed, shall meet their approbation, my name is at their service; but, at the same time, I desire them distinctly to understand that my name must not embarrass them, and I hereby authorise them, at any moment, to withdraw it, when, in their opinions, it shall be necessary to the success of their opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>I believe in the right of a sovereign State to resist wrongs clearly unconstitutional, in or out of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and <hi rend="italics">a fortiori,</hi> in her right for such cause to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, and that the aggressions of the <rs>North</rs> upon the <rs>South</rs> are unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>It is argued that I wish to impose unnecessary burthens on the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, for her protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/> I am greatly honored by being proposed by many of you for the approaching Convention, and pray you to accept my grateful acknowledgments for thus distinguishing me. It is a place to which I would not unsolicited aspire, nor can I decline to serve therein, should it please our city to elect me. I know of no higher and more solemn trust than the <rs>Convention</rs> will be charged with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Our Constitution, Union, the peace of our country, and free institutions, in the end, may rise or fall with its acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>Its avowed purpose is to determine whether our Government, which has attested the wisdom of its founders by matchless benefits, and which, even now, is admitted to lack nothing, except the obedience and respect due to its just and impartial requirements, shall be abandoned for another, differing from it in no essential particular, save in being adjusted to a smaller area. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/> We have been wronged &mdash; greatly wronged.--Wicked attempts upon our rights and peace, instigated by sectional and fanatical conspiracy, and growing, as such things do, by the law of their corrupt nature, have brought the country to its convulsed condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Nothing should content the <rs>South</rs> but an explicit and comprehensive recognition of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Issue being joined with the <rs>North</rs>, any slight, inadequate, temporary adjustment would be submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>That is not to be thought of, nor will be. The equal rights of the <rs>South</rs> in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and the surrender of their fugitive slaves, are neither to be waived nor modified. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/> Our grievances proceed from the fanatics of the offending States, and the factious and corrupt public men, who abuse their stations to foment sectional alienations and hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Politicians by occupation are incapable of bringing the controversy to a peaceful termination, if <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has in reserve for us so signal a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>The people of the <rs>North</rs>--the plain, uncorrupt, industrious yeomanry &mdash; they who would be victims of a revolution, can alone avoid it. In their midst are multitudes of loyal and intrepid men, prepared to unite in measures for conciliation and adjustment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Let there be a Convention of the people of the <rs>Northern</rs> and Western States--let there be at least an effort to ascertain if they will meet, to redress and satisfy the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>Above all, let there be a Convention of all the border slave States, including <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, to settle the course of proceeding, and the guarantees demanded by the exigency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>They are united in sentiment and policy, in principle and impulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Our Legislature has wisely instituted a Commission, to inquire how far it is within the range of peaceful remedies to restore and perpetuate the <rs>Union</rs>, Let the issue of these pacific means be seen &mdash; let all honorable expedients to continue the <rs>Union</rs> be tried before it be given up and abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>It consists with her high position, and is the truest dignity and manliness for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> so to act. And if the <rs>North</rs> should prove intractable, the co-operation of the border States in their demand of Southern rights, in portioning the property, forces and muniments of the <rs>Government</rs>, would be a tower of strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> If force be employed against the <name>States</name> who have gone out of the <rs>Union</rs>, it should and must be resisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Force is not among the means of composing the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>It is not appropriate or adequate to any legitimate or desirable end. Should the <rs>Government</rs> perversely attempt it, the fable of shearing the wolf would fully illustrate the folly and wantonness of her counsels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The States should be brought back, if haply they may, by concessions alone; and these being yielded in the proper quarter, an appeal to them from the border States, wherein <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>His wayward mind was full of all the associations that were least congenial with the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>He declared that his poem of <q>&#x0022;The Dream&#x0022;</q> was a true picture of his wedding morning; and there are circumstances, not told in his <q>&#x0022;Life, &#x0022;</q> which render this probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>After the ceremony and breakfast, the young couple left Seaham for <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Ralph</foreName></persName>'s seat at Halnaby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Towards dusk of that winter day the carriage drove up to the door, where the old butler stood ready to receive his young lady and her bridegroom.
