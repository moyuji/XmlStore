<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> In assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious-common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the government needed at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value</hi> are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> The terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or price for a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> In illustration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient, or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &#x0026;c. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> Since the adoption of our schedules for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed <num value="33">thirty-three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to render any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Therefore, we assets the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules, impressed since the passage of the currency bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forthwith call on all of those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our average appraisement, <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure>, as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> and a minimum price of <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the inferior, as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issue of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> The impressing officers in those instances where those were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should in all such cases themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.
