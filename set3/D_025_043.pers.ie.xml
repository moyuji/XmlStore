<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Their cavalry is disposed along the front and on their flanks, watching and waiting, and glad enough, I have no doubt, to be permitted to rest and recruit after the tremendous exertions which they were compelled by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to make in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The small village of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> is rather deserted in appearance, and few topics of interest are on the <hi rend="italics">tapis.</hi> The last &#x0022;sensation news&#x0022; is the rumored supersede of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> by <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, and this report has excited much comment and deep feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I do not believe a word of it, but if such a thing were done I am convinced that it would produce a bad effect upon the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I have heard officers and men, colonels and privates, talk on the subject, and, except among a few, there is but <num value="1">one</num> sentiment. &#x0022;What!&#x0022; they all say, turn <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> adrift!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Put a man who has never commanded cavalry, except for a short time, and in small bodies, over <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, who has commanded nothing but cavalry, and with such glory from the start!&#x0022; The feeling of the cavalry in the matter is strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The fact is that <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> has associated his name for so long a time with the cavalry, and his men have such confidence in him as a leader, that few credit the report that any serious intention of putting <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> or anybody else over him can exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The idea of any other commander of the cavalry does not seem to &#x0022;take,&#x0022; except with a few characters, who, for private reasons, growl out about &#x0022;surprises at <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station</placeName>, &#x0022; &#x0026;c. <num value="1">One</num> thing these people have accomplished, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>I heard to-day from a scout who had just returned from over the river that <hi rend="italics">the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had heard the rumor and were rejoicing.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It is said they expressed great joy at it, and congratulated themselves upon the &#x0022;good time&#x0022; they were going to have, with <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> no longer near to worry and harass them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The fact is, this change in the command of the cavalry would prove, just at this time, most unfortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Never was the reputation of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> higher than at present, if I am to judge from the talk of his officers and men. They say that he is constantly receiving petitions from other commands, which are anxious to be with him, and applications for transfers from the infantry are made all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Add to this that he is known to enjoy the high, I might say the unlimited, confidence of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> to be wholly ignorant of this affair, and the singular nature of the report will be better understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I do not myself believe a word of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> If anything of interest occurs in this quarter I will send you some items.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> --<persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>, in his Proclamation, proposes to do that which we felt satisfied from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> would have to be done &mdash; viz: to retrace the step taken by the last Legislature, by which a very large part of the currency put afloat by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> was refused to be taken in the payment of the <rs>State</rs> taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The Governor exhibits his own good sense in declaring the interdiction of that currency to have been unwise, and to have resulted in public inconvenience and in still further depreciating the <rs>Government</rs> notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The act by which these notes were thus interdicted by our own State Government, was occasioned by the attempt of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to drive them from circulation; and the <rs>Virginia</rs> banks in this city endeavored to cooperate with both Governments, in refusing to receive them on deposit after the day on which the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> declared them no longer fundable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>, in his Proclamation, says very truly: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> &#x0022;While it is proper for the <rs>Government</rs> to call in its excessive issues, and to endeavor to fund its debt, it is not necessary or proper, in my judgment, in doing so, to discredit the only money that is now in the hands of the people to meet their every-day transactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The capitalist and broker may collect and fund the amount of the currency in their hands, but the <rs>Government</rs> should not permit the banks and the corporations of the country to discredit the money which the poor are required to receive, by refusing to receive it on deposit and rejecting it for ordinary dues, and much less should the <name>States</name> themselves discredit it by prohibiting its reception in payment of taxes and public duce.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Gov. Letcher"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> The Governor proceeds further to say that such acts are calculated to excite a panic, to the injury of the <rs>Government</rs>, and he convokes the <name>Legislature</name> &#x0022;especially to repeal the act prohibiting the reception of Confederate notes of a particular date, in payment of public dues. &#x0022; To this he adds very pertinently: &#x0022;Much rather would I punish those who refuse to receive the currency of the country with the utmost penalties of the law.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> We do not doubt for a moment that the <name>Legislature</name> will repeal this act. It ought never to have been passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/><placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> acted more wisely than <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>She determined to receive the rejected currency and very patriotically to invest it in Confederate bonds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> While we should be gratified to learn that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> secured the conversion of a very large amount of the <num value="0.08">8 per cent.</num> convertible notes into bonds, we are certainly not surprised that a large amount of those notes are still in circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>But, nevertheless, as <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> says, it was not proper to attempt to drive that currency out of circulation by discrediting it. Such an expedient not only subjected the public to inconvenience, but as an inevitable consequence, it impaired the value of the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency generally, in the public estimation &mdash; not only that which had been issued prior to <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct>, &#x0027;<num value="63">63</num>, but that which appeared after that date.--This opinion was expressed in this paper at the time the measure was adopted, and its correctness is pretty well established. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> The folly of issuing notes promising upon their faces that they would be redeemed in <num value="0.08">8 per cent</num>, bonds is confessed by the <rs>Government</rs> itself, as it has discontinued to issue them, and unwisely, as well as unjustly, we think, determined further not to fulfill the promise thus made.--Besides, the notice that a part of those notes would not be converted into bonds at all after the <dateStruct value="-08-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and another part only at <num value="0.04">4 per cent.</num>, was entirely insufficient to enable the holders to bring them in, however much inclined they might have been to do so. That currency was floating everywhere, to the utmost extremities of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Even could the new notes of the <date value="04-01">1st of April</date> and subsequently have been disseminated rapidly enough to supply a currency to take their place, they could not have been collected and delivered in due time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>So the holders were required to perform an impossibility, and for failing to perform it they were to be punished <hi rend="italics">by condemning the notes they held after <date value="08-01">August 1st</date> to depreciation!</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that the financial policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, as displayed in the promise of <num value="0.08">8 per cent.</num>, and in the effort to call in the notes, was suggested by the most proper motives, viz: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>A desire to give the <rs>Government</rs> currency good standing; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, a purpose to diminish the amount in circulation by forcing the holders to convert it into bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> expedient was fallacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It had no effect at all. People would have had the same faith in it had it made no promise whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was unpractical and visionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It was abrupt, harsh, and unpopular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It produced complaint and engendered opposition where none had existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It proceeded upon a wrong principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It assumed that a borrower had a right to dictate terms &mdash; to coerce the lender to take whatever form of obligation he choose to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>There is certainly no such moral right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>That this expedient was unfortunate in its effects there cannot, we suppose, be a doubt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> The currency issued by the <rs>Government</rs> is in excess of the wants of commerce, and of course must be depreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>It ought to be diminished in quantity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> modes of doing this: <num value="1">One</num> by taxation &mdash; the other by conversion of notes into bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The Government was slow in its measures for taxation &mdash; and taxation is the only sure way of raising the public credit; because it is the only way of paying the public debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>It ought to be resorted to freely and heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The people are ready and willing to meet the weight of it. No people were ever, in a better condition to pay taxes, because the means of payment is so abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The conversion into bonds ought to be by sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The forcing system won't do. Governments can no more get rid of their promises to pay for more than they are worth than men can. They must submit to the same rules that govern personal credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> Issue no more notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Combine a bold system of taxation with the sale of bonds under shrewd financial direction; and the public credit will rise &mdash; the currency be appreciated &mdash; and prices, generally fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The people are devoted to the cause, and the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>They nevertheless complain of its errors in finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>They think it might he greatly improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>They know that no Government on earth has resources equal to those of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> after the war; and are satisfied with prudent management, so as to keep the public debt within some reasonable limits during the war, all the public obligations will be honorably met and the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> be <unclear></unclear> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
