<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The Union demonstration in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, was a very grand affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Nearly all the business houses on the chief streets were closed, and the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> also suspended business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The navy-yard was also closed and the hands attended the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The <rs>Bulletin</rs> of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> In the early morning it was evident to the pedestrian upon <address><street n="Chestnut street">Chestnut street</street></address> that something of more than ordinary interest was anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>With the dawn the great banner was unfurled from the <rs type="place">State House</rs> mast, and dozens of citizens and strangers paused beneath the long shadow of the steeple to watch the colors and folds fluttering in the breeze &mdash; There were some palatial stores that were not opened at all, and the movements of certain clerks in others that were unclosed indicated an early suspension of labor and relaxation at noonday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>From the prevalence of cordage and flag staffs over and above the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was plausible that more bunting was to burns out. On the summit of buildings amateur riggers were noticed, in the act of splicing cords, and, as if the town was under martial law, all at once the national ensign streamed over the crowds below and under the sky above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Few could doubt, that saw them waving and swelling, that in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> at least, every feeling of the people, in labor, at trade and in merchandize, was enlisted for the welfare of the whole country and the perpetuity of its undivided dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Such was <address><street n="Chestnut street">Chestnut street</street></address> at dawn: when the clock in the <rs type="place">State House</rs> tower pointed toward the hours of <num value="10">ten</num> and <num value="11">eleven</num>, the scenes were more marked and distinctive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>New banners were unfurled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The hotels were draped in beautiful colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The railway cars maintained the character of the day. The nodding heads of the horses were covered with miniature ensigns; from the peaks of the cars a silken flag was streaming, and the gaily painted vehicles thus attired, resembled rather triumphal cars than carriages for popular conveyance. </p> </q><bibl n="The Bulletin"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Toward mid-day the pavements of <address><street n="Chesnut street">Chesnut street</street></address> were thronged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Sturdy mechanics, coming from the manufactories of the upper and lower city, filed into the beautiful avenue, and the stores upon the wharves discharged their numerous operatives, who hastened at once toward the all-absorbing square <address><street n="Market street">Market street</street></address> was half depopulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>All men were in <address><street n="Chestnut street">Chestnut street</street></address>, surging and pressing toward the old fame of independence, with minds single upon <num value="1">one</num> day at least to forget party issues, and remember the entire Union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> At <time value="12pm">noon</time> precisely, the <rs>Committee</rs> of Councils, the selected speakers, the <rs>Mayor</rs> and aids descended from <placeName reg="Council Chambers">Council Chambers</placeName>, amid profound silence, and were received by the <orgName n="Reserve Corps" type="corps">reserve corps</orgName> with a cap salute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They filed between <num value="2">two</num> rows of broad shouldered officers, passed over the doorway, where tradition has it that the <name>Declaration</name> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> announced, and took places on the stand, in presence of a vast assembly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They were received with prolonged clapping of hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>On the instant large numbers of copies of resolutions were distributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They were grasped by a <num value="100">hundred</num> hands, and folded as mementoes of the day.--The crowd was tremendous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Not less than <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> people were assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The outer crowd could not distinguish a word of what was spoken from the stand, yet every individual conducted himself as if the issue of the demonstration depended upon his own good conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Such was the square &mdash; a living mass of people, each blade of grass a man &mdash; where the pacific exercises of a great demonstration commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> had assembled to do the <rs>Union</rs> reverence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <persName n="Potter,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Potter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Potter</surname></persName> opened the ceremonies with prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName n="Henry,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Henry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Henry</surname></persName>, who presided, then made the following address: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Citizens of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>:--You have been called together upon this momentous occasion by-request of your municipal Councils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>You have been invited to assemble in this hallowed place that, divesting yourselves of every partizan emotion, discarding all sordid and self-interested views, you may intelligently consider the present unhappy condition of your country and the danger which threatens your national union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>And what is that condition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But a short time has elapsed since <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> freemen rejoiced with proper pride in the widespread prosperity and full security afforded to them by the best perfected government that man has ever devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>To-day those <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> are wrapped in gloom &mdash; are paralyzed by the forebodings of evil, which no experience can depict, or agitated with projects which no forecast can resolve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><measure n="84years" type="date">Eighty-four years</measure> ago the jubilant shouts of new made freemen hailed the declaration of their independence as it was proclaimed from this very spot; and now <num value="1000">thousands</num> who have been born and reared under the rich blessings of constitutional liberty, are gathered together on the same ground in the sad stillness of coming despair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> And what is the danger that hangs over your <orgName n="National Union" type="newspaper">National Union</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>A form of government projected by the liberal sentiments of patriots, framed by the consummate skill of statesmen, which, for nearly <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure>, has attracted the admiring wonder of the world, which has fostered the growth of this people from <num value="13">thirteen</num> feeble colonies to <num value="33">thirty-three</num> sovereign States, has ceased to retain the confidence of a portion of its confederacy, and today is convulsed with the premonitory throes of speedy dissolution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The giant intellects that in former days have expounded and illuminated its admirable Constitution, that in times of peril have guided this nation safety through the embittered contests of opinion, have gone from us, and there live none to fill their places. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> In this crisis, the only remedy for existing evils must be sought for in the sovereignty of the people, in the responsive patriotism of the masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Approved only by their firm resolve and prompt effort, can this Union be perpetuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>[Applause] Hence it is that you, the people of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> are now called upon to avow your unbroken attachment to the <rs>Union</rs>, and your steadfast determination that no honest effort shall be left untried to preserve its integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> My fellow-citizens, I should be false to the position in which you have placed me; I should be recreant to my sense of duty, if I withheld an avowal of the truth which this occasion demands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> If in any portion of our Confederacy sentiments have been entertained and cherished which are inimical to civil rights and social institutions of any other portion, those sentiments should be relinquished and discountenanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The family discipline which you choose to adopt for your own fireside, whilst it does not violate the law under which you dwell, is your rightful prerogative, and you are prompt to resent the officious intermeddling of others, however well intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The social institutions of each State in this Union are equally the rightful prerogatives of its citizens, and so long as those institutions do not contravene the principles of your Federal compact, none may justly interfere with or righteously denounce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The efficient cause of the distracted condition of our country is to be found in the prevalent belief of the citizens of the <rs>South</rs> that their brethren of the <rs>North</rs> are, as a community, arrayed against a social institution to which they look as essential to their prosperity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> You are ready to aver truthfully that such belief is mistaken and unfounded; but it becomes all who are actuated by an earnest brotherhood, to see to it that where public sentiment has been misled, it shall be restored to its stand-point of <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> The misplaced teachings of the pulpit, the unwise rhapsodies of the lecture room, the exciting appeals of the press on the subject of slavery, must be frowned down by a just and law-abiding people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Thus and thus only may you hope to avoid the sectional discord, agitation and animosity which, at frequently recurring periods, have shaken your political fabric to its centre, and at last have undermined its very foundation, and these glorious proportions which, under more kindly influence, might have proven enduring as time, seem now to be rapidly crumbling and tottering to their fall I adjure you, citizens of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, by the proud memory of the past; by the rich privileges of the present; by the fond hopes of the future; I call upon you by the tender endearments of your homes, by the holy influence of your altars, to send forth a voice that shall be heard throughout the length and breadth of this land, proclaiming your immutable devotion to the union of these States--your firm resolve that, by the favor of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, this Union must and shall be maintained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The speaker then retired, amid loud applause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> <num value="3">Three</num> cheers were proposed for <persName n="Henry,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Henry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Henry</surname></persName>, and given with a will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The following resolutions were then read, and adopted by acclamation: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The following are the resolutions adopted: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> The people of the city of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> having assembled in cheerful obedience to the proclamation of the <rs>Mayor</rs> issued by request of their Councils for the purpose of testifying their love for the <rs>Union</rs> and their devotion to its perpetuation, and to the strengthening of those houses which hold us together whether of the <rs>North</rs> of the south, the <rs>East</rs> or the <rs>West</rs>, as <num value="1">one</num> great and united people, do. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi> <num value="3">3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>That we do therefore most deeply deplore the fact that some of the <name>States</name> of this Union have placed upon their statute books enactments which evade or defeat provisions which the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> wisely inserted for the protection of valuable rights of citizens of other States; and that we pronounce all such acts to be violations of the solemn compact by which we are made <num value="1">one</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>and that we earnestly appear to our brethren of those States instantly to repeal all such enactments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>That the people of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> hereby pledge themselves to their brethren of the other States that the statute books of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> shall be carefully searched by their representatives at the approaching session of the <name>Legislature</name>, and that every statute, if any such there be, which in the least degree invades the constitutional rights of citizens of a sister State will be at once repeated, and that <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, ever loyal to the <rs>Union</rs> and liberal in construing her obligations to it, will be faithful always in her obedience to its requirements. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> The great error consists in the belief that a feeling of animosity is universal, or at least general, in each extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Let us cherish a contrary trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The most noisy are not the most numerous or full of influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>During the late canvass many excellent citizens were deeply affected by bad examples about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>But the surface was only materially ruffled.--In deeper water good sense lay buried, and probably prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Passion was contagious, and resistance slow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In the <rs>South</rs> we have witnessed a striking proof of kindness and devotion to the good cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Almost at the centre of initiate secession a voice has been uttered of harmony, and heard with the deepest gratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>His views have been reflected brightly here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>A letter, full of grateful thanks, has been numerously signed and forwarded to him. It will prove the contagion of kindness to be at least as warm as that of hatred, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times more welcome, generous and amiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>A letter, too, has been received from the heart of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, thanking an estimable friend of ours personally unknown to the writer, as the mover of certain Union resolutions at a recent meeting of Democratic citizens at <placeName reg="Germantown, Philadelphia, Philadelphia" key="tgn,7014057">Germantown</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> Let out reply be made more marked than words, in an immediate repeal of our hostile fugitive slave law. Let this be a free-will offering from our central Common wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Let that unfriendly act be offered up a victim on the altar of our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> In all these late contentions, it is feared that the people have forgotten the sage and virtuous counsels of the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country.--His memory is embalmed in universal love &mdash; The whole world considers it foremost in every shining attribute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>His posterity, after <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> have passed over his mortal remains, unites with <num value="1">one</num> accord in veneration for his saint-like character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Let his wise instruction &mdash; his parting and parental benediction &mdash; be made the universal passport of social and political intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Above all, let us remember his anxious wish that our Union may be as lasting as time, and that brotherly affection may be perpetual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>On the coming birthday, the <date value="02-22">22d of February,</date> let its language adorn every flag, and fill a column of every newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Our Southern friends think themselves aggrieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Perhaps they have just cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>We are free from blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Words of conciliation may not be unwelcome from this quarter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> However they may suppose to the contrary, our affections are not alienated from our Southern friends, and even now the rumor of any damage to them from a domestic source, would bring to their aid a legion of the young men of our State; aye, and of those more advanced in life, ready to assist them in the emergency and willing to shed their blood in their defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>I appeal to you, citizens of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, whether I am not speaking the truth? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> What, then, can we say to them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>What more than we have expressed in the resolutions we have offered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>If they are really aggrieved by any laws upon our statute book opposed to their rights &mdash; if, upon examination, any such are found to be in conflict with the <rs>Constitution</rs> of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; hay, further, if they but serve to irritate our brethren of the <rs>South</rs>, whether constitutional or not, I, for <num value="1">one</num>, have no objection that they should be instantly repealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>They are not necessary to our existence as a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We have lived without them in years that are past, and we cannot, however, concede that in this respect our noble Commonwealth has done any intentional wrong, but if in our calm judgment it shall appear that our feelings in the slightest degree warped, have apparently inflicted any injury, she is noble and generous enough manfully to repair it. Let the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law be executed in its full interest and spirit.--It is the law of the land, let it be implicitly obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>We might perhaps desire to have a few of its provisions modified, but let it remain as it is, however liable these portions may be to Southern criticism, if the <rs>South</rs> deem it necessary for the protection of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Let us, too, submit as we have hitherto cheerfully done to the decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>It is the great bulwark of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Its judgments should be final and conclusive and not be questioned in any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Whilst the free discussion of every question is the privilege of every citizen of the <rs>Republic</rs>, let us discountenance any denunciation of slavery, or those who maintain that institution, as intemperate and wrong, whether they are promulgated in the lecture room, at the political gathering, or from the sacred desk. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The work now in progress consists in cleaning the sand from the walls of the fort; ditching it around the entire circumference, and erecting a glacis; closing up the postern gates in the <name>east</name> and <name>west</name> walls, and instead cutting sally-ports, which lead into strong out- works on the south<name>east</name> and <name>south</name>west angles, in which <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounder howitzer guns will be placed, enabling the garrison to sweep the ditch on <num value="3">three</num> sides with grape and canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> We are thoroughly convinced that never for the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> has there been such an opportunity of placing the <rs>Union</rs> of these States on a firm and immovable foundation as is now presented, if the <rs>South</rs> will be but true to herself, and, in being true to herself, true to the <rs>North</rs>, and true to the country.--&#x0022;To thine own self be true &mdash; thou canst not then be false to any man,&#x0022; says the great dramatist, and never, outside of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, were wiser words ever uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>If the <rs>Southern States</rs> will now meet in convention, and place before the <rs>North</rs>, as invited by recent resolutions in a Northern city, what they require as essential to the preservation of the present Government, we solemnly believe it will be yielded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We predict that every pledge will be made and every guarantee given which mutual justice and harmony demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>And this will be done, not from the want of either physical or moral courage, for the man who imputes any inferiority in either to the <rs>North</rs> is a hopeless idiot, but because the interests involved are too immense to be sacrificed for the sake of an empty abstraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>We mean no derogation to the <rs>North</rs> in saying that they are governed by their interests where no principles demand the surrender of their interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Every people are thus governed, and most individuals, and none as much so as those who make the loudest pretensions to generosity and self-sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The <rs>North</rs> cannot afford to give up the <rs>Union</rs>, and if the <rs>South</rs> convinces it that either the slavery agitation must be eternally ended, or the <rs>Union</rs> is gone, depend upon it, the practical, money-making North will seize the anti-slavery fanaticism by the throat, and choke it to death without an hour's delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>But in order to do that, it must be convinced that the <rs>South</rs> is in earnest, which it never has been fully yet, and never will be till we give up party and local dissensions, and, with a solid front, demand that the national compact shall be observed, both in letter and spirit, (for the letter without the spirit is dead,) or else that, having ceased to be binding upon the <rs>North</rs>, it shall no longer be binding upon the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> The prompt and thorough settlement of this subject is a question in which every man has a vital interest; the non-slaveholder as much as the slaveholder; the poor as much as the rich; the <rs>Northern</rs> citizen as much as the <rs>Southern</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Whatever other abstractions may be connected with slavery, there is <num value="1">one</num> abstraction which is real, which the industrious and hard-working men of the country are now suffering &mdash; an abstraction of the means of life; of the rewards of industry; of food and clothing for their wives and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>People talk about the horrors of war. In Heaven's name, do you not take away a man's life when you take away the means whereby he lives?--What is there in half-a-dozen battles, compared to the agonies which tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men in this country now suffer who go to bed at night not knowing where they shall procure the next morning's food for their families, and who spend the day in prowling about the streets in search of labor &mdash; any kind of honest labor &mdash; to keep the wolf of starvation out of their doors and save themselves and these who are dearer to them than life from the woes and curses of hopeless poverty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>What an awful spectacle, these famished multitudes, with the pangs of hunger gnawing their bodies and the vulture of despair devouring their hearts!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Death on the battle field is Paradise compared to such purgatorial pains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Yet this is the condition of immense numbers, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>; of men who have had no influence in bringing about the present state of things; of the innocent dupes and victims of those miscreant politicians and demagogues, who, to secure their own personal or party purposes, are ready to involve their fellowmen in any kind or amount of misery.--And this is a condition which occurs not at remote intervals, but over and over again, and which may happen a year hence, and happen every year, until men have no more security, confidence or peace, than people who live on the borders of Vesuvins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>We believe that the time has come when the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> People will insist that the great object of all Government the security of life, property, order, must be had at all hazards; if not by peace, then by war; if not in the <rs>Union</rs>, then out of it; if not under a Republic, then under a King;--<hi rend="smallcaps">Stability, Peace, Property</hi>--these must be Ensured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>These we may have, in our poor judgment, under our present confederated Government, not, however, by the application of temporary emollients, but by a bold, thorough and compact demonstration of the whole <rs>South</rs>, demanding that now and forever the slavery question shall be put beyond the reach of further agitation, and placed in such a position that neither the fanatics nor demagogues of either section shall be able again to make it a hobby for their absurd and selfish schemes.--Let the <rs>Southern States</rs>, then, meet in Convention, and lay broad and deep the foundations of a real and enduring Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>We feel convinced that the <name>Conservatism</name> and Patriotism of the <rs>North</rs> will meet the <rs>South</rs> half-way; that the <name>Property</name> of the <rs>North</rs> will join hands with the <name>Property</name> of the <rs>South</rs>; aye, that the <name>Labor</name> of the <rs>North</rs> will rise in its power and demand that its own rights, which are involved in the quieting of this eternal turmoil, shall be respected, and find, in guarantees to the <rs>South</rs>, the best and surest guarantees of its own interests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> If, however, in all this we are mistaken; if the just and reasonable demands of the <rs>Southern States</rs> shall be refused, then we shall have at least the advantage of disclosing to a certainty the opinions and purposes of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, and of governing our own course accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>If we cannot live together in peace and justice; if we are to go on forever chafing and fretting like unequally yoked oxen, we would better separate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>We do not believe that separation is necessary; we are sure that a powerful minority in the <rs>North</rs> is ready to back up the <rs>South</rs> in peace or war, if it will only banish discord from its own ranks and define its position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>But, as we have before said, better dissolution, better war, than a perpetuation of the present state of chronic discontent, uncertainty, and of enormous suffering among the great masses of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Out of the chaos some new system may arise, and if it does, let us devoutly hope that, warned by the lessons of the past, it will avoid alike the concentration of great power in Executive hands, and the universal voting of everybody for everything, which has proved <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest curses of the <rs>Republic</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>As if to crown his happiness, a little girl was now born, and the consequent seclusion of the young mother gave the <rs>President</rs> reason to hope that for the future all was well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>A certain regimen had been prescribed for the invalid, of which a strong broth, to be taken at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, formed a portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Suddenly Angelique, once more becoming a domestic wife, insisted on preparing this broth herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Servin had his own views on the subject, and resolved to oppose stratagem by stratagem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> of Angelique's acting as cook, the valet took a pet dog of the <rs>President</rs>'s, a pretty white spaniel, and shut it into his own chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>Taking care to be in the way at the right moment, he took the broth from her hands to carry to his master; but on his way to the sick room visited his own, and pouring at least half the contents of the bowl on a plate, set it before the dog, and again shut him up. When he reached his master's room he found Angelique there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/> &#x0022;Where have you delayed?&#x0022; she asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> &#x0022;I spilt some of the soup, <rs type="role2">Madame</rs>, and could not appear before my master till I had changed my coat, which was splashed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/> &#x0022;Ah!&#x0022; The cry was from Angelique, and was caused by Servin, whose foot slipped on the waxed and slippery margin beyond the carpet, so that he fell and broke the bowl.--Angelique was enraged, but her anger only convinced the old man that he was right in his suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Yet to his astonishment the dog did not suffer, but continued perfectly well, although he had eaten the whole portion allotted to him. The valet was therefore obliged to conclude that no poison had yet been mixed in the soup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Angelique continued to prepare it, and Servin persevered in always taking out a portion for the dog before he gave it to his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>It was excellent, and both the dog and his master appeared the better for it. So things went on for about <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, and then Servin, on taking the bowl from his mistress <num value="1">one</num> day, fancied that he discovered a certain nervous agitation in her manner; in his hearing, too, she ordered her footman to accompany der directly, on a visit to <persName n="Remonet,Madame,,,,de" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00385" reg="mostcommon:Remonet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Remonet</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Servin hastened to feed the dog, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> made sure that his mistress was gone out. He was in the act of pouring out the broth when an angry exclamation startled him, and he saw his master standing by. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> &#x0022;Do you dare to give my luncheon to the dog!&#x0022; he said; and made Servin precede him to his chamber, where he seated himself before the tray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>As he raised the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> spoonful to his lips the faithful valet arrested his hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> &#x0022;Do not taste it, my dear master,&#x0022; he said; &#x0022;it is <hi rend="italics">poisoned.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/> &#x0022;What do you say?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> &#x0022;Your soup is poisoned.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> Servin brought in the dog and gave him all the broth Not a word was spoken either by master or servant for more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour, during which the dog heavy with a full meal, had gone to sleep before the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>At last it seemed disturbed, rose, whined, rolled itself on the floor writhing in convulsions, and was violently sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>In <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> more the dog was dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> There was no doubt of Angelique's intention, but the old <rs>President</rs> implored Servin with tears not to betray her to justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>The man solemnly promised, on condition that his master neither ate nor drank anything but what he himself prepared and bought.--It was resolved between them to conceal their knowledge of the attempt as much as possible, and to allow Angelique to believe that the broth had been taken by her husband, who would feign illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>He therefore retired to bed, and was scarcely there when Angelique entered. </p>
