<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The position at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> now commands the almost undivided attention of both the nations engaged in this war. Affairs elsewhere hardly occupy a thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The prompt removal of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, hitherto a successful commander, for his defeat, shows what importance the <rs>Federals</rs> attach to the situation there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName> (of the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num>) writes a highly interesting letter, which we copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It gives a very gloomy view of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> position: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> I have already demonstrated in former letters that while <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> is a strategically important point, it is not a safe <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>To hold it securely involves the necessity of holding the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> for <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> to the right and left of it.--As soon as our army had crossed at <placeName reg="Bellefonte, Centre, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013373">Bellefonte</placeName>, <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, it was virtually master of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>For the same reason, when it was forced back into it, after the battles of the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="20">20th ult.</day></dateStruct>, the question to hold it rested upon its ability not so much to repel an attack from the front as to retain control of the river below.--There was not force enough at the command of <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> to protect all the fords and roads leading from the south bank to his depots and lines of communication on and along the river.--Hence his principal danger was the contingency of a flank movement by a detached column of the enemy over the same route that he took to leave <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>With the arrival of reinforcements that danger passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The failure of the enemy to make the movement affords good evidence not only that their offensive strength was greatly weakened in the battles, but also that it really never was as far superior as reported. </p> </q><bibl n="The Chattanooga correspondent of the New York Tribune"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The most direct danger, in view of the temporary state of partial dissolution of the army, was, of course, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a front attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The few days' delay of the enemy in closing up with us around the town gave us time to avert it with the axe, pick, and shovel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But although we checked an assault by infantry, we were powerless to remove the danger threatening from their artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>That with <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> and <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> in their possession they can use the latter effectively against us, they have amply proved by their cannonade on the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">5th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I use the word &#x0022;effectively,&#x0022; although they did little actual damage at the time; for their projectiles fell into our camps all along our line, and it must be the veriest tyro in war that will assert that by tripling their guns, which they have it, doubtless, in their power to, could not, by a cannonade of a week, annoy and damage us beyond endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It would be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance in the history of wars of a large army of unsheltered troops maintaining its position under a protracted and <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>That the enemy have as yet abstained from subjecting us to a severer trial than on the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> is a mystery that I am not able to solve. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> But supposing even that it is not awaiting us, there are still other ways left open to the enemy to draw us out of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>From <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> the distance is <measure n="110miles" type="distance">110 miles</measure>. That this long line cannot be successfully guarded against an attempt to cross the <rs>Tennessee</rs> in force, either by <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> or <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, is evident.--A flanking movement to our right is, as already stated, no longer practicable for the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But there was nothing to prevent <num value="1">one</num> to our left in the mentioned direction until to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Since midnight the very gates of heaven seem to be opened, and the rain is pouring down in incessant torrents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If the roads be not rendered impracticable by it, we will in all probability see the <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> pontoons the enemy have built at <placeName reg="Chickamauga Station, Chattanooga, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098422">Chickamauga Station</placeName> put to use before long, somewhere between here and <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It would certainly be the best move they could make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It would give their army once more the benefit of the crops of the rich <placeName reg="Tennessee Valley, Cherry, Nebraska" key="tgn,2715032">valley of the Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It would throw it between <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s, and compel the latter to beat a hasty retreat to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> to escape annihilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>And lastly, it would force this army to abandon <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> and hunt up the enemy for battle north of the <rs>Tennessee</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> A last element of uncertainty as to the duration of our occupation of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> is formed by our precarious lines of communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We have had <num value="3">three</num> bridges across the <rs>Tennessee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><num value="2">Two</num> of these were rendered impracticable by the rise a week ago, and <num value="1">one</num> had to be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The other was again used until this morning, when the danger of its being carried away by the great rise now to be expected, induced <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> to order likewise its removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> was built during last week, and affords now the only means of communication with the <rs>North</rs> bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>That it is insufficient for our immense transportation I need hardly say. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Again, the roads to <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama">Stevenson</placeName>, our supply depot, are so rugged that hauling a sufficiency of supplies over them is attended with difficulties the character of which only those can conceive who have passed over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The present rain will probably double these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><num value="1">One</num> of the roads along the river is rendered unsafe by the bushwhackers firing from the <rs>South</rs> bank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> It was natural for the enemy to attempt to cut the long thread of railroads &mdash; over <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure>--that alone connects us with the <rs>North</rs>, by dint of cavalry raids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It is to be hoped that our cavalry will prevent the mischief contemplated by the bands of <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> and <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, now again loose in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>If they should succeed in breaking our railroad connections for any considerable length of time, a retrograde movement by our forces cannot be avoided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Whatever the future may have in store for us it is obvious that the rebels are masters of the situation &mdash; at least so far as the power to shape it is with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>That they have improved the time of quietude elapsed since the battles to repair damages and gather additional offensive force may be presumed, as the fortunes of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> depend in a great measure upon further successes on their part; and as they have concentrated all their available strength before us, it is not likely that they will lie idle much longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Without having any positive ground for the theory, I think that if they fall in starving us out of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, they will make the flank movement to the left under cover of a cannonade upon our front. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> As to ourselves, prudence forbids me from saying more than we are not yet in the condition to resume the offensive, although we are able to operate promptly according to the initiative of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>For my part I would deem it cause for congratulation if the enemy should give us an opportunity to meet them in a decisive battle a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> nearer the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>. </p> </div4> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> The true explanation of the affair I take to be this: When my brigade arrived at <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName> we found there a party of North <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, commanded by a Lieutenant, who informed me that he was ordered to the vicinity of <placeName reg="Salisbury, Rowan, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076487">Salisbury</placeName>, I think, to arrest some deserters, and urged me to let his party go along with my brigade, for the sake of dispatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>I said yes, if he could find room in the train for his party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>He replied that he could take the tops of the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I told him then that he might do so. Accordingly, he and his party took the tops of the cars, and went with my brigade through <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>After we left <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName>, this party freely avowed themselves the authors of the deed, and claimed credit for it. They said they led some of my men into it with them, and I have no doubt they did, but I think not many, and these merely unorganized individuals, each acting for and by himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>These things I learned from officers and men who heard the talk of the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> on the train after it left <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName> <hi rend="italics">Mercantile Gazette</hi> its representative organ, has a long argument in opposition to the threatened action of the <rs>Ministry After</rs> quoting that passage in which the <rs>Earl</rs> says Parliament will be called on to pass &#x0022;further measures,&#x0022; the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi> says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that this passage points directly the iron-clads in course of construction at <placeName key="tgn,7012043" n="1.000 2" reg="birkenhead,wirral,england,united kingdom,europe">Birkenhead</placeName>, and that in the event of the existing law proving insufficient to prevent <persName n="Laird,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Laird,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Laird</surname></persName> proceeding with the work he has on hand, Government are prepared to come down to Parliament, either for indemnity for the contemplated interference with the Iron-clads, or for special act of Parliament to prohibit their construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>If this course be taken by the <rs>Government</rs> it will involve a violation of the neutrality of this country of so direct a character that we cannot suppose it can possibly meet with the sanction of the <name>Legislature</name>: </p> </q><bibl n="The Gazette"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> We have from time to time, and with considerable minuteness, endeavored to explain the principles of the existing law as applicable to the construction and supply of these iron- clads; and we think we have succeeded in showing that <persName n="Laird,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Laird,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Laird</surname></persName>, so far, has infringed no law, municipal or international, in executing the orders he has received for the vessels in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Nor have the <rs>Government</rs> gone the length of interdicting their construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>They have only, it is understood, intimated that the iron-clads will not be permitted to leave the <rs>Mersey</rs> until proof of their destination is furnished which will satisfy the <rs>Government</rs>, and it is stated that the <name>Liverpool</name>, <num value="1">one</num> of the ships of the <orgName n="Channel Squadron" type="squadron">channel squadron</orgName>, has been stationed in the <rs>Mersey</rs> to see that this intimation is respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>We can foresee that the course adopted by the <rs>Government</rs> in this matter is likely to lead to embarrassing consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The order for these vessels has come, it is said, from a French house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>A portion of the purchase money may, for anything we know to the contrary, have been already received by the builders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>When the vessels are completed the purchasers will have a right to demand that they shall be delivered to their order at some port, probably, in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> On what legal ground can <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government undertake to prohibit this delivery? --If the iron-clads leave the <rs>Mersey</rs> for a neutral port, and are delivered there, their subsequent destination cannot compromise the neutrality which they say it is their earnest desire and constant effort to maintain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>If from a French port these vessels sail to a Confederate port, or are taken into the service of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, it becomes a matter clearly for the consideration of the <rs>French Government</rs>, who are probably aware that there are at the present moment, in some of the <rs>French</rs> building yards, iron-clads in course of construction whose destination is much better understood than that of the steam rams in the <rs>Mersey</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> But if the <rs>British Government</rs>, in addition to the interdict upon the departure of these vessels, proceeds to ask the assent of Parliament to the &#x0022;further measures&#x0022; hinted at by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, they render themselves liable at once to the charge of compromising their neutrality in favor of the <rs>Federals</rs>; for by preventing the <rs>Confederates</rs> from obtaining in our ports assistance of which they stand in need, in the shape of ships, while they permitted the unimpeded exportation of everything which the <rs>Federals</rs> require, they confer an advantage upon the latter which they deny the former, and thereby unquestionably afford the <rs>Confederates</rs> a just ground of complaint. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> Vattel defines strict neutrality between belligerents to consist of <num value="2">two</num> obligations: <num value="1">1</num>. &#x0022;To give no assistance where there is no previous stipulation to give it, nor voluntarily to furnish troops, arms, ammunition, or anything of direct use of war.&#x0022; <num value="2">2</num>. &#x0022;Whatever does not relate to the war the neutral must not refuse to <num value="1">one</num> of the parties, merely because he is at war with the other, what he grants others.&#x0022; The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these obligations has been disregarded openly ever since the commencement of this <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> struggle; nor, indeed, can it be said to have strictly governed the conduct of any neutral States in any recent war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> But there is, nevertheless, an obvious and a paramount duty imposed upon all neutrals, and this duty consists in the observance of a strictly evenhanded conduct between the contending parties, so that neither can complain that an advantage is given to his antagonist which he is unable to obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>If this principle really governed the acts and policy of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government, they would be compelled to adopt <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> alternatives &mdash; either to interdict all trade with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> belligerents during the continuance of the war, or permit that trade, of whatever it may consist, to be pursued without question or interruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Our Government do neither. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> They do not prohibit &mdash; which the law enables them to do &mdash; the export of &#x0022;arms, ammunition, gunpowder, naval and military stores,&#x0022; and other articles required for an armed struggle, but they forbid the subjects of the crown to furnish steam rams, because &#x0022;such vessels might be used for purposes of war without ever touching the shores of the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports.&#x0022; If this be the adoption of a strick neutrality it is difficult to understand the meaning of the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>But this is not the only inconsistency which marks the policy of the <rs>Government</rs> in regard to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> belligerents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> was loudly applauded by his audience at <placeName key="tgn,1050450" n="1.000 10" reg="Blairgowrie,Perth and Kinross,Scotland,United Kingdom,Europe">Blairgowrie</placeName>, when he said he &#x0022;would not yield <num value="1">one</num> jot of <name>British</name> law or <name>British</name> right in consequence of the menace of any foreign power.&#x0022;--The sentiment is <num value="1">one</num> which will always elicit a cheer in any assembly of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>; but it came somewhat singular, after his lordship's announcement that ministers might find it necessary to ask the sanction of Parliament &#x0022;to further measures&#x0022; for the preservation of our neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>What these measures may be we know not, but they must involve some change in the municipal law of this country, which law <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, notwithstanding his brave words, is ready to amend at the instance of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> It is no secret that the steps taken respecting the <rs>Alexandria</rs> and the iron-clads have all originated on the pressure put upon the <rs>Government</rs> by <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> and those he represents at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.--But whatever may be the effect upon <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> and his colleagues of that pressure we cannot believe that it will have much influence on the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName> or lead to any change in the existing law. A very few years have elapsed since an Administration which attempted to induce the <name>Legislature</name> to amend our laws in obedience to a foreign menace, fell ignominiously, and the attempt, if repeated, will, we need not doubt, be attended with a similar result. </p> </div3>

<head>The condition of the city.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> Much has been said of late about extortioners, and men who hoard provisions in order to sell them at exorbitant prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>A contemporary journal having patronized a favorite measure for putting an end, as it conceived, to extortion, said, after it had been overwhelmingly defeated, that it hoped no more would be said against extortioners, thereby arrogantly assuming that it, and the very small party that supported it, had discovered the only true remedy for the disease of extortion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>In the same paper a few days after a man calling himself a soldier threatened a military mob in terms so plain that it was impossible to misunderstand his drift, if the families of the soldiers were not provided for, with a logic truly military, assuming that if the law in question had been passed they would have been provided for, <hi rend="italics">ipso facto.</hi> Now, we have been at great pains to discover whether there are really any persons in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> who are hoarding flour and other articles of prime necessity &mdash; such as bacon, beef, and meats generally &mdash; and we have been unable to discover <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We have, moreover, been assured by persons who have every right to know, that with respect to the article of flour not a <hi rend="italics">barrel</hi> has been hoarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Flour is, indeed, very dear, and very hard to come at. But it is because it is very scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The causes to which this scarcity is to be attributed have already been pointed out. The dread of the <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi> by which we were threatened before the people of this city rose in their might and decapitated the monster &mdash; the <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi> which the millers have established for themselves &mdash; but, above all, the manner in which the impressment laws have been executed &mdash; all conspire to deter farmers from sending their crops to market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>We are very sure that when Congress passed the impressment laws it &#x0022;never designed to make them the instrument of starving the cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>But thus they have been used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Everything that is sent to this city to feed the inhabitants is seized by Government commissaries, whether it be wheat, or flour, or hogs, or cattle.&#x0022; Nothing that is food escapes them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>But the other day, as we learn from a contemporary, the <rs>Government</rs> seized <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> beeves designed for this market, and, as a consequence, a large number of butchers' stalls was instantly closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Another month of such management will close all that remain, and then we may get butchers' meat where we can. The impressment law is very defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It should have restricted the operations of the impressing officers to the farms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They should not have it in their power to take <hi rend="italics">all</hi> that is on its way to market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>A portion at least should be left for the inhabitants of the cities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> The impressment law affords in itself the strongest proof of the danger attending the enforcement of a <hi rend="italics">maximum.</hi> The manner in which it has been executed has created intense indignation in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It is a great, but, at the same time, a necessary evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The troops must be fed; but is this the best way to feed them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>We are very much disposed to doubt it. Indeed, we should rather say we have no doubt upon the subject whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>If the markets were open the supplies would flow in abundantly and at once, to the cities as well as the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>As at present executed it is every day curtailing production, some farmers having even gone the length of refusing to seed any more wheat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> It is plain that the law of impressment must undergo considerable modifications if it be desirable that it should not operate in such a manner as to defeat its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>That object is to feed the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>In order that it be carried out there must be wherewithal to do it with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>If the law operate so as seriously to interfere with production, its end of course cannot be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>What improvement or modification may be necessary must of course be left to the wisdom of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It is obvious that the day of volunteering, in every respect, whether in men, money, or provisions, is at an end, as it always must be at an end sooner or later in every revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The day of compulsion has come, and in compelling it is necessary for the <rs>Government</rs> to use so much discretion as not to cheat itself of the end it aims at. It is certain that the <rs>Government</rs> has a right to take whatever may be necessary for its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>But it is under an obligation to pay for what it takes. </p> </div3>
