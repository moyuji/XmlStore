<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In their impulsiveness, generosity, readiness for a fight or a frolic, the <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> and <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> seemed, to <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, very much alike; and, perhaps, also, in another quality: that unbounded capacity of being led estray by demagogues which has caused <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Brougham</foreName></persName> to observe that the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> &#x0022;may be deceived by the same person <num value="9">nine</num> times in succession, and they will believe him just as implicitly the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num>; nay, were he to confess that he had willfully deceived them to suit a purpose of his own, they would only consider this a proof of his honesty, and lend an ear, if possible, more readily to his next imposture. &#x0022; This invincible credulity is as characteristic of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> as of <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We need not mention the incidents of this war which demonstrate the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Nor are the <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> the only people on this continent who have the capacity of believing through thick and thin, and to whom the, &#x0022;pleasure is as great in being cheated as to cheat.&#x0022; In fact, the only exceptions, that we are aware of, are the people of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We must do them the justice to say that they are not generally the victims of misplaced confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Their young affections are not often trifled with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Their mission is to be believed in, not to believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They do not feel called upon to believe in themselves <unclear></unclear> The only possible way to deceive them is to tell them the truth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> If <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> had lived to see this day, another and more painful association between <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs> might have suggested itself to his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He would have seen the dismal destiny of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> hanging over this country in the event of its subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Brougham</foreName></persName>, in an essay from which we have quoted his allusion to <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> credulity, glorifies the <rs>English</rs> people for what he calls their habit of thinking for themselves, and the impossibility of any <num value="1">one</num> making them act upon grounds which they do not comprehend, or for purposes in which they have no manifest interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The people of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> certainly resemble those of Old England in knowing how to take care of themselves, and also how to take care of people who have not that knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We therefore conclude there can be no exaggeration in predicting for the <rs>South</rs>, in the event of subjugation, the same fate as that of <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They are, however, <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>; and not <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> of the highest type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There is no extravagance in concluding that, with even stronger motives to injustice and spoliation than those which have dictated <name>English</name> policy towards <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, they would treat the conquered <rs>South</rs> with no greater moderation and humanity than the <rs>English Government</rs> has exercised towards its <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Generally, it is considered necessary to the defence of an invaded nation that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the men between certain ages, capable of bearing arms, shall be amenable to service in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Here, the black constituted a distinct class, and it was supposed by many that, as they produced the necessaries of life, they would sustain the public defence more successfully in that way than if sent in the field to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>But nations that are hard pressed by powerful invasions leave the production of the necessaries of life to that part of the population which is under and over the conscript ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>She is a formidable ship, but not, as has been over-hastily said, the most formidable afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> It is very probable that point will soon be brought to the test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Our correspondent informs us that the destination of these vessels is this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>It is the place at which, perhaps, they could strike their most effective blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>They could not re-open <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> any more than <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> alone could close it with better ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The timely and judicious distribution of our large iron-clad navy at all threatened points on the coast, and especially at the greater harbors, will be <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> the only proper prevision against the <rs>Stonewall</rs> and the <rs>Rapidan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Our numberless swift blockaders should be already scouring the sea to give timely intimation of the approach of the enemy, and our iron-clads should already be <hi rend="italics">enroute</hi> to their various positions.
