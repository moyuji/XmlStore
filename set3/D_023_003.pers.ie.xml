<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> We have already laid before our readers such accounts of the desperate and determined fight of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> as we were enabled to gather from the most authentic sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>An active participant in that memorable engagement has furnished a detailed account of the part borne by the <orgName>division of <persName n="Hill,General,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName></orgName> in this struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This division went into the fight about <time value="5:30oclock">half past 5 o'clock</time> P. M., and was actively engaged from that time until its close, after <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> at night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The <orgName type="regiment" key="40VARegiment">40th Virginia Regiment</orgName>, <orgName n="Fields' Brigade"><persName n="Fields,Brigade,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Fields,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigade"></roleName><surname>Fields</surname></persName>' Brigade</orgName>, <persName n="Brockenbrough,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Brockenbrough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Brockenbrough</surname></persName> commanding, was deployed as skirmishers, <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> to the right, separating them from the balance of the brigade, which was ordered forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The regiment was then withdrawn as skirmishers, and placed in the rear of the division, which was advancing rapidly to the field in regular line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>After advancing in this order for some distance, they were thrown out upon the left, through a heavy tract of woods &mdash; emerging from which they encountered a strong force of the enemy, who threw themselves upon the ground and awaited the approach of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>When within <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of this body, which we learn, was partly composed of the <orgName type="regiment" key="57NYRegiment">57th N. Y. regiment</orgName>, a most murderous and destructive fire was opened upon them and it is believed that not loss than <num value="75">seventy-five</num> of our men fell from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This, as might have been expected, produced some confusion in the regiment, and they fell back to the woods, hotly pursued by the exultant foe. Many of the regiment, it is believed, were captured in this woods, as at roll-call next morning but <num value="50">fifty</num> were present to respond to their names out of <num value="450">450</num> that went into the fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> On a hill, obliquely to the right of <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s advance, was posted a battery of some <num value="12">twelve</num> pieces, which had been twice captured during the afternoon by our forces under <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, but recaptured by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This battery, the <orgName>brigade of <persName n="Fields,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Fields,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Fields</surname></persName></orgName>--reduced in numbers and worn out with fatigue from their participation in every general engagement since <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>--was ordered to charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>With spirit and alacrity they responded to the order, and with close rank and steady step they moved forward to its execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In their approach to the battery, they fired <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> rounds, and then engaged the enemy with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Here the struggle was bloody and determined, but after a most obstinate resistance, the enemy was driven from his pieces, and pressed back some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> in a hand-to-hand engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This charge was made by <num value="3">three</num> regiments &mdash; the <num value="47" type="ordinal">47th</num>, <num value="53" type="ordinal">53d</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="VA60">60th Virginia</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The other brigades of the division coming up to the support of Fields, finding the enemy routed, commenced cheering vociferously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The Federal General, <persName n="McCall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:McCall,nomatch:0"><surname>McCall</surname></persName>, hearing this cheering, and mistaking the source from whence it came, rode up and said, <q>&#x0022;Hurrah, boys; I am glad you have held the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Hold on for a short time and reinforcements will be up to sustain you!&#x0022;</q> He was accompanied by <persName n="Biddle,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Biddle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName>, his <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, <persName n="Williams,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>, another aid, and <num value="2">two</num> couriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Suspecting that he had, perhaps, made a mistake, he asked what regiment it was that held the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>An officer present replied, the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA47">47th Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>On obtaining this information, <persName n="Williams,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Majors</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> and <persName n="Biddle,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Biddle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major"></roleName><surname>Biddle</surname></persName> and the <num value="2">two</num> couriers wheeled about and endeavored to effect their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They were fired upon, and <persName n="Biddle,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Biddle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Biddle</surname></persName> shot through the head and killed instantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The others, so far as is known, escaped without injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>His sword was received by <persName n="Mayo,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Mayo,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mayo</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The General was particularly solicitous that no indignity should be offered him, when he was emphatically assured by <persName n="Mayo,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Mayo,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mayo</surname></persName> that he had not fallen into the hands of a soldiery unacquainted with the usages of civilized warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Under an escort, <persName n="McCall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:McCall,nomatch:0"><surname>McCall</surname></persName> was then sent to <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> the <orgName>brigade of <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName></orgName> was advanced to the front and drawn up in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Several volleys were fired into the woods where the enemy had taken shelter, which had the effect to disperse them, and the fight closed for the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>During the engagement <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was knocked from his horse by the fragment of a shell striking him on the side of the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He was missed after the fight was ended, and it was feared that he had been captured; but on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> he came in tolerably well, but considerably bruised about the head. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head><dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>'s operations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> During the forenoon of Tuesday there was no regular engagement, but much desultory firing along the whole extent of the retreating and advancing lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In the afternoon, about <time value="2.5oclock">2&#x00BD; o'clock</time>, a brisk fight was commenced on the right of the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of our army, <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s corps, then situated convenient to <placeName><persName n="Poindexter,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Poindexter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Poindexter</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road, and directly opposite <placeName key="possibilities=28" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Turkey Island</placeName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The character of the country here is slightly undulating, the intervening ground between the belligerent parties consisting of open, cultivated fields, whilst the extremes are dense woods of heavy timber and thick undergrowth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>From the situation occupied by our troops, the enemy was discovered in large force deploying their troops, and placing their artillery in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Bodies of skirmishers were thrown out from our column with a view to test the disposition of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This required but a short time to accomplishes as a brisk fire was soon opened upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Our artillery then opened fire upon the batteries of the enemy which had the effect to produce another <q>&#x0022;artillery duel,&#x0022;</q> lasting for <num value="1">one</num> hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, both parties serving their pieces with decided skill and alacrity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> Heavy bodies of infantry were advanced to the support of our artillery, and a general fight ensued, which resulted in the repulse and temporary withdrawal of the enemy; but, ultimately rallying and bringing to their aid a battery on their-right, they opened a fierce oblique fire on the left flank of our forces then in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This fire, which was excessively severe, was continued without intermission, and responded to with spirit by our own artillery until <time value="6pm">6 o'clock P. M.</time> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> An intermission of some half hour then occurred, during which time, according to the representation of prisoners subsequently captured, the enemy at this point were heavily reinforced, when the fight was again renewed, our centre and right of line becoming engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>For <num value="3">three</num> successive hours there was kept up <num value="1">one</num> unbroken roar of artillery and musketry, which, for <unclear></unclear> fierce intensity, exceeded anything that has occurred in the whole series of bloody battles around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The very earth trembled beneath the deafening and incessant peals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Notwithstanding the fatigue and well night exhausted condition of our men, from their almost superhuman labors of the previous <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure>, they entered this fight with an ardor and readiness, plainly indicating their unchangeable determination to conquer of die. About <num value="9.5">9&#x00BD;</num> or <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time>, our artillery ceased firing, having effectually silenced the batteries of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>This, however, it is due to say, was the only perceptible advantage gained by this wing of the army in the afternoon's operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The loss sustained by both contending parties was heavy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It would appear that such a feeling was universal, and that the <rs>Southern</rs> men, rightly or wrongly, identified their cause with the sacred cause of independence and liberty and with love of country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It was not wonderful, then, that throughout the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName> the women should partake of the sentiments which their fathers, husbands, and sons entertained. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> It might have been thought that the sentiments of honor which generally animated the members of a gallant profession would have made it impossible that anything like discourtesy or insult should have been offered to women by the officers of a Christian country in a civilized age. (Hear, hear.) The Northern States having established a military occupation at New Orleans found, as might have been anticipated, a bitter feeling of animosity awakened by the conquest of that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>That feeling ought to have excited their generosity and forbearance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> Did that language mean that the ladies of New Orleans, because they might happen to make some gesture or movement which an officer or soldier might interpret as an insult, were to be dragged to the common jail and subjected to the most degrading association with the vilest of their sex?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>That, of itself, would be the most intolerable tyranny to which a civilized people in our day had been exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>There was another construction which those words might bear, so horrible that it could Hardly be intended by any mind but that of a demon, and be would not, therefore, further allude to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Some honorable gentlemen might think a remonstrance against this proceeding would be a departure from the line of non-intervention, and might lead us into difficulties and complications with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Their boasted Republic is considered an abominable military despotism; their vaunted freedom of thought a sham and a cheat; their free press, except as a sewer of licentiousness, destitute of every spark of manly independence; their national wealth, such as it was, the product of Southern industry; their greatness a thing of the past.
