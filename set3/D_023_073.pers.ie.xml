<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> While the lines were moving forward, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1VARegiment">First Virginia Regiment</orgName>--a mere handful of veterans, who have been in every fight since the war commenced, and most of them the best young men of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; came directly upon a battery of <num value="4">four</num> pieces, which was obstinately holding its ground and pouring its deadly volleys into our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Shot and shell hulled furiously into the little band, but it was no time to stop then, and dashing on with a wild cheer, reached the summit of the hill where the pieces were planted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Their commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><q>&#x0022;Forward, the old <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>--follow me,&#x0022;</q> spurred his horse up to the very muzzles of the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><num value="1">One</num> of the cannoneers was in the act of pulling the lanyard of a gun. Him he cut down with his sabre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Another, attempting to take the place of his comrade, was likewise dispatched, by the now bloody steel of the <rs>Colonel</rs>, and the rest turned to fly. At this instant <num value="1">one</num> of the retreating Federal halted, took deliberate aim, and shot away a portion of the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian's</rs> car, while a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> sent a bullet through his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Hardly had the flash of the <num value="2">two</num> muskets disappeared, however, before the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> paid the forfeit of their temerity with their lives, <num value="1">one</num> of them being killed by Serg't <persName n="Jones,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Josiah,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>. <q>&#x0022;Forward, boys; always forward; don't mind me.&#x0022;</q> cried the wounded <rs>Colonel</rs>, and there he fell among the trophies of his prowess.

Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Roger</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Pryor</surname></persName> during the day had the misfortune to be taken a prisoner, but the corresponding good fortune to effect his escape.--He had started off on foot to call up <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> regiments for reinforcements, and on his return found his command moved from the position in which he had left it. Thinking it had gone ahead, he, too, went on, and on, and on wondering all the time where his men were, until he suddenly encountered <num value="2">two</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers sitting at the foot of a hay rick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>His uniform being covered by a <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> poncho, they did not observe that he was not <num value="1">one</num> of their own men, nor was there any mark visible upon his person to indicate that he was an officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They accordingly familiarly inquired how everything was going on in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He replied, very well, and in the conversation which ensued learned that he was a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> within the <rs>Federal</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They asked him numerous questions, under some of which he began to quake and grow uneasy, fearing his inability, good lawyer though he is, to cope successfully with a cross examination of such a dangerous character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He accordingly began to look about him to discover some means of escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>There was apparently none.--He observed standing near him, however, the <num value="2">two</num> muskets of the men, <num value="1">one</num> of them with a bayonet and the latter without. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The colloquy had not proceeded much further before <num value="1">one</num> of them, looking at him keenly, asked him to what regiment, brigade, and division he belonged, and as <persName n="Pryor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Pryor,Roger,A.,,"><surname>Pryor</surname></persName> hesitated and stammered out his reply, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sprang to his feet and exclaimed, <q>&#x0022;you are a d &mdash; d rebel, and my prisoner.&#x0022;</q> In an instant the <rs>General</rs>, who is a powerful man and active as a squirrel, seized the gun with the bayonet, and before his antagonist could turn, ran him through the body twice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The other now jumped to his feet, apparently as if to escape, but he also received from <persName n="Pryor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Pryor,Roger,A.,,"><surname>Pryor</surname></persName> a lunge that left him helpless on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Throwing down the musket, the <rs>General</rs> moved rapidly away in the direction from which he came, and after dodging Federal stragglers for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, had the satisfaction of finally regaining his command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Anxious to know the fate of the <num value="2">two</num> men whom he had so summarily disposed of, he sent <num value="1">one</num> of his aids the next day to examine the hospitals in that neighborhood, and ascertain, if possible, whether any men were present wounded with a bayonet.--The aid returned with the information that he had found <num value="1">one</num> so injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> &#x0022;Some of the plates, on being struck by several <num value="68">68</num>-pounder shot in nearly the same place, so as to compel a fracture, have exhibited a peculiar silvery appearance in the separated parts of the metal, which have at the same time shown an extraordinary length of fibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> &#x0022;The Atlas Works rolled plates were equally faulty with the <name>Parkgate</name> plates, but constant manufacture and the constant practice at sample plates from both works on the sides of the target ship in <placeName reg="Dorchester, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7013575">Dorchester</placeName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, which are witnessed by a representative from the firms, have supplied such an amount of valuable data to the manufacturer, that they have recovered <hi rend="italics">for rolled armor plates</hi> the prestige they at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> had in their competition with hammered plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> The <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName> ought to have passed the <name>Conscription</name> law within <num value="1">one</num> week after its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It had before it the disasters in which it had well nigh involved the nation by its shameful delay on a former occasion, and now, in the face of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s call for more than <num value="0.5">a half</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> men, and the thinning ranks of our gallant army, it has approached the end of the session without performing its duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It is scarcely possible, consistently with the respect due the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">National Legislature</orgName>, to characterize such delinquency in the language which it deserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It is difficult to imagine that an assemblage of gentlemen supposed to be selected from the best of their follow citizens, on account of their superior wisdom and patriotism, should not comprehend the exigencies and urgency of a situation manifest to the plainest capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Is there a child in the country who has not seen for the last <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> that the only possibility of peace consists in the most powerful and thorough preparation for war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It is only by discarding all dreams of any surrender by the <rs>North</rs> of its present position; it is only by feeling, acting, and organizing as if we were to spend all our future days upon earth in a state of war, that we can ever expect the restoration of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It has now become obvious that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will get all the men he calls for without the necessity of a draft, and if our Congress had acted with the promptitude which the occasion required, the requisite number of men might be already in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Upon the heads of those to whom a confiding people have entrusted the destinies of their country will rest the responsibility of any disaster that may ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The orators who have imperilled a nation's independence for the sake of airing their vapid eloquence will achieve a kind of immortality which no man need covet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> While we are still in doubt and uncertainty with regard to the exact whereabouts of our army, we entertain neither doubt nor uncertainty with regard to its well-being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Had anything disastrous happened to it, we should long since have heard all about it. Ill news flies on the wings of the wind, or, we should rather say, leaves the wind a sightless distance in the near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>If we were to say that it beats the telegraph, we are not sure that we should be far in the wrong, although electricians tell us that lightning can throw a girdle around the earth <num value="24">twenty-four</num> times in the space of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>. <orgName n="Good News" type="newspaper">Good news</orgName>, on the contrary, is slow of foot, and balls in its gait, but when it comes at last, it is all the more acceptable for its tardy appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Let our citizens possess their souls in peace, and wait with patience, as they have often done before in this harassing, tedious, vexations war. No news is of itself good news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We know that our army is in excellent health and spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>We know that it has never been beaten in a pitched battle, although it has fought innumerable actions of that dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We know that they are opposed to foes whom they have defeated in <num value="12">twelve</num> general engagements within less than <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, and whom on last Saturday they drove into the <rs>Potomac</rs> with unheard-of slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We know that they are under the command of a General in whom they have unbounded confidence, and that he, in his turn, has unbounded confidence in them and in the officers who serve under him. This is as much as we can expect to know for the present, and it is a great deal to know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But we know, further, that he has fully accomplished the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great object of the advance into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, which was to capture the army that held <persName n="Harper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><surname>Harper</surname></persName>'s Ferry, and which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> tell us numbered <num value="11582">11,582</num>, (in round numbers, <num value="12000">12,000</num> men,) exclusive of a body of cavalry which they allege to have escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>When before was an army of <num value="12000">12,000</num> men ever captured with the loss of less than <num value="100">one hundred</num> on the part of the captors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>A force of <num value="33000">33,000</num> men surrendered at <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, but the less on the part of the victors was, in the various actions that preceded the surrender, at least <num value="2000">2,000</num>.--<placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName> surrendered with <num value="12000">12,000</num>--about the came number having died within the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>But it cost <num value="12">twelve</num> pitched battles and <num value="60">sixty</num> combat, besides a siege of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, to reduce it. Dantzie surrendered after a siege of several months, during which the garrison was reduced from <num value="16000">16,000</num> to <num value="9000">9,000</num> men; but it cost the besiegers the lives of several <num value="1000">thousand</num> men. <placeName reg="Badajoz, Badajoz, Extremadura" key="tgn,7007395">Badajoz</placeName> was taken by storm; but the victors lost <num value="5000">5,000</num> men. <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName> was taken after a succession of murderous combat, running through <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, and scarcely ever ceasing for a moment; but the <rs>French</rs> lost half their army in the enterprise, while the inhabitants lost <num value="54000">54,000</num> persons of all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/><placeName reg="Sebastopol, Saint Bernard, Louisiana" key="tgn,2650581">Sebastopol</placeName> was carried by storm, after a siege of <measure n="11months" type="date">eleven months</measure>, during which it is said that several <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> human beings lost their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>But the capture of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> was effected with the smallest loss of life, we venture to say, ever known, where the capture was so important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Yet, instead of regarding this splendid result of a whole series of brilliant operations in the proper point of view, we are permitting the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to turn our attention from it by the lies which they manufacture for the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It seems strange to us that any human being can be blinded by such means to the true state of the case. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> <persName n="Kossuth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="mostcommon:Kossuth,nomatch:0"><surname>Kossuth</surname></persName> has published a letter denouncing the call of <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> on <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName> to rise, and repudiating the use of his name in connection with the call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>He says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/> I cannot but attribute this abuse of my name to the manoeuvres of the <rs type="place">Court of Vienus</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>It is not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that its busy agents have abused it in order to cause the <name>Hungarians</name> to engage in desperate <hi rend="italics"><unclear>minutes</unclear></hi> <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> acts in this number at all times when, feeling herself free from any danger of an attack from without she considers herself sure of being able to repress any such movement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/> I am not astonished, therefore, at beholding her active agents lay hold of the proclamation of <persName n="Garibaldi,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>; for, much as <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> fears a combined action by <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and <placeName reg="Magyarorszag" key="tgn,7006278">Hungary</placeName>, she would be more pleased at seeing an isolated insurrection break out in <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName> at a moment in which, in consequence of regrettable dissensions, <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, trembling on the verge of civil war, would not only find herself completely paralyzed, but, what a worse still, placed in danger of engaging in a conflict with the conqueror of <rs type="color">Magenta</rs> and <rs type="color">Solferino</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/> Thus, the abuse of my name, which has just been mentioned to me, imposes on me the duty of cautioning against a fatal error those political friends who gave me the honor to confide in my guidance, and obliges me to declare openly that not only am I a perfect stranger to the appeal to arms which <persName n="Garibaldi,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00253" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> has addressed to <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName>, but that I entirely disapprove of it in the most positive manner, as supremely inopportune and inconsiderate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/> What a moment has the <rs>General</rs> chosen for making this appeal!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>To bring about a collision with the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>--a collision which would inevitably involve the ruin of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>The cry of &#x0022;<placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> or death!&#x0022; If it signifies anything, signifies war with the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> since he it is, and not <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, who mounts guard at the <rs>Capital</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/> Such is the conjuncture which the situation presents to us in support of the appeal to arms addressed to <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>The reasons for making this appeal may be thus summed up: &#x0022;Since the <name>Montenegrins</name> are fighting with <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>; since the relations of the <name>Servians</name> and the <name>Turks</name> are inimical, I (<persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00254" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>) propose to embroil myself with my <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="nearbymention:King,John,,,"><surname>King</surname></persName> and the <rs>Government</rs> of my country in order to embroil them with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and then the moment will have arrived when <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> will have nothing to fear either from the <name>Turks</name>, the <name>Montenegrins</name>, the <name>Servians</name>, the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs> or from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> &mdash; then will be the precise moment for you, Hungarians, to attack <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, for happily for your glory, she will then be prepared to receive you warmly, not being engaged upon any side; more than all, I (<persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>) have taken care to put forth my proclamation.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Kossuth"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/> We may admire the singularity of this reasoning, but we ought not to be astonished that Hungarian good sense prefers waiting for the moment when <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> shall be engaged; or in danger of being engaged, on some point, or at least until some <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> conjuncture may present <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName> with the possibility of arming and ranging her forces in order of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Every patriotic <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> must rejoice at this determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>I know better than any other attack that <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName> is decided on profiting by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occasion of freeing herself from the domination of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/> If the <rs>Hungarian</rs> nation thinks herself able to engage alone in a supreme struggle, without regard to exterior conjunctures, I am ready to partake her risks and her perils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>But in such a case, as she will act without any support from abroad, honor and my conscience tell me to leave with her the responsibility of the resolution and the choice of the moment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/> If, on the contrary, it is intended to drive to arms the <rs>Hungarian</rs> nation by excitement from abroad, I do not hesitate to declare that it does not belong to any persons, and still less to any foreigner, however highly he may be placed, to rouse up a nation without affording it a support which joined to the resolution of the nation itself, would promise a reasonable chance of success. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
