<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>He has the additional advantage of the army of soldiers the army of office-holders, and the control of the votes of the border States, in which there will be no voting allowed save by those who take the oath, and as that must be administered by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s slaves, the votes that it secures must be <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>He has the army; and the army he means to hold fast by favors and grants of Southern estates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>With the army he will make good all the votes cast for himself in this manner, and he will, more than probably, overawe the polls in some States not in rebellion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> If <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> gets the border States, and the revolted States, partly under the <rs>Federal</rs> military authority, he has to start upon: <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> <num value="7">7</num>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> <num value="14">14</num>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> <num value="11">11</num>, <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> <num value="3">3</num>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> <num value="10">10</num>, <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> <num value="5">5</num>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> <num value="7">7</num>--<num value="54">54</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>To these we may add: <placeName reg="Colorado" key="tgn,7007158">Colorado</placeName> <num value="3">3</num>, <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> <num value="3">3</num>, and <placeName reg="Nevada" key="tgn,7007526">Nevada</placeName> <num value="3">3</num>--as they are newly fledged States, still under the dominion of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> officials, whose grasp upon them is not yet loosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>This would give him, to start with, <num value="63">sixty-three</num> votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The remaining States of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> give a vote of <num value="231">two hundred and thirty-one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>To secure him a majority of all the votes cast, he would have to get from these remaining States <num value="85">eighty-five</num> votes.--Now, the question is as to his ability to get those <num value="85">eighty-five</num> votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>If his army sustains no great reverse before the election, and if he is enabled by <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s system of lying telegraphs to mislead the public mind, we do not see that it is so improbable that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will get those <num value="85">eighty-five</num> votes, or that his defeat should be considered more probable than his election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It is true, great opprobrium attaches to his administration; but he has a great deal of power, and may be able to override it and the popular current against the war, and the debt and taxes it has accumulated for the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Indeed, the <rs>Northern</rs> people have shown such a facility of acquiescence in every unconstitutional and inhuman measure for our destruction that it may be inferred they are incapable of perceiving that the power they accord <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to enslave us, by consequence, swallows up the rights and liberties of their own States and people, and that they may yet, for a time, go on blindly sustaining him in his war against us. That they will discover how they have made for themselves a monster for a ruler that will, in turn, fall to devouring them, there can be no doubt; but they may not see it yet, and they may yet for a time cry out, &#x0022;Crush the rebellion &mdash; destroy the rebels &mdash; take their property to pay our debts.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> Thus much may be said for the prospects of the monster who now rules the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Pursuing the speculation, vague as it is, it may be assumed as probable that, although the divisions of the opposition may prevent it from electing a President, it may succeed in throwing the election into the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>; but even then <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has the bribes, and he has the thumb- screws too, in his hands, and stands the best chance with a corrupt Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Yet it might turn out that he would be the lowest candidate, and could not be sent into Congress at all. In that event, taking his past habit of usurping authority, under the pretext of &#x0022;military necessity,&#x0022; to help himself out of difficulty, he might send in his military guards, disperse Congress, and declare martial law until new elections could be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Nor would it be extravagant to suppose he might succeed in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>He has but to play the demagogue, cajole the people, say there was fraud in the election, declare that his proceeding was necessary to save the <rs>Republic</rs>, mix up withal praise of the army and a glorification of the flag and &mdash; would the <name>States</name> resist!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We doubt it. They might, and here is an opening for further speculation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> Reverses to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the next <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, should they be serious, may bring about great changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They alone can checkmate <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and weaken his hand, which is quite strong, as compared with the frantic organization led by the ridiculous <rs>Fremont</rs>, and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> broken in <num value="2">two</num> by the peace and the war divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>But even if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is defeated and another is elected, who can say that he would not, upon some such pretext as fraud in the election and the &#x0022;safety of the <rs>Republic</rs>,&#x0022; disperse Congress and usurp all authority until some convenient season, to be designated by himself, for popular elections ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> Another speculation may be this: that while the opposition may not be able to keep out <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, they may elect a Congress opposed to him. But what would that be to him ? He would soon take the body under his control by bribery and menace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Let him be re-elected and he will be developed more fully &mdash; look out for summary measures: <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">coup de clats</hi></foreign> and decapitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>There will be an end to freedom and independence in Congress when he is re-elected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has not yet shown his hand fully in the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>His detectives have, indeed, been at work, and it is pretended that they have made a startling discovery of plots against the <rs>Government</rs> ! And a plot is a great thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Man,--leading men,--and a great many of them, may be sent to places where they will be harmless to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for a time &mdash; at least, as long as he chooses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>And a great many leaders are said to be inculpated in the plot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Of course that is exactly why the plot was to be discovered ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> The short and the long of all the speculations about the peculiar Northern people and their Government is, that the people have hooks in their nones, and may yet be led by them for some time &mdash; that they have a great tyranny over them, which will use its best means &mdash; its corruptions, its police, its <unclear></unclear> its military surveillance &mdash; to keep the </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> country in with obstruct public <unclear></unclear> and <unclear></unclear> its power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>To throw off such a <unclear></unclear> requires the exercise of a public little and a popular and <unclear></unclear> independence, the existence of which in the <rs>North</rs> is very doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>With successes to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s armies, we are satisfied these elements do not exist in sufficient force to throw off the <rs>Lincoln</rs> yoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Yet they may be strong enough with the help of Southern victories to dethrone the abominate <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 2052" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> ape. And to this complexion comes all speculation on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The armies of the <rs>South</rs> are indeed fighting for the liberties of the <rs>Northern States</rs> as well as for those of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> </div3>
