<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, (Opp.,) of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">La.</placeName>, rose to address the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He said he had supposed that, are this, he would have had official information of the position of affairs in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, but in the absence of it he should assume that he had such information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The South, he said, had repeatedly warned the <rs>North</rs> that they were driving them to a point that would result in a separation, and for this they had only been sneered at and maligned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He (<persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>) wished to speak in no spirit of recrimination, but to perform his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He would call attention to the speech he made <num value="4">four</num> yours ago, predicting this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName> here quoted from the speech he made in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, and in which he said the time would come when the <rs>South</rs> would throw the sword into the scale with all the rights of the <rs>South</rs>, because he did not believe there could be peaceable secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He said that the words he had then uttered had proved to be true to- day. He would to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that the fears of civil war then expressed would prove only fears, but from what he had heard, it almost seemed us if the other side of the chamber desired to bring about a civil war. <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had declared herself separated from the <rs>Union</rs>, while other States stand ready to support her, or else to put her down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>That is the real issue, and there is no use to disguise it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> We are not permitted to ignore the fact that the determination to secede is not confined to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> alone, for next week <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, will separate from the <rs>Union</rs>; a week after <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> will follow them; a little latter <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> will secede, and soon after her <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Now, then, shall we recognize <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> as a free and independent State, or shall we coerce by force?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He argued that the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had a right to declare themselves free; it was an inherent, inalienable right.--<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had, by the voice of her people, met in convention, in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and repealed the ordinance made by her people when they met in convention in <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct>. <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName> here quoted from a speech of <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName>'s, in the <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> case, to show that a convention of the people duly assembled had proper authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He (<persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>) had said that a compact was not binding on <num value="1">one</num> party unless the other parties to it lived up to it, and that a compact broken by <num value="1">one</num> could be broken by all. <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName> here quoted from <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> to sustain his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He (<persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>) said that no <num value="1">one</num> could find any article in the <rs>Constitution</rs> requiring force to be used to coerce a State.--He referred to the old Confederation, and said that line States seceded from it for the express reason that the compact between them was not kept, and finally all the <name>States</name> seceded but <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, leaving them as foreign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He claimed this as a precedent in the formation of the present Constitution to show the right of a State to secede. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Who was to be the judge if a compact was broken?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If a compact was broken in a pecuniary matter, the <rs>Constitution</rs> provided a way to settle the matter; but if it was broken politically, the <rs>Constitution</rs> provided no way.--He read from the debates of the <rs>Convention</rs> which formed the <rs>Constitution</rs> to show that the members of that Convention refused to make the <name>Senate</name> the judge of, or give the <rs>President</rs> the power to veto, the action of a State; that they refused to give Congress the power to negative State legislation, and that they specially refused to give any power to coerce States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Yet when the <rs>State</rs> conventions came to ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs>, complaints were made that the <name>States</name> were not sufficiently secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It must be admitted that certain political rights are guaranteed the <name>States</name>, but when these rights are denied, where is the remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Suppose that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> should send <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> here, and the majority should refuse to receive but <num value="1">one</num>, what power can compel that majority to repair the wrong?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Suppose that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> should then withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, who could say it was a violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Suppose, again, that a wrong is perpetrated which does not appear quite clear to the <rs>North</rs>, but does appear clear to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>--suppose she is denied access to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, is she without any remedy under the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If there is none, then she must be the judge of the wrong and mode of redress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> He read an extract from an address delivered by <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> in New York, in <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>, in which he said nations themselves must be the able judge whether compacts are broken, and also saying &#x0022;that when all fraternal feeling was gone between the <name>States</name>, then it was time to separate in peace and return to their original state.&#x0022; He (<persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>) said that a sectional <rs type="role2">President</rs> had been elected, who could, with the aid of a sectional Senate, grant all the benefits to and appoint from <num value="1">one</num> section all the officers in the gift of the government, and thus ruin the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Suppose that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is in error in believing that wrong has been done her, still that does not alter the issue whether we shall permit her to withdraw or force her back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In reply to the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName> (<persName n="Doolittle,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Doolittle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Doolittle</surname></persName>,) he (<persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>) claimed that a citizen was bound to obey his State government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> say that they will not coerce a State, but enforce the laws against individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But how can they punish an individual in a State for treason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Where are they to find the judge and jury to do so, when all the citizens in the <rs>State</rs> think that he has done right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He (<persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>) said they could not blockade a port without declaring war; they could not embargo <num value="1">one</num> port without closing the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> He claimed that neither Congress nor the <rs>President</rs> had power to go into a State with a military force without the intervention of the civil power.

What may be the fate of this horrible contest, none can foretell; but this much I will say, the fortunes of war may be adverse to your arms; you may carry desolation into our peaceful land, and with torch and firebrand may set our cities in flames; you may even emulate the atrocities of those who, in the days of the <name>Revolution</name>, hounded on the blood-thirsty savage; you may give the protection of your advancing armies to the furious fanatics who desire nothing more than to add the horrors of servile insurrection to civil war; you may do all this and more, but you never can subjugate the free sons of the soil into vassals, paying tribute to your power; you can never degrade them to a servile and inferior race; never, never. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>He had accomplished something even more important than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>He had given the enemy such a taste of his quality that they always, afterwards, entertained a profound respect for his prowess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>They dared not venture on any hazardous enterprise in his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>This step, the <rs>Committee</rs> says, by no means arises from presumptuous arrogance, but from the advanced position which circumstances have given <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> in the line of procedure for the great design of maintaining the rights, security and very existence of the slaveholding States of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> is suggested by the <rs>Committee</rs> as a suitable and proper basis on which to found a provisional government, for the following reasons: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, that said instrument is a work of the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> order in strength and accomplishment; that it was most carefully constructed on comprehensive views; and, after careful examination of its details, that experience has proven it to be a good form of government for those sufficiently virtuous, intelligent and patriotic, to cause it to be fairly and honestly construed and impartially administered; that the settled opinion of this State never has been adverse to its plan of government for confederated States, on account of anything in its structure, but its dissatisfaction is attributable to the false glosses, dangerous misinterpretation and perversion of sundry of its provisions, even to the extent of so covering up the real purposes of legislation as to protect domestic manufactures in <num value="1">one</num> section at the expense of the other, and to estop the execution of the opinion of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>; that it presents a complete scheme of confederation, capable of being speedily operated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>It is contended that some limitation of power and duties to regulate commerce, [perchance other provisions of the said Constitution,] may be desirable, and, in fact, are so.--In the meantime, the <rs>Constitution</rs> referred to will serve the purpose of a temporary Confederation.
