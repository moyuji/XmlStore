<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>They were on the lower deck, in <num value="0.5">a half</num> kneeling posture--<num value="1">one</num> leg bent under the body, closely packed, and perfectly naked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Calleros was in his shirt-sleeves when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw him. Presume that if Calleros was a passenger he would occupy quarters with the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>There was no other cabin on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Other persons could have spoken to him without our hearing it. There was but a slight interval between the hails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Am not positive that he is a Spaniard, but he speaks Spanish very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>I take him to be a Spaniard.--Another man on board named <placeName reg="Sign Post, Accomack, Virginia" key="tgn,2114241">Silva</placeName> also spoke Spanish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> boy does, a very little, but not pure Spanish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Don't remember hearing the others speak Spanish while I was on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Lockhardt, another prisoner, could speak a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Think any nautical man would be apt to get hold of some Spanish phrases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>We were standing about east southeast &mdash; running nearly parallel with the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The papers were in a trunk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> By the <rs>Government</rs>.--A man-of-war has to reveal her nationality before she boards a vessel, but conceals it as long as possible.

<div5 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>[from the <rs>Glasgow Courier</rs>.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/> It can no longer be denied that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are on the very verge of disruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Divesting the question of slavery of special arguments as consistent with the moral law, on which much difference of opinion exists, it must be conceded by all unprejudiced politicians that the <rs>Southern</rs> or slave States stand superior to the <rs>Northern</rs> on this question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> In many respects the interests of the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States are diametrically opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Their climates are also widely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The <rs>North</rs> is agricultural, and would be manufacturing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>To foster manufactures, a heavy import tariff is laid on &mdash; operating, be it marked, to an extent almost beyond belief, against the non-manufacturing Southern States, who have thus, in the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, been mulcted of a sum in shape of import duties positively amounting to some <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Again, without settling the question of slavery in assembled Congress, unjust attempts have been made to plunge the <rs>Southern States</rs> into a servile war, as witness the <rs type="place">Harper's Ferry</rs> raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The Northern States have no more right to do this than we would have to interfere in the domestic concerns of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="Belgie" key="tgn,1000063">Belgium</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>The Southern States, on the other hand, raising cotton, rice, sugar, and tobacco, desire free trade with the rest of the world, and vindicate slavery as a wise institution, by which these valuable products can be raised by <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> labor, alone equal to the heat of the climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>There is much, therefore, in the question which does not at once meet the eye, and which cannot be answered by every shallow declaimer against slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> The Southerners are of the best <name>English</name> blood &mdash; are, in many respects, a superior race to the <name>Northerners</name> or <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--and, high-spirited as they are, will not, in our opinion, quietly recede from their present position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>There remains but to be added that this country would gain vastly by direct trade with the <rs>South</rs>, while the fearful calamities likely to arise from the cessation of even <num value="1">one</num> year's supply of cotton cannot be estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> By the time the bust was finished, the month had nearly expired, and still no letter to announce <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>'s return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/><persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>'s fast-waning sight warned her that her journey must not be much longer postponed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Everything was prepared for her departure; she only waited this letter, when <num value="1">one</num> evening, as she sat in the twilight opposite her cherished bust, she heard his knock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>The very moment he had landed, he had rushed to the train: he could not wait to write and prepare her. Oh, how was it that <hi rend="italics">his</hi> arrival could agitate her thus?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Had <hi rend="italics">she</hi> been away, he should have expected her every hour till she came --she could never have taken him by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>But what was this change in the room?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Where was the easel, the pictures?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>And worse, what was this change in her sweet face?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>So pale, and with so sad a look in her eyes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Ah, these partings were cruel things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Life was not long enough for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>They would never part again; he had made up his mind on that head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/><q>&#x0022;I'll throw metaphysics to the winds, and stick to my profession in earnest,&#x0022;</q> he said; and my <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>'s white fingers shall work for both till I make my way.&#x0022; Poor <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Leaning there her head upon his breast once more, his arms around her, his voice more tender than his words, his kisses on her upturned face, who could have blamed her if, appalled at the contrast between the sheltering love she was leaving and the utter desolation she was going to, her sorrowful secret had escaped her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>But no &mdash; she had thought it all over too often, had seen too clearly what was <hi rend="italics">best for him.</hi> She rallied by <num value="1">one</num> of those almost superhuman efforts that women can sometimes make, questioned him about his uncle's health, about his cruise, smiled away his anxiety about her altered looks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Before he left, his eye fell upon his own bust. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/> <q>&#x0022;So <hi rend="italics">this</hi> is what you have been overtaking yourself with, my cleverest, foolishest <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>The bust is a marvel &mdash; too handsome for me, it's true-- but what's the use of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>The man is your own, heart and soul; what do you want with his effigy? &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> <q>&#x0022;Nay,&#x0022;</q> she said, <q>&#x0022;stand by it a moment, and let me compare the <num value="2">two</num>. &#x0022;</q> And she spanned <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the living brow, and then the other, and passed her hand over the straight outline &mdash; the same in both. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/> He looked at her with surprise. &#x0022;I knew your blue eyes were short-sighted, <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>; but are they so short-sighted as that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Does the sense of touch actually help you here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>Sweetest eyes, what do you mean by overflowing at so simple a question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>And looking into them with unutterable tenderness, he kissed them again and again, and left her &mdash; till to-morrow evening when they would have, he said, a long walk in the <rs>Kensington Gardens</rs>, and talk over their happy future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/> <hi rend="italics">Till to-morrow evening!</hi> Oh, by that time she should be far away indeed --far on the sea that would henceforth forever He between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>And he was gone, and there was so much that remained unasked, unsaid!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Some words he might have spoken to quiet this torture of longing for his voice, some other last look she might have taken more satisfying than this <num value="1">one</num> through her tears!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Then came a fierce temptation to remain <num value="1">one</num> other day, to see him once again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>But she remembered how struck he had been with the change in her looks, even in the closing light of evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>In the broad day, in the open air, he could not fail to notice it far more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Her secret would escape her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>If she weakly yielded to this passionate pleading of her heart for <num value="1">one</num> more hour of happiness, might not the selfish longing grow uncontrollable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Could she trust herself further?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Might she not come to think it most cruel to him to leave him in utter uncertainly of her fate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Might not her once clear judgment become warped as to what was really best for him. She passed a terrible night &mdash; but before the morning came the struggle was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>When <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> called the following evening, she was gone &mdash; her servant gone-- all tokens of her presence gone; only a charwoman there, sent in by the landlord, who knew nothing about the young lady &mdash; only a letter for him on the table, and beneath it the last picture she had painted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/> * * * * * * </p> 
<p> <measure n="5years" type="date">Five years</measure> later, <num value="1">one</num> fine <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> afternoon, there sat upon the deck of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Rhine</rs> steamers, then approaching Dusseldorf, an English group, who formed a striking contrast to the rest of the passengers; an elderly man, of very tall stature, and most imposing bearing, ( <q>&#x0022;the veritable Milord Anglais celuila,&#x0022;</q> the <name>Belgian</name> steward affirmed,) with a green shade over his eyes; a younger man, singularly handsome and interesting in appearance, but with traces of ill health and sorrow on his fine features; and a lovely little lady, who, by merry laugh and sprightly observation, seemed bent upon raising the spirits of her companions to the level of her own. But in this she met with indifferent success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>There was but little mirth in the laugh that her pretty satire elicited from the younger of the <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen, while the elder replied to it by a slight rebuke; <q>&#x0022;Nonsense, <persName n="Carrie,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00463" reg="mostcommon:Carrie,nomatch:0"><surname>Carrie</surname></persName>; let me keep my eyes quietly shut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>I can imagine no amusement in watching the manners and customs of <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> boors, or still more objectionable Cockneys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>I only wish I could close my ears as well to the in tolerable jargon that is going on all around.&#x0022;</q> The young lady sighed a little, and talked to her more responsive companion in a lower tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Arrived at Dusseldor., an English footman almost as majestic as his master, and a French maid almost as elegant as her mistress, were shrill and peremptory in their enumeration and reclamation of all the imperials, dressing-cases, and other packages belonging to <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Trevor,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00464" reg="mostcommon:Trevor,Carrie,,,:1"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Trevor</surname></persName>; while the younger traveller quietly looked out his portmanteau and <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs>, upon which the address, of <placeName key="tgn,7005177" n="1.000 1" reg="heidelberg,karlsruhe,baden-wurttemberg,deutschland,europe">Heidelberg</placeName> was written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/><q>&#x0022; Never mind,&#x0022;</q> he said to himself; <q>&#x0022;my time is my own, and she seemed pleased with the idea of my remaining with them, and hearing Dr. G--'s verdict upon her father's eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Pretty little creature, she has a dull time of it enough with him, I dare say.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>They lingered till the harvest-moon rose and cast its yellow radiance on the broad river, and then they reluctantly returned from a walk that had seemed short to both of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>It was not till he found himself alone in his own room that the habitual look of sadness re-settled upon the fine features of <persName n="Blount,,Fred,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00465" reg="default:Blount,Fred,,,"><foreName>Fred</foreName> <surname>Blount</surname></persName>; but once there, he walked up and down moodily enough, and then suddenly stopping unlocked his dressing-case, and took from a secret drawer a letter and a long coil of very fair hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>The letter looked worn and tattered at the edges with frequent opening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>He knew every word of it by heart, and yet he read it this night over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>It was very short &mdash; contained only these inherent words; <q>&#x0022;It is because I love you so, <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>, that I leave you forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>Trust me, it is best so. Do not pity me too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>While I live, I have the memory of your love; I have you to pray for. You made me very happy; I never knew before how much happiness <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had given to his creatures here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Think of me tenderly, not sadly, as we do of the long ago dead, who loved us so much; we know they must love us still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>Forgive me the pain I give &mdash; believe in me &mdash; it is best for you. Do not sorrow &mdash; but yet sometimes remember that I <hi rend="italics">was</hi> your <persName><foreName>Lina</foreName></persName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/> <q>&#x0022;Strange and inexplicable,&#x0022;</q> said the young man, starting up again, and walking up and down as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/><q>&#x0022;How I have maddened over these contradictory lines!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>How I have exhausted conjecture!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>She loved me, and yet she could leave me in this horrible uncertainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>Could it have been through some caprice of pride?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>Can she have heard of my uncle's objection to our engagement?

This visit to <placeName key="tgn,7005177" n="1.000 1" reg="heidelberg,karlsruhe,baden-wurttemberg,deutschland,europe">Heidelberg</placeName>, however, shall be my last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Old Jobson may have been mistaken after all; it may not have been her that he saw in the <name>Rotter</name> <unclear></unclear> steamer the night of her disappearance &mdash; and even if it were, <placeName key="tgn,7005177" n="1.000 1" reg="heidelberg,karlsruhe,baden-wurttemberg,deutschland,europe">Heidelberg</placeName> may not have been her goal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>It was her father's birthplace, I know; but I never heard her say that she had friends there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>If only this intolerable mystery were cleared up, and I could forget her &mdash; forget her forever! &#x0022;</q> And so the hours wore on far into the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/> Meanwhile, through the fair <rs>Carrie</rs>'s dreams there floated the brightest visions her young heart had ever known; and <persName n="Trevor,Sir,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00467" reg="default:Trevor,George,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Trevor</surname></persName>, whose rest was broken by the anticipation of the decisive visit of the morrow, pleasantly diverted his mind by reflecting that young <persName n="Blount,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00468" reg="nearbymention:Blount,Fred,,,"><surname>Blount</surname></persName> really did seem a good deal taken with his little <persName n="Carrie,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00469" reg="mostcommon:Carrie,nomatch:0"><surname>Carrie</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Old Barlow's scaped race had died, <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> knew, within the last year; this favorite nephew was pretty sure to be his heir; and <persName n="Barlow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00470" reg="mostcommon:Barlow,nomatch:0"><surname>Barlow</surname></persName> was said to be very shaky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>And though, in the meantime, he might not be very well off, there was not an older family among <name>British</name> commoners, and <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> cared more for pedigree thin purse; besides which, in the event of his sight being restored, and his daughter happily settled, the worthy baronet &mdash; a magnificent looking man, as we have said &mdash; had matrimonial schemes of his own. </p>
