<head>Return of Confederate Surgeons from the <rs>North</rs>--<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> treatment of prisoners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday morning <num value="124">one hundred and twenty-four</num> Confederate Surgeons, who have been returned from the different bastilles of the <rs>North</rs>, arrived in this city by the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Schultz</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The statements which they make in reference to their own treatment, and that of our prisoners, particularly the wounded, are in keeping with other statements published of the heathenish treatment to which they are subjected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <num value="1">One</num> of these Surgeons, with whom we had a long and interesting interview, was captured at <placeName reg="Williamsport, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7016329">Williamsport</placeName>, Md. in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> last, where he had been left, in conjunction with others, in charge of some <num value="200">two hundred</num> of our wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>These men were nearly all so badly wounded that it was deemed advisable not to attempt their removal to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, although abundance of time had been allowed to do so had their condition permitted it.--In a few days after the occupation of the town by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, an order was issued for the removal of all these wounded to <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The Surgeons remonstrated, but to <unclear>the</unclear> purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The next day brought a peremptory order for their removal, and, in their helpless and nearly exhausted condition, they were packed off to <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName> and piled away, without comfort, in the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs>, and a guard placed around the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>For a few days they were allowed to send out for their rations, but very soon this privilege was withdrawn, and they were compelled to prepare their own food, as best they could, with the meanest kind of facilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The supply of medicines furnished was totally inadequate to the necessities of the suffering wounded, and they were not permitted to receive the stimulants and delicacies which the ladies of the town brought to the courtyard in profusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In a few days they were again removed and transferred from the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> to the <rs type="place">Seminary</rs>, on the outskirts of the town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> In the meantime all the nurses who had been left to assist in taking care of the wounded were seized as prisoners of war and sent off to prison, leaving only <num value="5">five</num> surgeons to labor with and care for <num value="200">two hundred</num> men, not <num value="1">one</num> of whom was able to do anything for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This force, of course, was wholly insufficient for the care of so large a number, and much suffering ensued from want of proper attention, and a number of deaths resulted where the patient might have recovered if properly cared for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Finally the <rs>Surgeons</rs> themselves were sent off to <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>. <persName n="Newell,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Newell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Newell</surname></persName> was the last who left <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He was informed that he would have to walk to <placeName key="tgn,2087107" n="1.000 167" reg="chambersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Chambersburg</placeName>, a distance of <measure n="21miles" type="distance">twenty-one miles</measure>. He told them at once that he was unable to walk so great a distance, being then, as he had been for some time previous, quite unwell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They insisted, however, that he should try it, and he was started off under guard.--He had not gone far until he became well nigh exhausted, and entirely incapable of making the speed required of him by the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>To accelerate his movements they drew their bayonets on him and struck him over the head with their muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Under this persecution he fainted and fell in the road, when he was caught by the collar and dragged some distance to a house, where he was kept under guard until an ambulance came along, in which he was conveyed to <placeName key="tgn,2087107" n="1.000 167" reg="chambersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Chambersburg</placeName>, and from thence on to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> by railroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> <num value="1">One</num> <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> with whom we conversed was for a time in charge of the wounded at <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg, Pa.</placeName> The treatment received there was in the main kind and humane, very little difference being made in the treatment of our own and the enemy's wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The country people around the place sent in many delicacies, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> surgeons permitted them to be distributed among our wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Of the treatment at <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>, as a general thing, the darkest picture ever drawn by the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> of &#x0022;Life at the <name>Libby</name>,&#x0022; conveys but a feint conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The rations consist of hard tack (except where it is completely excavated by worms) meat once a day, and a kind of slop in the morning which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> politely style coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>No fire has yet been allowed in the quarters of the officers, although the weather has been quite severe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> All the private soldiers heretofore confined In the fort have been sent off to <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>, on the eastern shore of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--a cold, dreary, and bleak place in the winter season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>On the day that the last instalment was sent off <num value="1">one</num> of them was observed by a humane surgeon to be nearly destitute of pants, and in a cold, shivering condition.--The surgeon ran off to his quarters and got a pair of his own pants, and, coming back, asked permission of the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> of the guard to present them to the destitute prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <rs>Lieutenant</rs>'s reply was, &#x0022;No, sir; the clothes he has on are a d &mdash; d sight better than he deserves.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> On <num value="1">one</num> occasion the steward of the hospital lost some money, and <num value="1">one</num> of our Surgeons being found outside of his quarters when it was missed he was instantly accused of having stolen it, and forthwith thrust into the stocks, where he was kept until he fainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He was thrown into what is known as the &#x0022;middle room,&#x0022; a place used for the confinement of cut-throats and thieves of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army, whose crimes are base enough to require punishment even in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> eyes.--Here he was kept until the day before the <rs>Surgeons</rs> were sent off, when he was turned out nearly naked, not having clothes enough upon his person to cover his nakedness.--This young man, who is now in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, is a son of a prominent citizen of the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>, and the charge of theft against him was as false as his treatment was cruel and barbarous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> These are a few of the statements received from <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>, where perhaps Confederate prisoners are better treated than in any other prison of the <rs>North</rs>, because the prisoners confined there are mostly officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> At Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> the treatment of private soldiers, who are unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of the enemy, fare much worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><num value="1">One</num> of the returned Surgeons from this bastille says that at <num value="1">one</num> time last summer they had <hi rend="italics"><measure n="9000" type="prisoners">nine thousand prisoners</measure></hi> crowded into quarters which were insufficient for the comfortable accommodation of <num value="2000">2,000</num> men, and that the suffering among them was indescribable. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> A French war steamer came into <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> yesterday and anchored off <placeName key="possibilities=100" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Hog Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Word was immediately communicated to the camp of <persName n="Rosser,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName> and the <orgName type="regiment" key="12VACav">12th Virginia cavalry</orgName> sent after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> With a view to the proper distribution of clothing and provisions sent by the <rs>North</rs> to these prisoners, a <orgName n="Officers Board" type="board">board of officers</orgName>--nay, <num value="2">two</num> boards of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers, have been organized; <num value="1">one</num> for the quartermaster's and another for the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">commissary's department</orgName>, under whose direction the distributions are made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We were present and saw a considerable lot of clothing in the course of distribution among the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It was conducted entirely by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> board. --<persName n="Sanderson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Sanderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Sanderson</surname></persName>, a former hotel-keeper in New York of a popular Southern house, or a house much patronized by Southerners, was chief of the proceeding, and managed it in a business-like style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It was plain that every facility that could be expected from the most liberal administration of authority over prisoners was given for a fair, a complete appropriation to these men of everything that is sent to them from their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Coming here to invade and desolate the homes of our people they have been captured, and yet they are treated with all the humanity and consideration that could be meted out to enemies coming in the form most in accordance with civilized warfare, and least abhorrent to humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They generally look healthy, and though they may not at all times get the most liberal allowance of food, they get precisely the amount and the quality that is given to our own solders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They certainly show no indication of suffering on account of food. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> A fact which we gathered, among others of considerable importance, was the following: In <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> <hi rend="italics"><num value="65">sixty five</num></hi> men have died on the island, and yet during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> of that time only <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> died ! At the termination of those <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> it was ascertained that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government had broken off the exchange of prisoners, and a feeling of despondency prevailed at once among the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Trifling cases immediately assumed a serious phase, and deaths increased most remarkably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Thus it is seen in this fact how the inhuman Northern Government is persecuting its own soldiers by its deliberate and atrocious plan to starve out the metropolis of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> by compelling an accumulation of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners here to be fed and guarded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It seems to be understood that the great object of the meeting is to get rid, as far as possible, of every vestige and shadow of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We bid any Convention assembling for such a purpose as that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed with all our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It is impossible to estimate the injury that has been done to the cause of learning in the <rs>South</rs> by the introduction of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> teachers, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> school-books, and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> systems of teaching, from the days of the old Revolution to those of the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>If the proposed Convention will sweep them all away with the very besom of destruction they will have done golden service to the cause of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We are thankful that the pride and the common sense of all the world, outside of Yankeedom, revolted from the beastly outrage, and that nowhere else have the spelling and the <name>Yankeeisms</name> of that delectable publication been adopted in books intended for the use of grown up persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>But <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> school-books abound in them to such an extent that, if a parent desire his child to spell better than a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> chambermaid, he must keep these books out of his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>But each of their works is relished just as much by grown persons as by little boys and girls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>We do not fear to be accused of childishness when we declare that there are few books in the <rs>English</rs> language which we prefer to the <rs>Parent</rs>'s Assistant, and that <persName n="Sandford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Sandford,nomatch:0"><surname>Sandford</surname></persName> and <persName n="Merton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="mostcommon:Merton,nomatch:0"><surname>Merton</surname></persName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most delightful books we ever read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The inference is that children are sure to like, in literature, what grown persons generally like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>If the plainness and perspicuity of the language, the smoothness of the style, and the character of the incidents, render it attractive to the child, it will certainly be attractive also to the man or woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>From this it is plain that baby books, or books full of baby talk, are no more adapted to the child than they are to any grown person above the degree of an idiot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>An entertaining book, whether it relate the acts of children or of men, will be read eagerly by children who have naturally a taste for reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>We have heard many persons say that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book they ever read with any pleasure was <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s Translation of the <name>Iliad</name>, and we have ourselves known many children of a very tender age to be charmed with it.
