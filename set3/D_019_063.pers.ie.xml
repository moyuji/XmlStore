<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He said the majority report was the result of a thorough and deliberate investigation of all the subjects referred to the <rs>Committee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Upon the final vote on that report, the <rs>Committee</rs> being comparatively thin at the time, the vote stood <num value="12">twelve</num> in the affirmative to <num value="2">two</num> in the negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He believed that with a full committee, not more than <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> votes would have been recorded against it. He urged a full examination of the subjects reported, and proceeded to discuss the propositions embraced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He passed over the several sections with a brief announcement of their purposes, and said that be considered their adoption necessary to the safety of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He did not regret that the <rs>Committee</rs> had yet been unable to furnish a report upon the proposed amendments to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, for a discussion of the subjects here presented would enable the members to see their intimate connection with the final report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He could not agree with those gentlemen who went for immediate secession without a further effort to adjust the pending difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He entertained the highest respect for their opinions, but could not subscribe to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He believed the people expected the <rs>Convention</rs> to make every possible effort to restore the <rs>Union</rs> as it was, and if all failed, then the last resort might be adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> He proceeded to consider the objection urged against assuming a decided position on these great questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He thought it proceeded from a want of due reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Whenever a great crisis in our National history arises, it is peculiarly proper for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to make a declaration of her rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>No greater or more momentous crisis than the present had ever been presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>New questions had sprung out of the existing difficulties, which it was indispensable, if there was to be any amicable adjustment, to have settled now. If we make demands, we must lay down the principles upon which we make those demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They must be presented in the imperative form of a demand of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He would leave it to the judgment of the <rs>Convention</rs> to say whether any portion of the report could be omitted, without destroying the symmetry of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He then proceeded to consider the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> resolution, which he thought would meet the disapprobation of the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, and even among us it would find opponents when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It reads as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> &#x0022;The people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> recognize the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> principle that government is founded in the consent of the governed, and they concede the right of the people of the several States of this Union, for just causes, to withdraw from their association under the <rs>Federal Government</rs> with the people of the other States, and to erect new governments for their better security; and they will never consent that the <rs>Federal</rs> power, which is in part their power, shall be exerted for the purpose of subjugating the people of such States to the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Committee on Federal Relations"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The Northern people (continued <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Conrad,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Conrad,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Conrad</surname></persName>.</hi>) for the <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> of our national existence, had given little attention to questions of constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The principle that any people have a right to reform, alter or abolish any form of their Government, made for their benefit, was the fundamental principle of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The affirmation here is simply that the people of the several States may, for just causes, withdraw from their association with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If gentlemen were disposed to deny this principle on this floor, it was his opinion that they had sadly degenerated since the days of <date value="1776">1776.</date> Unless it could be shown that the government of the people of a State had been destroyed, or merged in some other form of government, they still possessed this right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>If they had a right to change their form of State government, they also had a right to change their form of Federal government.--He did not regard it as a revolutionary right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He maintained that the proposition was sound and impregnable, established during the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution, leaving the people free to change their forms of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It was originally an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> principle, but was now recognized both in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He then called attention to the language of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> and the <rs>Virginia</rs> <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">Bill of Rights</rs>, where the principle was distinctly affirmed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The report was further intended to deny to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> any right, in any way, forcible or otherwise, to decide the question of the secession of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It affirms that it is not granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It was somewhat remarkable that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, while he admits that he has no power to deal with the question peaceably, should contend for the right of dealing with it forcibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>This alone would present the question in an extraordinary form &mdash; that he has no power to make peace, but has the right to make war. On this point <persName n="Conrad,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Conrad,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Conrad</surname></persName> made a constitutional argument, and spoke of the ingeniously devised bill in Congress for the collection of revenue outside of the ports of entry; but this bill, he said, was directly in contradiction of a provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Not satisfied with this, it takes up the general subject of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> slavery, and, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, an influential organ of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> thus boldly espouses the cause of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and intelligently, nobly, and eloquently vindicates the gallant and generous and much-abused people of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>We willingly admit that their error is pardonable, for they have learned the relations of master and slave only from the work of <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,Beecher,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="default:Stowe,Beecher,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Beecher</foreName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Shall we look for that condition in the lucubrations of that romance, raised to the importance of a philosophic dissertation, but much rather inspired, unconsciously to the author, by the desire of leading public opinion astray, of provoking revolution and of necessitating incendiarism and revolution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>A romance is a work of fancy which <num value="1">one</num> cannot refute, and which cannot serve as a basis to any argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>In our discussion we must seek elsewhere for authorities and material.--Facts are eloquent, and statistics teach us that, under the superintendence of those masters, so cruel and so terrible, if we are to believe <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00270" reg="nearbymention:Stowe,Beecher,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName>, the black population of the <rs>South</rs> increases regularly in a greater proportion than the white; while in the <name>Antilles</name>, in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, and especially in the so very philanthropic States of the <rs>North</rs>, the black race decreases in a deplorable proportion.--How could <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,Beecher,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="default:Stowe,Beecher,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Beecher</foreName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName> reconcile this fact with her extraordinary assertions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The condition of those blacks is assuredly better than that of the agricultural laborers in many parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> &mdash; Their morality is far superior to that of the free negroes of the <rs>North</rs>; the planters encourage marriage, and thus endeavor to develop among them a sense of the family relation, with the view of attaching them to the domestic hearth, consequently to the family of the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It will be then observed, that in such a state of things the interest of the planter, in default of any other motive, promotes the advancement and well-being of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Certainly, we believe it possible still to ameliorate their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>It is with that view, even, that the <rs>South</rs> has labored for so long a time to prepare them for a higher civilization. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> &#x0022;In no part, perhaps, of the continent, regard being had to the population, do there exist men more eminent and gifted, with nobler or more generous sentiments, than in the <rs>Southern States</rs>? -- No country possesses lovelier, kinder-hearted, and more distinguished women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>To commence with the immortal <rs>Washington</rs>, the list of statesmen who have taken part in the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, shows that all those who have shed a lustre on the country, and won the admiration of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, owed their being to that much abused South. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> &#x0022;Is it true that so much distinction, talent, and grandeur of soul, could have sprung from all the vices, from the cruelty and corruption which <num value="1">one</num> would fain-attribute now to the <rs>Southern</rs> people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The laws of inflexible logic refute these false imputations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>And &mdash; strange coincidence-- while Southern men presided over the destinies of the <rs>Union</rs>, its gigantic prosperity was the astonishment of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>In the hands of Northern men, that edifice, raised with so much care and labor by their predecessors, comes crashing down, threatening to carry with it, in its fall, the industrial future of every other nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>For long years, the constant effort of the <rs>North</rs> and a certain foreign country, to spread among the blacks incendiary pamphlets and tracts, have powerfully contributed to suspend every Southern movement towards emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Its people have been compelled to close their ears to ideas which threatened their very existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/> &#x0022;Let the independence of the <rs>South</rs> be recognized &mdash; that servile insurrection openly and boldly preached in the pulpits of the <rs>North</rs> may cease to be of ever-present danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Leave her to her own inspirations, and at her hour, in her own good time, with the assistance of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> &mdash; that is to say, when the black shall be sufficiently advanced to understand that, free or slave, he owes it to himself and society to assist by his labor in the <sic>common weal</sic>--the <rs>South</rs> will herself commence the great work of enfranchisement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Nothing will then prevent it, for free labor will become less burdensome to the planter, at the same time that the entire of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will not find itself threatened in the vital interests of its industrial relations by the <unclear>rth</unclear> of material which would now be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and inevitable consequence of a servile war.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/> A part from the accidental advantages derived from the style in which its history may be narrated by a particular author, the subject of mysticism itself has high claims upon our attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>It has lain at the foundation of many of the most remarkable characters that have made their mark upon the different ages that gave birth to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>We are apt to laugh at it; to treat it with contempt.
