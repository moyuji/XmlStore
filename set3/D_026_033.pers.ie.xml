<head>Another movement of the enemy from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Early yesterday morning intelligence reached the city that the enemy, in considerable force, had reached Bottom's bridge, with the supposed intention of another advance upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>As a matter of consequence, considerable excitement resulted, and rumors were abundant and conflicting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Many believed that the demonstration was made by Beast <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:1"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, with the earnest determination of rescuing the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners now in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, whilst others properly conjectured that it was a feint to divert attention from other, and, at present, more important points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>During the day we endeavored to ascertain something reliable with regard to this new movement, and the result of our efforts, as obtained from the best reliable sources of information, disclosed the following facts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, our pockets below <placeName reg="Bottom's Bridge">Bottom's Bridge</placeName> discovered that the enemy were advancing in some force &mdash; both cavalry and infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The pickets retired before them until the bridge was crossed, when a stand was made, and the farther advance of the enemy awaited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In the meantime a supporting force had been sent down to the bridge, and preparations were at once made to dispute its passage by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>At day light yesterday morning the anticipated attempt to cross the bridge was made, but easily repulsed, when they formed a line of battle, and it was readily supposed that they intended to make another effort to cross the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, but finding our men resolution their purpose of maintaining their ground, after remaining in line of battle for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> retired, whether to give up the struggle altogether, or to await further reinforcements, is not known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The announcement of the approach of the enemy induced the requisite preparation upon the part of the authorities here to insure them a proper reception, and hundreds of our citizens girded on their armors to go out and resist the advance of the invaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> <hi rend="italics">Whilst attention</hi> was directed to this quarter, a report obtained currency that the enemy were making a movement on the <rs>Rapidan</rs> and that they had crossed that river in considerable force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This report, though not together without foundation, was greatly enumerated as to the magnitude of the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We learn that the enemy did yesterday morning cross the <rs>Rapidan</rs> in force sufficient to compel the retirement of our pickets, but without making any formidable demonstration withdrew before night to the north bank of the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> Before we had gone very far we learned that we were probably going to <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName>, and it seemed more than probable that we were, and we anticipated a jolly time pitching into the negro troops there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>After marching through a vast marsh, which seemed interminable, we accomplished about <measure n="20miles" type="distance">20 miles</measure>, and struck a dry spot, where we rested in the dark, not being allowed to kindle fires, and, exhausted, soon fell asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Long before light we were off again, and our advance captured the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> outpost pickets, and pushed on; but the alarm was given, and a volley or <num value="2">two</num> of muskets told us that our passage was disputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Rapidly we pushed ahead, but on arriving at Bachelor's <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> it was ascertained that a regiment of the enemy was posted in strong earthworks, and had destroyed the flooring of the bridge, preventing further pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Our regiment was acting as skirmishers, and after a great deal of shooting in the dark we were ordered to protect ourselves and remain where we were, and I was just nicely settled behind a great stump to finish my nap. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Before the sound had died away, volley after volley was fired by our friends over the water, and the <rs>Minnie</rs> flew thickly amongst and over us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>For about an hour this furious firing was kept up, when, as if by mutual consent, the firing ceased, and all was again still and pitchy dark; but I did not attempt to resume my nap. As the light dawned an occasional shot greeted our cars as a rifleman imagined he got a glimpse of his foe. A heavy mist hung over the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, and, although our lines were but <measure n="25yards" type="distance">twenty- five yards</measure> apart, the morning was far advanced before we could distinguish objects across the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>By degrees we were able to distinguish the strong line of fortifications along the edge of the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> on both flanks of a powerful block house which commanded the approach to the bridge. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> Before the fog had raised our cannon again belched forth, and was again met with volleys of <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName>, and during this furious shower of shot and shell the right of our line succeeded in pushing through the marsh and effected a crossing, flanking the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>A vigorous attack was made by our noble boys, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were driven out, and began falling back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>We rushed upon the bridge, laid our pontoon planks, crossed, and joined the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Charging with a yell, we broke the line of the cowardly skunks, who mizzled from their cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>In the twinkling of an eye our artillery was galloping after us, and was wheeled into position, and engaged a battery of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> which had just opened on us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Though we pushed on as rapidly as our legs would carry us, they were soon far ahead and the last we saw of them they were far ahead, to our left, hammering after a train of cars loaded with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops.
