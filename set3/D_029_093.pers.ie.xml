<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> In the year before the war, the <rs>Virginia</rs> <orgName n="Medical College" type="college">Medical College</orgName> had about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Its prosperity had been gradually, but steadily increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Under the auspices of such scientific and popular gentlemen as composed its Faculty, it could not be otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The patronage which had been so liberally bestowed upon the schools of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and New York was being diverted and applied to the establishment of an institution of our own, which embraced all the advantages of the <rs>Northern</rs> colleges, with facilities essential to Southern students which could not be obtained elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The war did not materially diminish the number of students; indeed, we believe it was as great during the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war as at any former period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The value of the <rs type="place">College</rs>, in furnishing the <rs>Southern</rs> armies with a corps of educated and skillful surgeons, cannot be overrated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The <orgName n="Medical College" type="college">Medical College of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName> has again resumed its duties under a Faculty embracing gentlemen of great and varied abilities, and who are devoting themselves with extraordinary energy to the re-establishment of the institution in the confidence of the public, and in more than its ancient usefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It seems to us, however, a great burthen, that the <name>Faculty</name> of a college which is State property, and the smallness of whose fees is utterly inadequate to the compensation of their labors, should be compelled to pay from their own pockets for repairs to the buildings and for insurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>By some unaccountable oversight, the <rs>State</rs> has made no provision for the preservation and protection of its own property &mdash; an omission which should be promptly rectified by the present Legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The medical profession has always been a favorite profession in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and, perhaps, in no other State are a body of physicians to be found more distinguished by general intelligence and classical attainment, in addition to scientific and professional knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The confidence and respect entertained for them by the people has been shown in many ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>There is no atmosphere in which quackery has less chance to live than <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is the duty of the <name>Legislature</name> and the public to sustain an institution which will preserve the efficiency and dignity of the profession, and encourage a Southern college, which must, of necessity, have superior advantages for the treatment of Southern diseases over those of any other latitude. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We can easily believe that they slaughtered <num value="50">fifty</num> black men for every white man that was killed, for that is the uniform <name>British</name> style of putting down rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They were absolutely blown from the mouth of cannon &mdash; a device of vindictiveness and cruelty unheard of before in the revenges of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In their hot haste to punish those villains who had mutinied against such a blessed government, they sometimes slaughtered friends as well as foes, just as they lately did in <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>When the thirst for vengeance is glutted, and the leonine appetite for blood is perfectly appeased, it is the uniform custom of the <rs>British</rs> lion to moralize, and reproach himself for his excessive voracity and destructiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>To hear him at his penitential exercises, after he has devoured several barbarian tribes, <num value="1">one</num> would think him the most pious and tender-hearted of brutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He always continues in this remorseful and self accusatory mood till some new temptation arouses his appetite, whereupon he springs from his recumbent position, and roars, and rends his prey with redoubled ferocity, always ending, however, as soon as he ceases to be hungry, with the old whine of his sensitive conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We are not at all surprised at the uproar in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> over the wholesale butcheries in <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName>, but it amounts to nothing Another rebellion could be put down with the same crushing and sanguinary energy. </p> </div3> </div2> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/>

<head>The Dispatch &mdash; its success.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> In days by-gone the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch</hi> had a horn which hung upon a nail in the editorial room, and which was occasionally taken down and loudly blown to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>When well winded, its tone was clear and distinct, quite agreeable to the blower and to those who head it. So well did he love the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch,</hi> that the tones of the horn were sweet to his ears; and to the public, which had an equal affection for the little pet, they were like felicitous music!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Now, this horn, and a <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName>'s</hi> dictionary were all that was saved from the conflagration of the <date value="04-03">3d of April;</date> and we propose to give a gentle blast upon a much-esteemed instrument, which has been so long silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Thus: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> Ho! all men &mdash; friends and readers, here and everywhere!--the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch,</hi> once the general favorite, whose name rang in every valley, and was re-echoed from every hill in the land, is rapidly retrieving its old place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Its long rest has but given it added energy, and it begins its career anew with the activity and enthusiasm of a boy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Its style and character exclude it from no fire-side, and its cheerfulness and intelligence invite it to all. To all it must go. The want of mails and post-offices in some districts of the <rs>South</rs> checks its spreading circulation, and will do so for a time; but they will soon be supplied by the <rs>Government</rs>, and the paper will then be found, as it is now in the city, everywhere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> The <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> was the <hi rend="smallcaps"><orgName n="General Advertiser" type="misc">General Advertiser</orgName>,</hi> as it was the <hi rend="smallcaps">General Newspaper</hi> <hi rend="italics">for the people.</hi> The past <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> puts it entirely out of the woods as to circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It is already the general newspaper, and of course it must follow that it shall be the general advertising medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Formerly it went everywhere &mdash; its circulation in <num value="1">one</num> day was greater than all the daily newspapers in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>To that point it is to come again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Present indications plainly show it. As we labor for the public good as much as for our own &mdash; knowing that our prosperity is in the ratio of the service we render the community &mdash; we regard the rapid prosperity of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> with a sort of patriotic satisfaction!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Come, then, old and new friends, readers and advertisers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Let's meet on this platform &mdash; on this ground, and help on the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> and ourselves!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The day is very near when men will derive pleasure from considering themselves among its earliest supporters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> With this gentle winding of our horn, we return it to its accustomed place, and bid the reader &mdash; good morning! </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Work ahead.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> The new year is approaching, when men must wind up, as well as they can, the past, and open their books for the coming year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Commercially and agriculturally, there are matters for the gravest consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The work that is ahead will admit of no child's play &mdash; no temporizing in the hope of postponing responsibility &mdash; of delaying an exigency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Commercially, there will be a crisis within the year which all ought to prepare to meet in the best manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Economy is the sevenfold shield that will protect a community best from a financial revulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It should be practiced by all. Merchants should not venture too far; their bills payable should be reduced in number and amount as much as possible, and there kept until the storm is past and we can see more clearly into the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Housekeepers and heads of families should cut down their establishments to a moderate standard, and diminish their outgoings, at least, so that they should not exceed their incomings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>By practising this system of economy wherever it can be applied, the community will be infinitely better off. No spirit of speculation and wild adventure, with a bold reliance upon chances, while so dark a future is immediately at hand, should tempt men to incur very heavy responsibilities just now. Caution and prudence are now our best friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>A little patience for a few months will enable us to come to better and safer conclusions, and to take new measures and adopt new policies, with better lights ahead to guide us safely on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> Agriculture, upon which rests the commerce of the land, has to undergo radical changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>There must be entirely new systems adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The new mode of hiring labor &mdash; and that free labor &mdash; forces upon the farmer this change as a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>There are some advantages in hired labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>You are not responsible for it when disabled by sickness or the infirmities of age; and you may dispense with it at times when it is not needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It buys its own clothing, feeds itself, and pays its own doctor's bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>When the service of this kind of labor is rendered and paid for, there is an end of it. You know what it has cost; you know what you have made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>You are involuntarily led into a system of calculation, and forced to that balancing of accounts which not only shows you how you stand, but compels you to settle up. This is <num value="1">one</num> advantage over slavery, and will make the farmer a better business man than formerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>He will be driven to a more close and compacted system of cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He will diminish his area of tillable soil, and apply his hired labor under his own eye to better advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>His spare land he will soon sell off; that which he retains, by prudent tillage, with a reduction of useless animals, which have heretofore consumed so much and yielded so little, will enable him at the end of the year to have more ready cash than he has been accustomed at such a time to call his own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> These matters will give the farmer a great deal to do. He ought to consider them well and proceed intelligently with his operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>He has yet to see whether the freedman will work &mdash; will perform his contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But there can be no satisfactory settlement of that question unless the farmer prepares his plan of operations and arranges the whole system of his farm in a manner to institute a proper and efficient superintendence and accountability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The old slipshod mode will not answer at all. Slaves did not do half work under the old system, and it will be expecting too much of freedmen to hope that they will do any better than slaves under the same system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The freedman must have a fair trial under a good system, and then, if he does not answer, we can try some <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>But there is no alternative now but to give him a proper trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He is, we believe, still kindly disposed, and if he is kept clear of the demoralizing influence of the vicious and idle who crowd the cities, we by no means despair of him. The pinching demands of the present winter will have a beneficial effect upon his disposition, and we may find that his life may be systematised and his labor directed so that he may become useful and independent; i. e., a good laborer that takes care of himself and his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Nothing short of this, we all know, will answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>If he cannot do this he must go. This, too, if he does not know now, he will in due time learn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> These matters contain enough to occupy the attention of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Everything depends upon the manner in which they are treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Every man who, by his forecast and energy, so fashions and arranges his own affairs as to secure success and avoid disaster, will promote the general welfare, both by what he saves or makes, and by his excellent example to others. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>It is generally kept up in some sort till the commencement of the new year, when the influence of egg-nogg begins to abate, and turkeys &mdash; happily for the community &mdash; come down.

<head>The split.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>That such is the object there cannot be a doubt; that there would be any necessity for so long as absence from their duties, and so much political man&#x0153;uvering as it implies, unless a catastrophe were imminent, no <num value="1">one</num> will believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The crack in the body which, at the opening of the session, presented a surface as smooth, as clear, as cold and as hard as the ice of the <rs>Northern</rs> ponds, became perceptible before the adjournment; and as it is beyond the power of man to reunite the fragments of ice when once cracked through and through, so we take it, not all the politicians will be able to put together again the parts of this huge party when they shall have been rent completely asunder. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> The Radical party of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> carries within itself the seeds of a speedy dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It may live long enough to do much mischief, but the period of its duration must naturally be short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>No party which comes into power upon a single idea can long retain its ascendancy.

<head>House servants.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> The pleasures of the <name>Christmas</name> times in former days were subject, in our cities, to a serious drawback in the annual hiring of house servants by the majority of house-holders, who were often deprived of domestic service at a time when it was most needed, and were compelled to trudge, day after day, through mud or snow to the hiring offices, in quest of servants for the ensuing year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>We are now subject to a discomfort of even more frequent occurrence, but which is a prevalent matter of complaint in other countries, as well as our own &mdash; the disposition of servants to change their places every month, and sometimes in less than that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where domestics often grow grey in the service of the same family, is the only country, that we are aware of, which does not suffer from this capriciousness of domestics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We are glad to learn that the officers of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> have endeavored to impress <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> upon the minds of the freedmen the importance, both to their employers and themselves of making contracts by the year, and of faithfully abiding <unclear></unclear> their contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>This is good advice not only to field laborers, but to house servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Whilst they have the perfect right to change their places as often as their fancy dictates, it is undeniable that, to employ that right, when it is not demanded by an improvement of their condition, is not only to entail great inconvenience upon their employers, but to injure their own interests, and to diminish the increased value which their labor would command from that reputation for stability and reliability which is gained by long and faithful service in <num value="1">one</num> household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Their minds ought to be disabused of the absurd idea that there is no realization of their freedom while they remain in the service of the same persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We have already referred to the fact that, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, household servants often continue in the same family from youth to old age, and it would amuse them to be told that, by so doing, they forfeited any of the liberties of a free-born Briton.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/> &#x0022;There being no antecedent government to our own, it is necessary to look into the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself to see what powers were originally conferred upon Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>These being stated, Congress is authorized to pass all necessary and proper laws to carry them into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>These powers are to be so construed as to effect the object they are designed to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>It is the duty of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> to ascertain this, and then determine whether the legislation will defeat or secure the end. A restriction to the class of powers is that Congress shall pass no <hi rend="italics">expost facto</hi> law or bill of attainder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>The meaning of this is well understood to be any law which makes an act a crime which was not a crime when the act was committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>But the law of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> does punish in point of fact, because it precludes the petitioner from the exercise of a lawful occupation, and strikes at a profession in which his hopes and ambition, and support of himself and family, are involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>The punishment is severe, cruel, and unexampled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>It subjects him to all the obligations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> while it takes from him all its advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>The original act of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> was not made applicable to attorneys in the courts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <measure n="3years" type="date">Three years</measure> were suffered to elapse, when some <num value="1">one</num> in Congress, who may have been peculiarly sensitive, and who saw danger in every man who had taken part in the rebellion, introduced a bill applying the provisions of the law to practicing attorneys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The bill was submitted to the <orgName n="Judiciary Committee" type="committee">Judiciary Committee</orgName> of the <name>Senate</name>, and by an unanimous vote was rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>It afterward, however, received the sanction of the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>It was passed for the purpose of excluding the petitioner and all others similarly situated &mdash; to punish by excluding them from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>It was not for conduct subsequent, but antecedent to the passage of the statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>This act comes within the clear meaning of the clause in the <rs>Constitution</rs> that Congress shall pass no <hi rend="italics">expost facto</hi> law or bill of attainder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>No rights can be taken away by law unless the accused shall be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> convicted of the offence charged; and these rights include the holding of office of emolument and trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Such laws as that of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> were penal statutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> had argued last Friday that the admission to practice in the courts is not a natural right, but is created by law, and therefore may be regulated by law, and either given or taken away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>But it is not true that Congress can by law prohibit the appearance of counsellors in the courts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>The Constitution provides that parties charged with crime shall have the benefit of counsel, and therefore Congress has no jurisdiction over that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It is true that every court is vested by the common law with power to make regulations to exclude improper officers; but Congress has no right to say who shall or who shall not appear as counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>The obligation which is imposed on Congress to create courts carries with it an obligation on the part of the courts to admit counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The safety of the citizen depends on the existence of the provision for the admission of counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>The preservation of liberty demands, as illustrated by the history of the world, that there should be such a body of men. In all the revolutionary struggles and despotisms which have disgraced the world, the accused have been denied counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Congress would convert itself into a tyranny if, while establishing courts, it should exclude such a class of men. The act of Congress under review compels a man to swear against himself, while no power is given to the court to inquire into the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>No man, by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is compelled to testify against himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The petitioner, with others, was involved in the effort to establish their separate independence of the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and resisted it by levying war. The punishment for treason anterior to the passage of the act of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> was death or imprisonment; but this act imposes an additional penalty, that persons thus accused shall not be admitted as attorneys in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>Congress, in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, passed a law saying, whenever the <rs>President</rs> deemed it proper he might declare a general amnesty, while the <rs>Constitution</rs> confers upon him the exclusive power of granting pardons and reprieves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The pardon places the recipient of it in the position in which he stood before the commission of the crime, makes him a new man, and divests him of all antecedent consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Suppose this law of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> had been made a part of the act for the punishment of treason, and the man committing the crime had been pardoned, would it not also have exempted him from the punishment for the offence, and prevented him from being excluded from practicing as an attorney in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> courts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>The pardon covers every part of the offence, and Congress cannot, after the pardon has been granted, pass a law to punish for the offence pardoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>The disgraceful fact is presented to the world that Congress undertakes to interfere by denying the power of pardon, as conferred by the <rs>Constitution</rs> exclusively on the <rs>President</rs> without limit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Congress cannot say to the petitioner, you shall be tried for treason after having been pardoned.
