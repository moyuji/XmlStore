<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Life in the <orgName n="Army of Mississippi" type="army">Army of the Mississippi</orgName> is like the boys' game of <q>&#x0022;see-saw.&#x0022;</q> How you go up to the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> heaven of expectation on the end of some imaginary contingency, and now you come down to mother earth, with some thumping disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Such has been the experience of the last <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>. <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, everybody talked <q>&#x0022;fight,&#x0022;</q> from the <rs>Generals</rs> down to camp cooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Everything indicated fight from the individual preparing his <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> rations to the mass already in motion, and a prophet might have staked his reputation upon the probability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Yet, here we are at the end of the week-nobody hurt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> quietly in his nest, we in our quarters, the rain coming drearily down, mud <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> deep, roads impassable, and a battle, to all appearance, as remote as ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The fact is, <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> is disincline to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Every offer of battle we have made &mdash; and they have not been a few &mdash; he has pertinaciously refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Perhaps he is not ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>If so, his very lack of readiness shows his weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Perhaps he is waiting reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Then he shows a proper appreciation of Southern prowess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Perhaps, and this is doubtless the true cause of his delay, he is fortifying himself to prevent his total rout and annihilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A wise precaution Like <persName n="Raglan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Raglan,nomatch:0"><surname>Raglan</surname></persName> and Prissier before <placeName reg="Sevastopol', Krym, Ukrayina" key="tgn,7012057">Sebastopol</placeName>, he is coming at us by a series of regular approaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>When he gets sufficiently near, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he will let fly his long-range guns, shoot shells over the tree tops, and <q>&#x0022;bomb&#x0022;</q> us out. This done, his cohorts will issue from their dens and storm our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Then, if not before, will come the tug of war. Strange to say, nobody yet fears him, and what may be stranger still to him, he may possibly find the recoil so much stronger than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> report that he will <q>&#x0022;fly the track.&#x0022;</q> Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are not idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Eyes are watching every Federal movement, and reports come from the other side of the lines with on even regularity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> We know, for instance, that <persName n="Sigel,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sigel</surname></persName> has just landed at <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburg</placeName> with <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> troops; that star-gazing <persName n="Mitchell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> is on his way, and that other reinforcements will augment the <rs>Federal</rs> army to a strength of about <num value="90000">ninety thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>More men than this I do not believe they can muster into service, and if these stay where they are <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> longer, <measure n="15000" type="sick">fifteen thousand sick</measure> will be subtracted from the above sum total. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The health of our army is, on the contrary improving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Well's lately bored are supplying pure water, vegetables are beginning to come in from the surrounding cities, and with these changes in the dietetic, corresponding changes are manifest in the physical condition of the troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The Northern journals, by the way, set our strength down at <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men. Prisoners concur in this statement, and say that a similar belief prevails throughout the <rs>Northern</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Hence an indisposition on the part of the men to cross arms with us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Another tit-bit of intelligence we have is, that for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> the <rs>Federal</rs> have lain on their arms expecting an attack from us. Deserters from the army convoyed information of certain movements which apparently led to this belief, but the fact that such a demonstration did not take place shows that deserters as well as newspaper correspondents are liable to be mistaken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> A very considerable number of desertions have taken place within the last <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, but fortunately not to the enemy's lines.--The renegades consist mostly of Tennessean who are separated from their families, or those whose terms of service have expired, and who have been forced to continue in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Many of these have been retaken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> A singular recapture was made on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. A man ran through our lines, but not knowing the country, unwittingly returned again, and was hailed by the picket on duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> <q>&#x0022;Oh, you needn't be afraid of me,&#x0022;</q> was the response; <q>&#x0022;I'm as good a Federal as you are.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> <q>&#x0022;What are you doing here?&#x0022;</q> said the sentinel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> <q>&#x0022;I'm a deserter from the <rs>Southern</rs> army, and have come over here to give you some information.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> <q>&#x0022;What is it?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, the <rs>Confederates</rs> are preparing to whip you like h--<num value="11">11</num>, and your <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> ought to know it.&#x0022;</q> And he proceeded to give some other facts, which need not be mentioned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> <q>&#x0022;I reckon you've got in the wrong box,&#x0022;</q> said the picket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><q>&#x0022;I am a Confederate soldier, and these are the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines.--You are my prisoner.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Calling the officer of the guard, the man was delivered up, and the next day confessed his crime to <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Irvin,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, saying that his heart was not in the work, that he was an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> by birth, and started to desert to the enemy for the purpose of telling them all he knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>On the strength of this information, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Irvin,,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> dispensed with the formalities of a Court-Martial; and ordered the man out to be shot, which was done without ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I saw another shot the day previous, convicted of being a spy. Such things, however, have become common in the army, and draw only such a crowd as may happen to be within hearing distance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The last information at hand corroborates all we have received from the <rs>Federal</rs> for the last <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>. They are concentrating troops heavily on our right and bringing forward their masses from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Probably their base of operations is <placeName reg="Pea Ridge, Benton, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009193">Pea Ridge</placeName>, a slight elevation about <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles distant</measure>. On this may be erected their strongest works, to which those immediately in front are mere covers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Their rear division on the centre is at <placeName reg="Monterey, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090885">Monterey</placeName>, while <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> on the left and <persName n="McClernand,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:McClernand,nomatch:0"><surname>McClernand</surname></persName> on the right, have moved heavy portions of their commands to a close proximity with our lines. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Always on the alert, the victors of Saturday received their old enemy with characteristic decision and dash, and after more than <num value="1">one</num> hour's engagement drove them into a run, capturing many spoils, and placed pickets on the newly conquered ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>From every indication, the foe did not at all relish the idea of rehearsing <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>'s operations in that quarter, so they decamped expeditiously whence they came, after fighting long enough <q>&#x0022;for the looks of the thing.&#x0022;</q> The number of killed and wounded on either side was respectable in total, although it is impossible to state what the <rs>Federal</rs> loss might be, since they seem to have unlimited and well organized facilities for rapidly conveying their killed and wounded to the rear, which precludes the possibility of attempting any computation of numbers. </p>
