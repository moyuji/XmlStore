<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>From late Northern papers we make up the following additional news: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The <rs>North</rs> to be conquered.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are taking a new view of the war <hi rend="italics">Harper a Weekly</hi> is shaking about the invasion, and says that the <rs>South</rs> promised long ago to conquer the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It concludes an article on the subject as follows </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Well fellow Northerners, they will make their words good unless we believe in ourselves as heartily as they in themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They have ranged their class and their civilization against ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is useless to disguise the scope of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Their system must be annihilated or ours must.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We must conquer and subdue them utterly or they will absolutely overcome us. After <measure n="16months" type="date">sixteen months</measure> of war they are flushed with hope and confidence; but their purpose is no stronger now than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They have always meant conquest of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They hoped it would come by peaceable secession, and then a peaceable surrender of the <rs>North</rs> under the name of reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But they believe now that the same practical result can be achieved without separation. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The last advices from New Orleans say an attack on <placeName reg="Upper Town, Nye, Nevada" key="tgn,2741155">Carrolton</placeName>, <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> from that city, was daily expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The old Confederate defensive works were being strengthened by the <rs>Federals</rs> to resist an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The troops left early in the morning in the train, and after proceeding a short distance rebel pickets were seen advancing &mdash; The train was stopped and the troops alighted and an advance was ordered to feel their way. While engaged in this work a large force of guerrillas rushed from the woods, where they were previously imperceptible, and fired, killing and wounding our pickets before they had time to exchange bullets &mdash; Then another volley came, and subsequently a deadly engagement, in which the greater part of our troops were wounded, including the officers. </p> </q><bibl n="Northern paper"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the rebels having spied the fireman on the train, instantly discharged his piece and killed him in the hope of capturing the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In this effort, Lowever he was happily foiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The rebels, it is said, soon afterwards retired to the woods apparently under the impression that the company were only the advance guard of a regiment approaching, leaving the troops to return to New Orleans with the report of the reconnaissance. </p>

The city has not been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Only a few houses about <num value="20">twenty</num> in number which intercepted the range of our fortifications on the interior, have been destroyed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The rebels have become bolder and more insolent since the departure of our army from <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, has a melancholy but very truthful editorial on the present aspect of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We bespeak for it as attentive perusal </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The summer campaign which was to have given us the rebel capital, has come to a disastrous end <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is relieved, and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is besieged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>That magnificent army, organized and drilled with so much care by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> a year ago, repulsed <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, has been again repulsed in its advance upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from the <rs>North</rs>, and now seeks safety for itself behind the forts which line the <rs>Potomac Disguise</rs> it as we may, the <rs>Union</rs> arms have been repeatedly, disgracefully, and decisively beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The whole campaign against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> has proved a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The rebels have resumed the offensive, and have driven our troops back to the precise position they held after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs> more than <num value="1">one</num> year ago. Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> do not seem to be aware whether they intend to attack us there, or push forward on some other time of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><num value="1">One</num> thing may be deemed certain &mdash; they will not sit down in front of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and attempt to reduce it by siege.--They will either attempt a flank movement upon it, or what seems to us still more likely, they will push a powerful column directly into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and strike a blow at the <rs>Union</rs> cause on loyal soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> There is a class of public men who think it highly unwise to admit that we have suffered any serious reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They have copious explanations of the apparent checks our forces have sustained, and abundant assurances that they are all to be redeemed in the immediate future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We regret that we cannot share their credulous confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>All their explanations cannot change this fact, that wherever we have met the rebels &mdash; whether behind an earthwork, as in front of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, or in the open field, as in front of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> &mdash; they have beaten us. Sometimes they have outflanked us; sometimes they have got completely in the rear of our forces; sometimes they have thrown their whole force upon a single weak point of our line and so overborne us by numbers; sometimes they have drawn us into an ambuscade; but it matters not how &mdash; the fact remains that they have beaten us. And all that these various explanations amount to is that their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are bolder and more skillful and their armies more effective than ours.--This is all that anybody can ask in war. And it is worse than idle &mdash; it is childish and idiotic to attempt to shut our eyes to the glaring and repulsive fact that thus far in the war the rebels have the best of the fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The sooner we realize our actual condition, the sooner shall we find a remedy for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> What is the cause of these awful disasters?--Not in any lack of men, for our armies outnumber the rebels <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Not in lack of arms, of munitions of supplies &mdash; of all the means and appliances of successful war &mdash; for no army on the face of the earth has ever been so lavishly supplied with all these as ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Not in the goodness of the cause &mdash; nor in the spirit of the people &mdash; nor in the valor and patience of our soldiers, for in all these respects we may challenge the world to surpass us. We are driven to the conclusion that the rebel <rs>Generals</rs> have been superior to ours; that the rebel Government has been better able to wield skillfully and successfully the weapons placed in its hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><hi rend="italics">Results </hi> afford the only test of military capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The army that conquers is always the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Large or small, ragged or well clad, hungry or full, armed or unarmed, the army that drives its enemy off the field is always the better of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Our forces have been splendidly drilled, admirably clothed and armed, and always supplied with abundant food; but they have been defeated, and that fact overrides all others, and brands them as inferior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> We all hope that all this is to be changed; but so we have been hoping for the whole year past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The very next step was always to turn the tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We were to have <q>&#x0022;no more Bull Runs, &#x0022;</q> when <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> took command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The enemy was to be <q>&#x0022;driven to the wall&#x0022; </q> after he had evacuated <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.--The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, it was declared, shall enter <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, after it had suffered defeat behind its own fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>And there were to be no more retreats on our side, after <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> took the lead toward the rebel capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Yet, in spite of all these assurances, made with confidence, and eagerly welcomed by the credulous country, our armies are besieged, but all <q>&#x0022;safe&#x0022;</q> in the <rs>Potomac</rs> forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Who can say that the tide of disaster has yet been stayed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>What is there to turn it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We have fresh men in the field &mdash; but so we had before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Possibly the enemy cannot take the forts &mdash; and, possibly knowing that fact, they will not try. But if we can judge the future from the past, they will be very likely to attempt something which they can accomplish, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we shall know of it will be that it has been done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> We see no ground for predicting better results <hi rend="italics">so long as we employ the same means.</hi> We have the same <rs>Generals</rs>, the same policy, the same Government, the same <rs>President</rs>, and the same Cabinet as we have had hitherto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We enter upon the future under the same auspices precisely which have presided over our past disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>What possible reason, then, have we to expect a change?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The entire responsibility for all these calamities rests upon the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; simply because all the <hi rend="italics">power</hi> is in its hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> that many of our commanding <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are incompetent &mdash; that they waste in personal wrangling energy that should be given to the cause &mdash; that they are weak, irresolute, incapable, and therefore unsuccessful &mdash; the <rs>Government</rs> is responsible for their failures, because it has the power to displace them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A General may fail once through his own fault; if he fails a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time the fault rests with those who kept him there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>War is no time for elaborate experiments, or for patching up shattered reputations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> needs to reinforce his Cabinet with new vigor and new ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Without any impeachment of his own capacity, the <rs>President</rs> must have a strong Cabinet or he will have a weak Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The ablest of our <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> have been the ones who have surrounded themselves with the ablest men. The theory that <rs type="role" reg="Cabinet-Officer">Cabinet officers</rs> are more secretaries, and therefore not responsible, does not avail; each <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> carries not only into his own department, but into the whole policy of the <name>Administration</name>, the spirit, the vigor, the energy of his own nature; and if the <rs>Cabinet</rs> is made up of <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> weak men, they will inevitably give the country a weak Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>We need now the strongest Government the country has ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>And it needs no prophet to predict that, without more strength, more vigorous power, a larger grasp, and more energetic mastery of the resources which the country is pouring into the hands of the <name>Administration</name> than we have had hitherto, the <rs>Union</rs> cause is doomed to a speedy and disastrous overthrow. </p> </div4> </div3>

We can never move with <num value="1">one</num> hearty purpose while angry feeling is excited, or prejudice aroused through the disturbing influence of personal squabbles or party politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>We can never concentrate our strength upon the <num value="1">one</num> great paramount question of crushing out the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, until we cast aside all discussion upon the irrelevant and distracting topics of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>We can never strike the <rs>Rebellion</rs> with all our power until we are united in heart and in purpose as <num value="1">one</num> man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> It is no uncommon thing to find men of unquestioned patriotism, men who have given largely of their means, men who have risked their live in the conflict, men whose sons and brothers are now in arms for the <rs>Union</rs>--it is no uncommon thing to find such men still standing apart from the <name>Administration</name>, because of their belief that the war was provoked by the agitating Abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>This is the staple of their replies to all appeals for close, warm, friendly, generous, hearty support of the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>They overlook the stern and urgent realities of the present to gaze unprofitably at the unalterable past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> On the other hand we have a set of restless, persistent and reckless political propagandists, and noisy, mischief making, office hunting, and contract seeking partizans, who make a decounterpoise for the short sighted and obstinate politicians of the opposition.

<head>The advance into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> There are timid persons who still determine to consider this last movement of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> as full of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>That it is dangerous to a certain extent, is true enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>No military operation ever was, or ever can be, entirely destitute of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>War itself is a very unsafe game for any man to play and of course none of its moves are perfectly safe.--<placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was thought to be a cautious commander, and to a certain extent he was so. Yet his <num value="2">two</num> movements across the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, resulting respectively in the battles of <placeName reg="Trenton, Gibson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101856">Trenton</placeName> and <placeName reg="Princeton, Mercer, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119659">Princeton</placeName>, were hazardous movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>He had a choice of evils before him on both of these occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He could either remain quiet in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, with a beaten and disheartened army, and wait for the enemy to besiege him in overwhelming force, which he certainly would have done as soon as the ice broke up, or he could run the risk of being cut off by crossing the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, and carrying the war into the very heart of the enemy's camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case destruction was slower, but it was in evitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>In the last case, there was a fair chance of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>He chose the bolder and more generous alternative, and he was completely successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Fortune never smiles on any <num value="1">one</num> who is not willing to hazard something in order to obtain her favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was not in the condition of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>He had been victorious until applause for victories achieved had, no doubt, begun to pall upon his taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>He had just defeated the enemy in a series of battles remarkable for their brilliancy and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The most dangerous position he could have assumed, under such circumstances, was <num value="1">one</num> which implied inaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>If he had fallen back the enemy would have advanced, as soon as reinforced, upon the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and reoccupied all his old positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>If he had remained stationary, his position would have been identical with that of our army last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We have always maintained, and we still maintain, that the true danger to that army lay in its inactivity after the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>.--It would not have been, as far as we have ever been able to understand the matter, hair so dangerous to have crossed at once into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, where it would have met nothing but raw troops, thoroughly demoralized by the defeat they had so lately sustained, and ready to fly at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> crack of a gun. By remaining stationary at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, with the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> and <rs>James</rs> both in its rear, and both accessible to the enemy's gunboats, it gave time to that enemy to recover from his panic, to make soldiers out of his recruits and to threaten it on front, flank, and rear, with <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> men. That it escaped destruction we reckon among the miracles of this war, which has been fruitful in strange events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Had the enemy been guided by the dictates of the most ordinary sagacity, we see not how all the talents of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>--great as they are known to be &mdash; could have extricated it from its perilous position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>And in precisely such a position should we be now had <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> halted a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> The movement which <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has now made is bold, but it is sagacious, and justified by the highest military authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>There are precedents enough in its favor, and perhaps we shall be excused for citing <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The result was an armistice, by which the <name>Austrian</name> army became, to all intents, prisoners of war, so far as any operations in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> were concerned. </p>
