<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The morning of the <date value="06-03">3d of June</date> dawned upon the busy multitudes engaged, as is their custom at this season of the year, in their industrial pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Instantly, parties of both old and young vied with each other in spreading far and wide the intelligence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>At an early hour this morning hundreds of our citizens had repaired to the rendezvous, determined to welcome the invader from every mountain gorge with a murderous salute from our unerring rifles in the hands of our mountain boys, who know how to handle them with telling effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Hastily getting under arms we marched thither, when we found that the cannon had been fired as an alarm signal, intelligence having been received that the enemy were landing at a point some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Embarking on a boat at the landing, we rowed ourselves across to <placeName reg="Shams' Point">Shams' Point</placeName> opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We were followed by several companies encamped near here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Landing, we found a company of gallant Tennesseans and <orgName n="company"><persName n="Lewis,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lewis,E.,M.,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Lewis</surname></persName>' company</orgName>, of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, drawn up ready for moving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> The Washington Government started out in this war with a debt of a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num>.--Its expenses per diem of all sorts cannot be far less than a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>By the meeting of Congress there will be a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of deficiencies to meet, and a prospective expenditure of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300000000">three hundred millions</num> to authorize and to provide for. If a public debt be a public blessing, the <rs>North</rs> is soon to be immersed in an ocean of complete beatitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war will find a debt of <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of dollars, and the prospect of an indefinite increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The only limit to the debt will be in the capacity of the <rs>Northern</rs> market to take up the loans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>That capacity is not very great, for your <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> capitalists are, in general, but mere agents for foreign lenders of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>In all New York there are not a <num value="100000000">hundred million</num> of dollars of genuine New York capital for loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>All the rest of the money they have had at command has come from abroad, and belonged to foreigners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/> Debentures of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> cannot command sale for a very long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>They are but the obligations of a sectional Northern Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The South has withdrawn and will never consent to pay any part of the debt now growing up. It will be a debt of the <rs>North</rs> alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Probably <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> will have the felicity of sharing in its burden to the extent of <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> cash; but except such part as the <hi rend="italics">prudent</hi> States of the border shall share, it will be a debt of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>As such it cannot command favor among foreign capitalists; for these people know very well that all the financial power and commercial wealth of the <rs>North</rs> were derived from its dealings with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>There is not enough capital in the <rs>North</rs> to support a large increase of the public debt, and the <rs>Government</rs> before a great while will </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/> be bankrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The Treasury is already in a state of collapse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> expedient they will resort to, after exhausting the resources of public loans, will be a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> is already calling out lustily for a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>, with a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>They will authorize <num value="1">one</num>, of several <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num>, and the <rs>Government</rs> will employ all the agency and resources of that institution to sustain its credit and to supply itself with money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The Washington Government itself will subscribe to its capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Each Northern State will subscribe liberally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Beef and other contractors of the army will subscribe some of their hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of profits; and other fortunate speculators, looking to further little favors and to further good luck, will take many shares.--It will be a stupendous affair, a colossal machine, a magnificent bubble; and thus, with a high protective tariff, a huge <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>, a mammoth public debt, and a vast standing army, all in full blast, the <rs>Northern</rs> ideal of a great and strong Government will be completely realized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> What will be the condition of the people all this time?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The stoppage of Southern trade and the cutting off of its Southern markets will bankrupt their manufacturers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>The loss of the coasting trade of the country and of the carriage of Southern staples will destroy their shipping interests and bankrupt all their <hi rend="smallcaps">Laws</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Vanderbilts,</hi> great and small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Their merchants will lose their business and go to protest; and the bankruptcy of the <rs>East</rs> will bankrupt the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Bankruptcy will soon be as universal as the war fever has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>It will be a Nemesis at the heels of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/> Already their editors see these things, and the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> mingles with its prayer for a great <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>, still more urgent appeals for a general bankrupt law, to wipe out all debts.--They feel that they are all going to ruin together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>They want <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName> notes for a fictitious currency with which to bolster up their affairs awhile; and they want to postpone the evil day of protest by means of loans from the few <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of new fictitious <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>But, in spite of these palliating and dilatory expedients, they know the end must come, and they want a general bankrupt law to fall back softly upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>They want to stop payment with something still in hand for a rainy day, and they want a bankrupt law to protect them from the <rs>Sheriff</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Probably a bankrupt law wiping out all old debts will be followed by demands for an agrarian law, making a new division of property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/> With a public debt, a protective tariff, a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>, a grand army, and all these fine agencies of magnificent speculation in full blast, the system would lack its most important part, its most beautiful and charming feature, if it lacked a general bankrupt law; and a general bankrupt law they will have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>When men are provided with unlimited means of speculation, they must be also provided with a convenient means of release from debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>With all these great institutions in full play, the <rs>Northern</rs> genius will find itself at last in an element exactly suited to its character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>I tell you further, there is not a man among you who will dare to return to <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, except as a soldier in victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Do you ask me why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Because we are engaged in a great and holy war of self-defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/> In after ages, when history records the transactions of this epoch &mdash; when the passions of men shall have subsided, and the historian can take a calm and philosophic view of the events which have led to the present collision between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, he will write that the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> understood and protected civil liberty; and that the misguided <rs>North</rs> either did not comprehend, or abandoned it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The spectacle of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, the man who stands at the head of the principal department of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> &mdash; the man who has illustrated in his life, for more than <num value="4">four</num> generations, all that adorns honor, virtue, and patriotism &mdash; a native-born citizen of your own <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName>--<persName n="Taney,,Roger,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="default:Taney,Roger,B.,,"><foreName>Roger</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName> &mdash; that man has put his judicial flat of condemnation upon the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for its shameless abandonment of the very corner-stone of our liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>There he still remains,<q>&#x0022;a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,&#x0022;</q> to direct the welfare of our nation in this atrocious aggression upon our nation in this atrocious aggression upon our liberty. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>What is your mission to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>You tell your own tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>You have arms in your hands; you are under a gallant leader, and you are to march under a flag honored by the ladies of your own State, worked by their own fair hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>You are here not merely to fight our battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>No, I am not so selfish as to presume that; but to fight the battles of civil liberty in behalf of the entire <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>And you are on a high mission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/> You are not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Marylanders who have crossed the border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>We had in the days of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Revolution a <placeName key="tgn,2047886" n="1.000 55" reg="maryland line, baltimore, maryland">Maryland Line</placeName>, whose name has passed into history without <num value="1">one</num> blot upon its fair escutcheon &mdash; a <placeName key="tgn,2047886" n="1.000 55" reg="maryland line, baltimore, maryland">Maryland Line</placeName> who illustrated upon every field in the <rs>South</rs> their devotion to the civil liberty of that day &mdash; a <placeName key="tgn,2047886" n="1.000 55" reg="maryland line, baltimore, maryland">Maryland Line</placeName> who, in the remote savannahs of the <name>Carolinas</name>, spilled their blood like water at <placeName reg="Camden, Kershaw, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095449">Camden</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Guilford Court-House">Guilford Court-House</placeName>, at the <name>Cow</name> pens, and at <placeName key="tgn,7014152" n="1.000 7" reg="eutaw, greene, alabama">Eutaw</placeName>, where the last battle was fought, and the enemy finally surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>They were your ancestry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>They travelled bare-footed, unclothed, without blankets or tents, and but few muskets, and you came after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>But you have this peculiar distinction: You are volunteers in a double sense &mdash; you are volunteers for the war, and you are volunteers for the great cause of the <rs>South</rs> against the aggressions of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>You are no strangers; you are our neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>My own home is upon the confines of your State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>I went there <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> ago, immediately after <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had denounced the unholy movements in the <rs>North</rs>, to learn the spirit of your people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>I went to Frederickstown, where the <name>Legislature</name> were assembled, anxious to ascertain whether <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> could rely upon you in the hour of trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>I knew the political incubus by which your people were crushed to the earth; but such were the indications I perceived on every side, that when I returned to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> I unhesitatingly reported that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>I staked my word upon it as a man of principle and a man of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The giant arm of the oppressor has been too strong for the time being, but the spirit is still alive, unsubdued and unrepressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>You are here to confirm this fact by your presence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/> You are in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>What is <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>It is a large city &mdash; a city of gallant men and refined women; a city whose inhabitants are engaged in all the useful and honorable pursuits of life tending to the advance of civilization and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>At the present moment, however, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> is a huge camp, where but <num value="1">one</num> mind, <num value="1">one</num> heart and <num value="1">one</num> determination animates every occupant, man, woman and child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>[Applause.] Our wives, mothers,--and I appeal to the ladies if I may not also say our sweethearts,--have entered into it with a zest which shows that their hearts and affections are fully in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>You will have no child's play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>There is no time now for vain boasting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>I confide as much as I can in the prowess of the men of this section, and you will be false to the fame of your fathers if you are not victors; but your enemy relies upon mere brute force.--There are doubtless brave soldiers among whom it will be hard to conquer, but you will remember that you are fighting for your fathers, mothers and firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>They are mercenaries fighting for pay, you are men fighting for your homes and rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>All you require is subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/><q>&#x0022;Give us,&#x0022;</q> you say, <q>&#x0022;the means of living, the arms to fight with, and show us the enemy.&#x0022;</q> [Applause.] It may be that in the providence of war, not <num value="1">one</num> among all those who are before me will return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>You have come here if necessary to lay your lives upon the altar of your country, and I feel assured that every man will do his duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> I will tell you an incident connected with the <rs>Alabama</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>They were attended by a minister of the <name>Gospel</name>, who was a guest at my house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>He told me that he had with him a purse of gold which had been given to him by the parents of <num value="2">two</num> young men in the ranks with the injunction that it should be sacredly preserved during the war, unless his sons should fall upon the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Then, said the father, <q>&#x0022;Give them a Christian burial.&#x0022;</q> There was a patriot father who had devoted his sons to the service of his country, and that man does not stand alone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/> Such is the object with which you have engaged in this war. The true duty of the soldier is not merely to fight a battle or kill an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>He has also to endure the trials of the camp; the weariness of the forced march; the vigilance of the day and night; the restraints of discipline, and the patience to bear with his discomforts and disappointments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>This is the real test of courage, and he who comes out of the war with the reputation of having thus done his duty through sunshine and through storm, is the true man and the thorough soldier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/> But I will not detain you longer, except to discharge the grateful duty which remains, of presenting to you in behalf of the ladies of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, this beautiful banner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>There it is unfurled before you for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>There are emblazoned the <num value="15">fifteen</num> stars of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, looking prospectively to the day when they will all be with us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The star of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is among them, and the women of your State have put it there, confiding it to your safe-keeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Look upon it as a sacred trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>In passing through the storm of battle, it may be tattered and soiled, but I believe I can say that you will bring it back without a spot of dishonor upon it. But you are not only to return that flag here &mdash; you are to take it back to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>[Cheers and cries of <q>&#x0022;we will.&#x0022;</q>] It came here in the hands of the fair lady who stands by my side, who brought it through the camp of the enemy, with a woman's fortitude, courage and devotion to our cause; and you are to take it back to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, unfurl it in your streets, and challenge the applause of your citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>While getting ready, about <measure n="15minutes" type="date">15 minutes</measure> later, some of the men being mounted, and others away, a citizen ran up to the stable, and with tears streaming down his face, begged the men to fly, as the troops were almost on us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>I ordered the company to form, and while they were doing so, several of the men (myself among them) not having mounted, the head of the enemy's column appeared about <num value="4">four</num> squares off.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/> The war in which we are now engaged, so far as it affects property, is a <hi rend="italics">public</hi> war, and <hi rend="italics">not a civil war.</hi> The <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, in the year <date value="1796">1796,</date> decided that the war between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the <name>United Colonies</name> was, prior to the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, a civil war, but after that declaration it became a public war between independent nations, and the rights of public war attached to the new Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>By remaining neutral, the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> recognize our authority to exercise the rights of a belligerent nation engaged in public war, although they have not acknowledged our claim to separate national existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/> Every nation at war with another is justifiable by the law of nations to seize and confiscate all <hi rend="italics">movable</hi> property of its enemy of every kind or nature, wherever found, whether within its territory or not. But the confiscation of the enemy's property is not a necessary consequence of a declaration of war; the sovereign authority may exercise the right or not at its option. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/> The modern usage of nations is to abstain from the confiscation of debts due to an enemy, or his property found within the territory at the breaking out of war, but such usage is a mere guide which the <rs>Sovereign</rs> may disregard at his will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>Unless confiscated by the act of the <rs>Sovereign</rs>, the right to such debts and property is only suspended during the war, and revived with the return of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>But the <rs>Government</rs> has the right to confiscate or absolutely extinguish debts due from its citizens to the enemy, and such confiscation would be a good defence to a suit upon those debts, brought after peace was restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Citizens of our enemy cannot sue in our courts, and voluntary payment of debts to them will doubtless be prohibited, because of the aid such payments would afford the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/> Immovable property, such as lands and houses, possessed by the citizens of <num value="1">one</num> Government in the country of the enemy are not subject to confiscation, but the income therefrom may be sequestered in order to prevent its being remitted to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/> The property of neutrals must be respected everywhere, as far as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>Arms, ammunition, naval stores, and generally all articles, are contraband which may assist the enemy in hostile operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>Even provisions, coal, &#x0026;c., are sometimes regarded as contraband, their character depending much upon the necessities and position of the enemy. </p> </div3>
