<head>[for the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>.]<lb/>the position of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Of the slave States yet attached to the despotism of the <rs>North</rs>, probably the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> are the least responsible for the degrading position she now holds as a subjugated province of the <rs>Washington Administration</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Since the commencement of our national difficulties, the sympathies of this State have been warmly enlisted in behalf of the <rs>South</rs> and its rights; and although beset with difficulties innumerable, this sympathy was often and unmistakably evinced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But, to conceive of the disinterestedness, and to show that the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> acted only from principle, let us review the position she has held since the commencement of our present troubles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Occupying the position of a border State, and having the <rs>National Capital</rs> within her boundaries, she was from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> threatened by the collection of the military to guard (?) the inauguration of the <rs>Abolition King</rs>, and with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> still in the <rs>Union</rs> and between her and the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, her people could only patiently look forward to the action of the Old Dominion as the signal for their own escape from the disgrace and thraldom which, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>has overtaken them &mdash; Joined to the unfortunate temporizing of the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName> was the fact that the people were disorganized, and with the traitor <rs>Hicks</rs> at the head of their Government, the <name>Legislature</name>, although honest and loyal to their constituents, were unable to act, and, without and official call from the <rs>Executive</rs>, could not take their destiny in their own hands, and so, perforce, were compelled to await the action of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.--Every <num value="1">one</num> knows of the uprising of that outraged people to repel the onward march of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hirelings to crush a people who possessed their every feeling of sympathy, and with whom they would fain have cast their own lot; and every <num value="1">one</num> knows of the perjury of their Governor, who, being terrified at this great uprising of a free but outraged people, hastily convened the <name>Legislature</name> and proclaimed that no troops hostile to the cause they all held so dear should, with his consent, invade the sacred soil of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Since that day her subjugation has been going on steadily, <hi rend="italics">sneakingly,</hi> almost imperceptibly, until now, a military despotism is established, whose ultimate object is to crush out the last vestige of freedom from her soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This is being accomplished, as it were, like a huge reptile encircling its victim, who at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> struggles violently in its grasp, and then, as the pressure is for a moment suspended, though not relaxed, the victim becomes temporarily quiet, and remains still and exhausted in the folds which encircle it, when again <num value="1">one</num> coil is tightened, and thus, from time to time, till the poor struggling creature becomes dead and passive in the folds of its executioner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>So are the liberties of the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> being crushed out steadily but surely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The insult offered by the march of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> troops through the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> has been followed by numerous others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The arrest and incarceration of <persName n="Kane,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Kane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Kane</surname></persName> without indictment or trail, the subsequent disbanding of all the police of that city, and the substituting of their own hirelings, and the disarming of peaceable, law-abiding citizens, were only the prelude to other insults not less outrageous; nor have these outrages been confined to the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>My own native county of <placeName reg="Washington, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,1002995">Washington</placeName> has suffered not less severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Although the most western county of the <rs>State</rs> but <num value="1">one</num>, and contaminated as it is by the borders of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> as its northern boundary, the majority of the people are of warm Southern feelings, but are held in subjection by a Northern army and a low, armed rabble, who are urged to commit outrages at which their instigators hold up their hands in holy horror. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Murder and rapine do their deeds unrebuked in the broad light of day. <persName n="Rench,,D.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Rench,D.,C.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Rench</surname></persName>, a young and promising lawyer of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, while on a visit to his parents in this, his native county, was brutally murdered &mdash; shot down and stoned to death &mdash; and his horse, on which he had rode from his father's farm to the village, was sent as a <q>&#x0022;trophy&#x0022;</q> to the army, then at <placeName key="tgn,2087107" n="1.000 167" reg="chambersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Chambersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>His parents were informed that they might have the body, provided they came and took it away in <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, and asked no questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <rs>Sheriff</rs> of the county was also given a similar space of time in which to make his exit, when he came to make inquiries concerning and arrest the parties who had perpetrated the atrocious died, and thus the matter ended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <persName n="Alvey,,R.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Alvey,R.,H.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Alvey</surname></persName>, a member of the <rs>Hagerstown</rs> bar, was arrested and sent down to <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi">Fort McHenry</placeName>, and from thence to <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>, all for entertaining supposed Secession sentiments, the only charge being brought against him was that he had said that <q>&#x0022;<num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> regiments would put to flight the whole of <persName n="Patterson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><surname>Patterson</surname></persName>'s ragged army.&#x0022;</q> Subsequent events lead us to the inference that he was a <hi rend="italics">far-seeing man.</hi> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> The great struggle which now rages throughout our country excites the most intense interest at home and abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is needless to argue to ourselves or the world of the justice and propriety of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We patiently yielded to every expedient, and listened to every promise in behalf of that Union around which had so long clung our interest and dearest affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But suddenly the mask was raised, and we saw before us the sword of the tyrant, and henceforth there was no hesitation in our course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> An extra session of the <name>Legislature</name> immediately convened and with no dissenting voice submitted the issue to the people in Convention, which unanimously passed the <name>Ordinance</name> of separation and deliverance, and that act has been sustained by the people with a unanimity unparalleled in the history of the political struggles of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The unanimity of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> in this great struggle, while it must insure success, will embellish a page in her history brilliant as the victory which achieves her independence. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The expenditures of the <rs>State</rs> have been, and continue to be, very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The great and hurried demand for troops in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has strained every point to equip and send them forward as rapidly as possible; and it has been the aim of the authorities to furnish our troops with every comfort consistent with our means.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> It is mortifying to our State pride to think that we have hitherto been so dependent on the <rs>Northern States</rs> for even the means of defence, including all the munitions of war; and apprehensions have been felt among us that the want of these might impair the means and resources of maintaining this war. But from a recent survey made by our able State Geologist, <persName n="Emmons,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Emmons,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Emmons</surname></persName>, I am gratified to state that we have in our midst, within a few miles of the <orgName n="North Carolina Railroad" type="railroad">N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The most valuable ingredient of powder (saltpetre), is found abundantly in the limestone caves of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>A company is now engaged in the western part of this State for the manufacture of powder, and if any assistance is required, I would suggest that the <rs>State</rs> should furnish aid for the purpose of facilitating the supply of this necessary material, which the blockade of our coast now effectually cuts off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The blockade of our coast, and the non-intercourse around our borders, have established <num value="2">two</num> very important facts: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, That in our commercial relations we have become almost entirely dependent upon the <rs>North</rs> for almost every article that we use connected with machinery, farming, merchandize, food and clothing, both the luxuries and necessaries of life, including almost every article needed for our defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and more important fact is now established that we have the means and material for supplying all these wants within our own borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Necessity is developing these resources and driving us to the use of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> The continuance of this war and blockade for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> may inflict much personal suffering, but it will accomplish our national and commercial independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> If the war was to terminate soon, our political rights might be secured, but trade would resume its old channels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Time alone will successfully divert the course of trade; but when once diverted, it becomes more difficult ever to restore it. Once check and turn off the great flood of Northern trade, and Southern labor, Southern trade and Southern capital will roll their strength together to establish Southern prosperity and independence; and it is equally important to us to establish our commercial as our political independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>A decisive victory may establish our political rights in a single day, but a continuance of the war and blockade can only accomplish the other. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> To us the blockade and war is a sharp but temporary pain, but it is a slow consumption preying on the vitals of Northern wealth and commerce. </p> </q><bibl n="Gov. Clark"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The mechanical arrangements in connexion with the experimental line of cast-iron tubing &mdash; which, like a huge black <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs>, stretches for more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile along the river side &mdash; are few and simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Under a temporary shed a high-pressure steam engine of <measure n="30horsepower">thirty-horse power</measure>, made by <orgName><persName n="Watt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Watt,nomatch:0"><surname>Watt</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, and having its cylinder placed at an angle of <num value="45">forty-five</num> degrees, is erected, and it gives direct motion through the medium of a crank to a large disc of <rs n="sheet iron" type="product">sheet iron</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> The disc runs on tubular bearings, and narrows from about <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> in breadth at its centre to <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> at its circumference, its diameter being <measure n="18feet" type="distance">eighteen feet</measure>. Its interior contains simply <num value="4">four</num> arms, to which the sheets of iron are fastened, and which serve as fans or exhausters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Through the hollow bearings upon which the disc is made to rotate at a speed of from <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="200">two hundred</num> revolutions per minute, a communication exists with a vacuum chamber below, and by the laws of centrifugal action the latter is speedily exhausted, to a certain extent of air. The speed, in fact, of the disc determines that extent, and a water barometer registers it. The air rushes out with considerable force from the periphery of the wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Between the vacuum chamber and the pneumatic tube, which is <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> <measure n="9inches" type="distance">nine inches</measure> high, by <measure n="2feet" type="distance">2 feet</measure> <measure n="6inches" type="distance">6 inches</measure> in breadth, and a transverse section of which resembles that of the <rs>Thames Tunnel</rs>, there are fitted valves with hand levers for opening and shutting them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>These may be said to comprise the whole of the motive and propelling agencies of the pneumatic system. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> The tube has been laid down in <placeName reg="Batter sea">Batter sea</placeName> Fields, in such a manner as to test severely the practicability of the scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It has several very sharp curves and sleep gradients throughout its length, and is socket-jointed, so as to leave its interior, which is just as it came from the sand, free from obstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The carriages are <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> in length, of <rs n="sheet iron" type="product">sheet iron</rs>, and each runs upon <num value="4">four</num> cast-iron wheels of <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The rails &mdash; so to speak &mdash; are cast in the bottoms of the tubes, and require, therefore, no <q>&#x0022;laying&#x0022;</q> but that which the setting of the tubes themselves gives them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>A few strips of vulcanized India-rubber screwed round the circumference of the fore end of the carriage constitute the piston.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>This, however, by no means closely fits the tube.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>In fact, there is fully <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".125">eighths</num> of an inch clear between the exterior of the piston and the interior of the tube. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> There is no friction, therefore; and, singular to say, the leakage of air does not interfere with the speed of transit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>This can only be accounted for by the large end area which the carriages have, in comparison with the small area of leakage space and the comparatively low vacuum required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>On wednesday last the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experiment made was by loading a carriage with <num value="1">one</num> ton of cement in bags, and entering it into the open end of the tube.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Upon a given signal the engineer to the company caused the starting valve to be opened, the water barometer showing a column of <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure> in height, and the disc running at the rate of <num value="150">150</num> revolutions per minute. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> In <measure n="50seconds" type="date">fifty seconds</measure> after, the carriage with its contents found its way into the engine house, through a door at the end of the tube, which it forced open, and then ran forward on rails to a butt placed to stop its progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Next <num value="2">two</num> tons weight were placed in <num value="1">one</num> of the carriages, and its transit occupied <measure n="80seconds" type="date">eighty seconds</measure>, under similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The vacuum was now lowered until the barometer gauge showed <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> of water only, and a living passenger, in the shape of a not very handsome dog, was placed with <num value="1">one</num> ton weight of dead stock, in a carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The signal was made by the workmen at the open end of the tube, the communicating valve was opened, and in <num value="1">one</num> minute and <num value="0.5">a half</num> the carriage and its <num value="4">four</num>-legged guard were in the engine-house, the latter apparently not at all the worse for the exhausting process to which he had been subjected. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/> When the <rs>Resolute</rs> went on the expedition which resulted in the loss of her boat's crew at <placeName reg="Mathias Point, King George, Virginia" key="tgn,2496456">Mathias' Point</placeName>, her object, it is now well understood, was, after making a reconnaissance, to return to the <rs type="place">Navy Yard</rs> and lead an expedition down the river, to test, if not to demolish, the <orgName n="Confederate Battery" type="battery">Confederate batteries</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Your latest intelligence shows you that this expedition did actually proceed according to the programme, and being well equipped and well officered, it was regarded as of the most formidable character &mdash; so formidable, indeed, as to inspire officers at the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs> with a confidence which tempted them to announce to their friends, very positively, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, that Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> and <placeName reg="Mathias Point, King George, Virginia" key="tgn,2496456">Mathias' Point</placeName> had been taken beyond a peradventure, and that their batteries were actually in the possession of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>It is said that the plan was to land the men at <num value="2">two</num> points, and by a vigorous advance before dawn, to surprise the batteries and take them in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>It now appears that this attractive programme was relinquished for the occasion, and another substituted, in consequence of the discovery, by the <rs>Resolute</rs>, of the nest of sharp-shooters at <placeName reg="Mathias Point, King George, Virginia" key="tgn,2496456">Mathias' Point</placeName>, and of the long range of the <name>Aquia</name> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> guns, which, commanding the river from shore to shore, threatened to cut off the expedition altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Those batteries, it is confidently asserted, must and shall be taken; and the fleet which, we are told, is even now being fitted out, will doubtless embrace the landing of considerable bodies of troops, with the object of clearing out the batteries and spiking the guns.
