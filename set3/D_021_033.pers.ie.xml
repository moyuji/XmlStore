<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> We are now masters of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We have a magnificent army of <num value="700000">700,000</num> men, including an ordnance force which, if properly employed, will prove the justice of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s well known saying, that <q>&#x0022;Heaven is on the side of the heaviest artillery,&#x0022;</q> and a <orgName n="Cavalry Corps" type="corps">cavalry corps</orgName> of <num value="50000">50,000</num> men composed of as fine material as any in the world, the whole recently reorganized in respect to its field and line officers in a manner to render it equal to the emergencies of the most trying campaigns.--We have a navy which, in the number of vessels and sailors daily added to it, is rapidly advancing to the same state of strength and efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Now, all that is wanted is energetic and vigorous action on the part of Congress to obtain from this immense development of military and naval strength the speedy results that are expected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> To accomplish the great object which the nation has in view &mdash; of reconstructing the <rs>Union</rs> as it stood before this rebellion &mdash; it becomes a political necessity and a duty on the part of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who has already won the admiration and applause of the country by the conscientious and conservative course he has pursued, to proclaim, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great victory obtained by on arms, that it is his determination and that of his administration to maintain the constitutional rights of every State inviolate, and on the return of the rebels to their allegiance to guarantee to them their rights as citizens in the <name>States</name> in which they now exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Such a proclamation, following close on the heels of a great victory, will prove that the war has not been undertaken from vindictiveness or a thirst of power, as <name>English</name> politicians pretend, and that the position of this country is <num value="1">one</num> of great strength and conservatism, important alike to the cause of good Government and to the interests of republicanism throughout the world. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> If it were not fully demonstrated by advices from the <rs>South</rs> that the <rs>Confederates</rs> are only partially provided with long-range muskets, there would not be much room for doubt upon the point, from the fact that the <rs>English</rs> papers state that, after the stoppage of the exportation of arms to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, some of the manufacturers, who were filling <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> orders, applied to the <rs>British</rs> authorities to take the arms they had on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In reply, specimens were asked for, and, upon examination and trial, they were found to be of most inferior make, and many of the so-called <q>&#x0022;rifles&#x0022;</q> were merely grooved a few inches from the muzzle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> It is found in practice that grooving the smooth-bore <placeName reg="Springfield, Clark, Ohio" key="tgn,7014533">Springfield</placeName> musket greatly increases the danger of bursting the barrel, &#x0026;c., and in this view <persName n="Dahlgren,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> stated, at the beginning of the war, that even cannon would not well bear grooving, unless cast specially for that purpose. </p> </div4>

<head>A dangerous crisis at hand.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> An officer from <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> states that he visited <placeName reg="Columbus, Franklin, Ohio" key="tgn,7013645">Columbus</placeName> lately under a flag of truce, and had an interview with <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Polk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> and others, who expressed a firm reliance upon aid from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> at an early day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> Colonel In my note of the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="3">3d inst.</day></dateStruct> I gave you a brief account of the attack made that day upon our position by the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> Advancing along the turnpike with a heavy column composed of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, numbering, at a sale estimate, from <num value="6000">six</num> to <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> men, he drove in our advanced pickets at an early hour in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time> he encountered the main body of the advanced guard rein forced to about <num value="100">one hundred</num> strong and posted on the right side of the turnpike <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> from out lines by <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="default:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="12GARegiment">12th Georgia regiment</orgName>, who took command in person. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> You will find this position designated upon the accompanying map by the capitis letter <q> &#x0022;E&#x0022;</q> It is but justice to this superior officer, and to the gallant band whose movements he directed, to say that it would not have been possible for so small a force to have been more skillfully handled, or to have exhibited more obstinate courage in the face of numbers so overwhelming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>They held the column of the enemy in check for nearly an hour, pouring into the head of it a galling fire, not with drawing until <num value="6">six</num> pieces of artillery had opened briskly upon them, and full battalions of infantry were on flanking them on the right, and then retiring in such order, and taking such advantage of the ground, as to reach our camp with but a trifling loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>To this brilliant skirmish, in which <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had his horse killed under him, is doubtless to be ascribed, in a measure, the exhilarated spirit manifested by our troops during the remainder of the day. Before taking leave of it, and referring to former dispatches, I would beg once again to direct to <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> the special attention of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>, not simply for this peculiarly brilliant service, but for his gallant and efficient conduct throughout the entire engagement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> So soon as it had become apparent that the enemy contemplated a systematic attack upon our camp, I disposed of my entire force to meet it. To convey a correct idea, not simply of that disposition, but of the subsequent action, I must pray reference to the accompanying map, for which I am indebted to <persName n="Barton,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Barton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</roleName> <surname>Barton</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3ARRegiment">3d Arkansas regiment</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> As I have already reported to you, our position is not by nature a commanding <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The causes of its weakness are the necessity of defending extended lines on our front (not less than a mile) and on our flanks, and the fact that there are points in our rear which, in the possession of an enemy, might give us great trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The works essential to our safety were in progress of construction at the time of the attack, but were only partially completed, nothing whatever having been done to strengthen our right flauk or our rear I am happy to say that during the last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, through the indefatigable efforts of <persName n="Barton,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Barton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut. Colonel</roleName> <surname>Barton</surname></persName>, in immediate charge of the works, backed by the cheerful labor of the men, we are already in condition to defy an approach from any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Not doubting that the attack upon us had been, to some extent, invited by our commencing to fortify ourselves against it, and fearing that the enemy might have been fully advised of our weak points, until he had actually begun his retreat, my mind could not dispossess itself of the idea that he had sent another column over the mountains to turn our right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>To prepare for this danger, I held the <orgName type="regiment" key="1GARegiment">1st Georgia regiment</orgName>, so far as that could be done, in reserve for what I apprehended would be a desperate struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>I also sent expresses to <persName n="Baldwin,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Baldwin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>, whom I had previously ordered to the top of the <rs type="place">Alleghany Ridge</rs>, directing him to move the <orgName type="regiment" key="52VARegiment">52d Virginia regiment</orgName> as rapidly down as possible, and to fall upon the rear of the enemy should he undertake to fall upon ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>That gallant regiment responded, as I have learned, most heartily to the call, and when halted upon the road by the tidings that the day had already been won, despite of its not-to-be-doubted patriotism, could not entirely conceal its chagrin. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> The <num value="2">two</num> brigades in this camp, weakened by the absence of the several corps on detached service (he <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> having been reduced from this cause and from sickness to scarce <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its legitimate number) I posted in the following order: The <orgName type="regiment" key="1GARegiment">1st Georgia regiment</orgName> upon our extreme right, under command of <persName n="Thomoson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Thomoson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Thomoson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ramsey,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Ramsey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ramsey</surname></persName> (he field officer of the day) having been cut off from us by the enemy while discharging his duty upon the road; next to it was placed the <orgName type="regiment" key="12GARegiment">12th Georgia regiment</orgName>--both of these regiments designed for the immediate command of <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>This detachment marched in gallant style, under the enemy's fire, to the position as signed it in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The troops on this wing which, from the character of the ground were widely disparted, fell under the general command of <persName n="Rust,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Rust,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Rust</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3ARRegiment">3d Arkansas regiment</orgName>, and consisted of his own command, the <orgName type="regiment" key="31VAVolunteer">31st Virginia volunteers</orgName>, <persName n="Jackson,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,H.,R.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and the battalion of <persName n="Hansborough,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Hansborough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hansborough</surname></persName>, commanded, in his absence on account of sickness, by <persName n="Robertson,senior-Captain,J.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="default:Robertson,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="senior-Captain">senior Captain</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>These guns were under the immediate charge of <persName n="Anderson,Captain,P.,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="default:Anderson,P.,B.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, and the zeal, skill, and determination of that officer, leave no doubt that they would have done great execution had the enemy ventured to call them into action. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The places occupied by these various corps you will find specified upon the map. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> Our forces were all in position ween, at about <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time>, the enemy opened a heavy fire from <num value="6">six</num> (<num value="6">6</num>) pieces of different calibre, placed in a field upon the right band side (to them) of the turnpike road, and bearing upon our front and centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>This number was subsequently increased by <num value="2">two</num> other pieces, placed on the opposite side of the turnpike, <num value="1">one</num> near it and the other upon the rise of the hill, This fire (of round shot, spherical case, shell, end occasionally upon our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, of canister,) was continued with extraordinary rabidity, and without intermission, for upwards of <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, the <num value="8">eight</num> guns constituting the well known field batteries of How and of <persName n="Loomis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Loomis,nomatch:0"><surname>Loomis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The bill occupied by Col <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Taliaferro,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,nomatch:0"><surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, invitingly expected to all of these batteries, received the greater share of their attention, and, but for the protection afforded by the ditch and embankment running along the brow, and constructed under the immediate supervision of <persName n="Taliaferro,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName> himself, we should doubtless have had inflicted upon us a very severe loss indeed, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> This fire was returned with great energy, and, as the result has proved, with signal effect, by the guns of <persName n="Shumaker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Shumaker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shumaker</surname></persName> and <persName n="Rice,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="nearbymention:Rice,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Rice</surname></persName>, and by <num value="1">one</num> piece detached from <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Anderson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,P.,B.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> and placed upon the hill occupied by <persName n="Jackson,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,H.,R.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>From the fact that the rified gun of <persName n="Shumaker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Shumaker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shumaker</surname></persName> soon became useless to us, (for the cause of this great misfortune see his own report, addressed to myself,) at no time could we bring more than <num value="5">five</num> pieces into action to return the fire of the enemy's <num value="8">eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Yet that fire was returned, and that with so much spirit and energy as to make this <q>&#x0022;artillery duel&#x0022;</q> indeed peculiarly interesting, by the character of the field and its mountain surroundings, ever memorable by those who beheld it. That the casualties among our cannoneers should have been so few, is a subject of sincere congratulation, and is very much ascribable to the sound judgment of <persName n="Shumaker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Shumaker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shumaker</surname></persName>, who repeatedly changed the position of his guns when those of the enemy had obtained his range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>For a minuter description of the action in this, its most striking phase, I take great pleasure in referring to the report of that consummately cool and skillful officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>From it you will learn why it was that our pieces, at the close of the <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> interchange of fire, were temporarily withdrawn, <unclear>indu nur</unclear> friends upon our extreme left, and evidently the enemy, to suppose that they had been silenced. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> At about <time value="9:30">half past 9</time>, a strong column of infantry was seen to move towards our left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Having crossed the to called river (in fact, a shallow stream o. about <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure> in width,) near the point designated on the map by the capital letter <q>&#x0022;a&#x0022;</q> it undertook to turn our position in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Soon, however, it encountered a portion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3ARRegiment">3d Arkansas regiment</orgName>, which drove it precipitately back with a destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The enemy subsequently turned <num value="2">two</num> of his pieces upon this position of our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, pouring out shell and cannister in large volumes, but fortunately, on account of the protection afforded by the works, with but little execution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> Simultaneously with this movement towards our left, another column of infantry ascended the wooded hill before our <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>, at the point designated upon the map by the capital letter <q>&#x0022;B.&#x0022;</q> Having become, <unclear></unclear> involved a slight skirmish with <num value="1">one</num> of our <orgName n="Picket Guards" type="guards">picket guards</orgName>, it was immediately and strongly reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Subsequently to the repulse of the column from ourself flank, it proceeded in the same general direction, ascending the hill a the point designated by the letter <q>&#x0022;C,&#x0022;</q> and dwelling the force which how began to threaten seriously our front and right to some <num value="4000">4,000</num> men. They moved along the side of the hill, opening upon our lines a desultory fire of rifle musketry, which was continued until the close of the action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>So soon as the designs of this column were fully developed, I ordered the <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> <unclear></unclear> regiment to take position near the stream, where a small detachment of it, under <persName n="Dawson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Dawson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Dawson</surname></persName>, had already been posted, with instructions to engage the enemy whenever he should attempt to cross From the fact that this movement was made in full face of largely superior numbers, and with a superior weapon, and protected by cover of the forest, it was made with an alacrity and a regularity which deserve high commendation, as does also the cool determination with which this command, protecting <unclear></unclear> as best it might against the enemy's the, received it, but returned scarce a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Not long there after, I ordered <persName n="Shumaker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Shumaker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shumaker</surname></persName> to open upon the same column, directing his fire to where he supposed the head of it to be Tois he promptly aid with <num value="2">two</num> pieces, and so effectively, had in a short time the <unclear>an tamable</unclear> evidences of their rout became apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Distinctly could their officers be Heard, with words of mingled command, remonstrance, and entreaty, attempting to rally their battalions into line, and to bring them to the charge; but they could not be induced to re form their broken ranks, for to emerge from the cover of the woods, in the direction of our fire Rapidly and in disorder they returned into the turnpike, and soon thereafter the entire force of the enemy, artillery, infantry, and <unclear>cavalry</unclear> <unclear>retreand</unclear> in confusion along the road and adjacent heaving behind them, at different points, numbers of their <unclear></unclear> guns, knapsacks, canteens, etc., etc. Among other trophies taken were a stand of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <unclear></unclear> which are held subject to the order of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> This engagement lasted from <time value="7am">seven in the morning</time> to <time value="2:30oclock">half-past 2 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, at which time the enemy, who had come with artillery to bombard and demoralize us, with infantry to storm our camp, with cavalry to rout and destroy us, and with <hi rend="italics"><measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> cooked rations</hi> in his haversack, to prosecute a rapid march either towards <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> or towards <placeName key="tgn,2118671" n="1.000 14" reg="huntersville, pocahontas, west virginia">Huntersville</placeName>, was in precipitate retreat back to his <placeName reg="Cheat Mountain, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,2234058">Cheat Mountain</placeName> fastness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>And it is certainly a matter not unworthy of mention, that while his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> insolent advances were received with defiant cheers, running from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other of our line, he was permitted to take his departure under the simple reports of our pieces, firing upon him so long as he continued within their range The relative weakness of our force, and the entire absence of cavalry, prevented our pursuing him, and thereby realizing the legitimate trail a of our triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>His loss in killed and wounded is estimated at from <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="300">three hundred</num>--among them an officer of superior rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Our own, I am happy to say, was very inconsiderable, not exceeding <num value="50">fifty</num> in also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>This most gratifying result is to be astarboard, in a great degree, to the remarkable coolness of regimental and company officers, who never seemed for a moment to loss their presence of mind, never allowed their men unnecessarily to expose themselves, and profited by every advantage of ground and position, to shield them from danger. </p>

<head>Our treatment of prisoners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> The protest we made a few days ago against the <rs type="place">Prison</rs> Inspecting Committee, insolently appointed on a mission of espionage to the <rs>South</rs> by the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>, has met the universal endorsement of the <rs>Southern</rs> press and public; and the most lively satisfaction is everywhere expressed at the prompt determination of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities to refuse admission within our lines to the <rs>Commissioners</rs> selected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> What right have these people to complain of any treatment their prisoners are receiving at our hands, supposing it to be ever so barbarous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>With what decency can they ask permission to look into the condition of our prisons or their inmates?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Those prisoners came into our country in their own wrong, on the most brutal and savage errand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>They came upon our territory, to the doors of our homes, to shoot down our people, to outrage our women, to plunder our property, and to excite our slaves to insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They came to let local all the furies upon our heads, and to roam and run riot with fire and faggot over the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>We caught the savage intruders in the act. We should have been justified in putting them instantly to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>We should have executed a righteous vengeance upon them, if we had, after the manner of the aboriginal ravages of the forest, tied them to stakes, and, amid dances and rejoicing, put them by slow and excruciating torture to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They chose to outlaw us from the pale of humanity, and avowed their purpose to deal with us as infamous persons whose existence was a curse to the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>They repudiated the thought of allowing us the amenities of civilized warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>They banished humanity and <name>Christian</name> moderation from their purposes, and came to exterminate us as beasts and brutes of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>All this was before we had caught their prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> We had a right to take them at their own word, and, if we were to encounter the treatment and fate of outlaws, to retort upon them the desperate resistance usual with <hi rend="italics">hostess human generis</hi> They were <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, their men alone came against us, and our wives and children were to meet a common fate with ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>They came in their pride, expecting to execute upon us the ferocious intentions with which they set out. They were driven back, and many of them, less swift of foot than the rest, fell into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>We captured them by <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>There was no fate our ingenuity and just anger could have invented which would have been too severe for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>We might have hoisted the black flag of the pirate and outlaw, and refused all quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>We might have maimed and left them lying upon the ground, to become a living prey to wolves and buzzards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>We might, in mock humanity, have washed their wounds with vitriol, and poulticed them with pepper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>We might have pinched their flesh with hot frons, and practiced upon them those very cruelties which their lying tongues had so often accused us of visiting upon our slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>We might have buried them alive, and, with a refinement of savagery, have inserted tubes from the surface, and by protracting respiration, protracted the awful fate to which we thus consigned them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> But none of these things did we do. We returned good for evil, we chose the part of good Samaritans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>We gathered together their wounded and sick in hospitals, and we decently buried their dead when their defeated comrades had not the humanity and decency to ask to bury them themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Their Government, with unexampled brutality, had declared all medicines contraband of war, and prohibited their introduction within our boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Notwithstanding this infamous decree, we administered to them, of our scanty supplies, insufficient for our own sick, that which their own Government thus denied them, though costing us <num value="4">four</num> prices, and in all respects did we care for them as we cared for the brave sick and wounded who had been fighting for our liberty and security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The lives of our own sick and wounded soldiers were very precious in our sight, and their comfort and recovery were very near to our hearts; but not even these cherished men received a kindlier attention, than those who had come to slay, violate, rob, ruin, and exterminate us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Since the period when <num value="1000">thousands</num> of these hired emissaries fell into our hands, it has suited the factious of the enemy to assume a less savage tone towards our cause and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The <q> &#x0022;pirates,&#x0022;</q> taken on our privateers, which they would have ignominiously hung up by the neck amid the shouts of an exultant mob, have gradually been metamorphosed into <q> &#x0022;prisoners&#x0022;</q> of war, and, in order to extricate their own prisoners among us from the fate which they know we could make as severe as we desired, they are willing to exchange man for man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> That measure we will consent to; but when, with hypocritical professions of philanthropy and affected solicitude for soldiers of whom their cold-hearted race refused to bury the dead, they would send deputations to confer with their prisoners and to spy out our resources and defenses, it is proper that we should rebuke them by a prompt and contemptuous refusal of their command. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The demands of the crisis.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> The South should henceforth sternly set her face against the natural disposition to look for assistance from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and to expect others to do for us what we ought to do for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>That the <rs>Western</rs> nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will, sooner or later, open the blockade, we have not now, any more than we have ever had, a shadow of a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>But great bodies proverbially move slowly, and it would be unreasonable to expect prudent and sagacious Governments, whatever their interests or sympathies, to involve themselves in the consequence of an opening of the blockade, without such a guarantee of our capacity to maintain our independence as only our own acts can give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>They wait for us; if we wait for them, it will induce a degree or lethargy and security among ourselves which will lead to disaster, and render even more distant and doubtful the period of our recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>We should not allow ourselves to be lulled to false security by the increasing apprehensions expressed by the <rs>Northern</rs> press of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention on behalf of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>That there is ground for these apprehensions, we fully believe; but, to make them certain, we must bestir ourselves, and be prepared at least to maintain our own in the present struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>We are aware that there is no abatement of zeal among our people, and that the flame of patriotism burns among the masses with a steady and increasing light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But our legislators and Congressional representatives must act speedily in providing for the military defence of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Instead of permitting any diminution of our forces on the frontier, already inferior to the enemy in everything but courage, constancy, and virtue, we should provide for a large and immediate increase of our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>In this connexion, the measure of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance is that which concerns the re-enlistment of volunteers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> This momentous question is <num value="1">one</num> which after all, must depend upon the patriotism of the volunteers themselves, though the <name>Legislature</name> and Congress may, by wise action, greatly facilitate that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>However we may supply a diminution of numbers from this source, it is unquestionably true that we </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> <unclear></unclear> the brave men who have for nearly a year to heroically and successfully defended the fire sides and the homes of the <rs>South</rs> from invasion and defilement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>We can well understand that the volunteers have had severe trials of their patience and their temper, not only in the great hardships which they have undergone, and the monotonous inaction of camp life, but in the intense selfishness which has been manifested by greedy speculators who have not only refrained from aiding the <rs>Southern</rs> cause in any way, either in person or by contribution, but have greedily and basely speculated upon the wants of those, who were defending their homes and property at the peril of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It is hard for the bravest men to toil on amid such discouragements as this, imagining, perhaps, that the whole country, as well as these sharpers, are looking with indifference upon their fate, and only using the war as an engine for the aggrandizement of their individual fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Such a supposition would, however, do great injustice to the masses of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It is only a certain class, greedy harpies, who are to be found in every country, and who are a disgrace to humanity, who speculate upon the necessities of the whole community as well as the soldiery, and are indifferent to their sufferings, their trials, and their glories.--It may at least be said of the helpless class, of the mothers, wives, and daughters of the <rs>South</rs>, who have labored incessantly for the comfort of the soldiers since the beginning of the war, who have nursed them in sickness, and provided by their cheerful and patient industry for the clothing of the volunteers, that they at least are free from the imputation of selfishness, and that they deserve to be defended from the licentious and brutal invaders who have threatened to bring upon every Southern home a fate which is more horrible than death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>We feel sure that, were their physical power equal to their disinterested patriotism, an army of women might be organized in the <rs>South</rs> who would never permit the ruthless invader to advance another foot upon Southern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Let our brave volunteers set off the unselfish love of country of that vast majority of the community, who have no means of protecting themselves, against the greedy rapacity of speculators and birds of prey, and then decide which class should be permitted to influence their future action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> In regard to the inaction entailed upon our armies by a defensive policy, it ought to be recollected that, trying as it is to the spirit of an ardent and chivalric soldiery, it has at all events thus far preserved our independence and saved our soil from subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>This has been the glorious result of that virtue of patience and endurance which is even more difficult than active courage, and which has thus far shed a <unclear></unclear> upon Southern character not interior to that which has been achieved by their matchless prowess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Our enemies, as well as the world at large, have been sorely disappointed in the exhibition of this quality by the soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>They had predicted that they would make an impetuous rush in battle, and make for a time a great dash and display, but that they would soon become demoralized by inaction, and demonstrate an utter want of patience and stability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>On the contrary, our men have hitherto shown a fortitude equal to their courage, and have patiently submitted to privations and delays more harassing than the peris of the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>We cannot believe that at the critical juncture now approaching they will fulfill the malicious expectations of their enemies, and permit the <rs>Southern</rs> cause to perish on the very banks of <persName n="Jordan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="mostcommon:Jordan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jordan</surname></persName>, in sight of the promised land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>For that cause is literally in sight of all that they have been fighting and suffering for and no <num value="1">one</num> with any capacity of reason pretends that the war can be protracted beyond the end of the present year, if our armies still stand to their colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>All that they have fought for a nearly achieved; the exchequer of <unclear>the</unclear> is exhausted, its patience is nearly <unclear>ken</unclear> down; and the great Powers of <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Western Europe</placeName> will not much longer brook the inability of the <rs>North</rs> to open the ports of the <rs>South</rs> to the commercial world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>A little more patience in well doing and the end is achieved, and they by whom it is achieved will return permanently to homes which they have made independent and happy, but which will again be endangered and perhaps destroyed, just on the verge of glorious redemption, if our tried and heroic armies take their hands from the plough of battle. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> My last letter was written after a day of considerable excitement, and I really looked for the attack of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> upon the works about <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> during the week; but a fortunate chance has driven them away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>I call it a chance, for it certainly did not result from any preconceived design on the part of our military commanders. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>They have suggested to us the only proper and efficient use to be made of the dock, and <num value="1">one</num> which, no doubt, will be soon effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It is capable to support a battery of heavy guns, and can be in a short time made stronger and more formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>And I can further derive this benefit from the near approach of the enemy, that it has infused some more energy into our authorities here; they have been diligent in completing the batteries on the river, opposite <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName>, and the <num value="1">one</num> on <placeName reg="Hutchinson's Island, Colleton, South Carolina" key="tgn,2408479">Hutchinson's Island</placeName>, just below this city, and have put <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName> in a condition to withstand a siege, which should have been done long since. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Great loss may be entailed upon us, since, though no advantage would accrue to the enemy, their malice might suggest the punishment of the rebellious city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>I mention this now not intending to form any opinion of the justice of the judgment, but merely incidentally to remark that much of the <hi rend="italics">panic</hi> which prevailed last <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, and of the general feeling of insecurity, originates with this want of confidence in the superior officer at this post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>At this time, when the enemy knocks at our very gates, and has approached in full view of the city, energy, daring, and consummate skill are absolutely necessary in the conduct of the defence, and without these qualifications the appointees of the <rs>Government</rs> will certainly fall to receive the support of the community, and tend to weaken the hold which the <name>Administration</name> has upon the affections of the people. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch</hi> In your paper of the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="16">16th instant</day></dateStruct> you have published the rules adopted by the <rs>Sequestration Commissioners</rs> for the government of cases that may be presented before them by claimants under the sequestration act; and it really seems to me that these commissioners have taxed their ingenuity to prescribe rules to prevent the ends of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The commissioners require that every claim shall be in roll form, the sheets to be connected at the margin, <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> wide, on the left hand, &#x0026;c. How obscure persons in the country can comply with this rule, I cannot tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>They then require that the petition shall be divided into paragraphs, numbered consecutively; each paragraph to contain a separate and distinct allegation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>These commissioners are acting as chancellors, and all that they should require of claimants is a full, plain, and substantial statement of their demands, verified by affidavits I cannot see the necessity of, nor does the sequestration act contemplate that claimants should be required to give <num value="20">twenty</num> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>It prescribes that no lawyer shall be permitted to practice before this <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">board of commissioners</orgName> unless he has been admitted to practice before the highest court in the <rs>State</rs>.
