<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The pressure caused by the fall of gold and the failure of mercantile houses turns the attention of the <rs>Northern</rs> public to the actual condition of the country, its debt, resources, currency and taxes, and the future prospect of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>What the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName></hi> thinks on this subject is interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>There is danger, it thinks; because when the revulsion comes it will find the majority unprepared, and the general suffering thereby greatly increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>With a view of preparing the thoughtful reader for the crisis, and lessening the common damage when it comes, it offers some suggestions relating to the financial future: </p> 
<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>A financial crash itself is not the worst possible termination to an inflation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>As the danger of breaking a limb is to the probability of a chronic disease, so is a financial crash as compared to the wasting inanition of a gradual collapse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2">2</num>. The loss of real or fancied accumulations is not serious when it does not impair the capacity of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The great secret of the marvelous elasticity which the people of this country have shown in recovering from certain depressions of business is to be found in this fact: that the great majority are qualified for some class of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>In this country, the distinction of classes is less strongly marked, and success dignifies any calling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>It is time that the hours of labor in the future are to be lengthened greatly by the pressure of taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>If the national debt is assumed by this generation, at least <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> per day will be added to every man's toil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>But while unoccupied land is abundant, none need suffer for life's necessaries who are disposed to eat their bread in the sweat of their faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Besides, the tax on labor must, ere long, be lightened by a change in the style of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>This may be done without abridging personal or social comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>A large part of the expenditure of families, who are raised above the pressure of immediate want, is for mere display.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The necessity which limits the gratification of this vanity will not prove an unmitigated evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The avenues to temptation have been greatly multiplied by the effort to maintain an appearance of grandeur without the affluence with which it is intended to represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Much of this will, of necessity, be swept away, and the people be taught the comfort of simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3">3</num>. The great object for all to keep before them, in view of the probable future, is freedom from entangled engagements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The crash or collapse must come, but the consequent shrinking of every man's nominal capital is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/><num value="1">One</num> of the greatest mysteries to those who have congratulated themselves on their accumulated fortunes will be, what has become of their supposed wealth.--They have succeeded in the majority of their speculations; they have met with no direct losses; and yet they cannot lay their hands upon the means they thought were so indisputably their own. The shrinking of value after a financial inflation leaves no record of its expunging process, and is certain to disappoint the hopes even of the cautious and prudent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Debts will not shrink with the means of discharging them, and many a man who might save a snug capital from the wreck, if he were not thus fettered, will come out of the trial with nothing about him but the burden of obligation.
