<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> <num value="2">Two</num> remarkable articles, upon the &#x0022;Physical Resources of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>&#x0022; and &#x0022;The Situation, Past and Present,&#x0022; were published, several days since, in the <orgName n="Richmond Whig" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>As they seem to be the result of profound study, and are very encouraging, we propose to give a summary of their contents, having no room to publish them <hi rend="italics">in extenso.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> The belief has been very widely entertained that the arms bearing population of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>This belief &mdash; common to us and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--has had the effect of depressing our people and stimulating the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>It is utterly erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The materials of which armies are composed exist around us in sufficient abundance not only to keep up our force to its present standard, but to enlarge it beyond what it has ever been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>This is proved by comparing <hi rend="italics">data</hi> derived from the statistics afforded by the census of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, with an estimate of losses and diminution of resources sufficiently large to cover all decrease in the supply of arms-bearing men.--For example: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> The white male population of all the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, leaving out <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, was, in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, a fraction less than <num value="2800000">2,800,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Of this male population, a fraction less than <num value="1300000">1,300,000</num> were between the ages of <num value="17">seventeen</num> and <num value="50">fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The persons who have arrived at the age of <num value="17">seventeen</num> since <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> are computed at a fraction above <num value="330000">330,000</num>--a moderate computation we <hi rend="italics">think.</hi> Add these numbers together, and we have, in round numbers, <num value="1630000">1,630,000</num> fighting men. Allowing <num value="200000">200,000</num> for the average <hi rend="italics">natural</hi> mortality of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and we still have <num value="1430000">1,430,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>But a great deal of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is in the hands of the enemy It is computed that this occupation deprives us of <num value="340000">340,000</num> men (in round numbers) between the ages of <num value="17">seventeen</num> and <num value="50">fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>These are to be deducted, and they leave <num value="1090000">1,090,000</num>--say, in round numbers, <num value="1100000">1,100,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>If these are under estimates, they may be supplied by troops from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and refugees from those portions of the other States under <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> domination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> A farther deduction must be made for the casualties that have resulted either in death or disability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>This is done by estimating the losses in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,D.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> for the last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Putting it at <num value="35000">35,000</num>--which is greatly above the truth &mdash; and allowing <num value="5000">5,000</num> for dead and <num value="5000">5,000</num> for permanently disabled, we have <num value="10000">10,000</num> for that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Making the same allowance for the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, we have <num value="20000">20,000</num> for the <num value="2">two</num> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>It is fair to make the same allowance for all the rest of the forces, so that the entire disabling casualties amount to <num value="30000">30,000</num>, --To these add <num value="0.5">fifty per cent.</num> for mortality peculiar to camps--<num value="45000">45,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The whole loss then may be computed at <num value="75000">75,000</num> men for this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But it has been much heavier this year than it was during the other <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the war. It is fair to say that in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, when there was little fighting, the loss was <num value="30000">30,000</num>; in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, <num value="60000">60,000</num> each &mdash; so that the whole loss from disease and battle has been <num value="225000">225,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Add to this <num value="50000">50,000</num> for prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Total, <num value="275000">275,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Take this <num value="1100000">1,100,000</num>, and we have <num value="825000">825,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Allowing <num value="100000">100,000</num> for exempts and details, and there is still a fighting population of <num value="725000">725,000</num> men ! Allowing <num value="1">one</num> out of every <num value="3">three</num> for details, and we still have <num value="480000">480,000</num> men; more than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> ever had, and enough, if embodied, to drive every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> out of the country in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, and keep them out. We have not followed the numbers of our author fully, because he aims at exactness, while, we use only round numbers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> Such we believe to be very nearly a true statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>There can be but <num value="1">one</num> thing wanted to secure undoubted success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>That <num value="1">one</num> thing is the spirit of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>If they will use the advantages they have their triumph is certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>But if the <hi rend="italics">spirit</hi> is gone, <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of soldiers, &#x0022;armed all in proof,&#x0022; will do no good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>We are pretty confident that that time has not arrived as yet. Looking at the actual situation, we are far from being discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>We hold, at this moment, far more territory than we did this time last year &mdash; a proof that, upon summing up the whole, the campaign has been greatly in our favor.
