<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>He seemed to be a lingering relic of the dynasty which so long tyrannized over the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The gentleman had charged that he (<persName n="Dunn,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Dunn,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dunn</surname></persName>) had abandoned the faith and belief that the white men of the <rs>North</rs> can crush out the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>At the time when the rebellion broke out he (<persName n="Dunn,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Dunn,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dunn</surname></persName>) was opposed to the employment of negro soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>He then thought there was a loyal sentiment among the whites of the <rs>South</rs> which would make itself efficient in the way. This was not so. He had made another discovery, namely, that men with black skins had white hearts, and loyal hearts; if they are willing to risk their lives for the cause in which they have so deep an interest, he saw no reason why they should not take part in the fight. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The gentleman from <placeName reg="Kentucky, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> spoke about a loyal black <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> being exchanged for a rebel white <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, a proceeding which the gentleman condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The loyal black was not only equal, but superior to the white traitor fighting against his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>He had a son fighting on the right side, and he would prefer that this son should be saved by true loyal black men, than go to his grave beneath the stroke of a white traitor. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>It was an assertion in favor of the present bill about which gentlemen, as in the days of chivalry, might break a lance, but it was no argument becoming them for serious consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> In his late great speech, <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> says: &#x0022;Many States and peoples ones separated have become united through the course of ages through natural causes, and without conquest; But I remember a single instance only, in history, of States or people once united and speaking the same language, who have been forced permanently asunder by civil strife or war, unless they were separated by distance or vast natural boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>And who now, <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> or <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, looking into history, shall say that because of civil war the union of these States is impossible ? War, indeed, while it lasts, is disunion, and, if it lasts long enough, will be final and eternal separation <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and anarchy and despotism afterwards.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> The exception to the general rule, which <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> lays down, is, doubtless, <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, the people of which speak all the same language, and yet are separated into a score of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It is obvious why he selected this case to make an exception of it. It is the strongest in point for those who believe that secession is inevitable, and has often been used as an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It could be gotten rid of in no other way than by shoving it aside into a limbo of exceptions, where it might be left to sleep in oblivion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>But it will not thus be passed over. --The case of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> is strictly analogous to the case of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It was originally composed of a number of small principalities each independent of the other, and managing its own internal affairs in its own way, while all acknowledged a sort of allegiance to the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> war and the peace of <placeName key="tgn,7012772" n="1.000 1" reg="rhine-westphalia">Westphalia</placeName> broke up this arrangement, and separate kingdoms grew up in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, who ever since have been negotiating and fighting with each other as independently as <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> might have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/><placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, however, is not the only example.
