<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> It is impossible to repress feelings of mortification at the tardiness manifested by the non- combatants and exempts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in contributing to the <rs>Jackson Monument Fund</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>We cannot say we are surprised that the principal contributions come from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The army contains the cream and essence of the chivalry and generosity of this land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/><persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName> was the embodiment of the military soul of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>He had no characteristic in common with men whose souls are absorbed in the pursuit of gain, and who are of the earth, earthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>In the canker of a long peace, and the corroding influences of commerce, he might have lived and died unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>He was a person of that rare quality, simplicity of character, of unselfishness so remarkable that he has been known to rise from his bed at night and remove part of his scanty covering to shelter a sleeping subaltern from the wintry cold; of humility so profound that he blushed like a child when made the object of extraordinary observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>He never thought even of glory, much less of gold.--That wonderful devotion to his country, and that magnificent valor and energy which gave him a name among the immortals, were never soiled by the taint of sordid calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Duty was his polar star &mdash; duty to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man &mdash; and whether it led him over smooth or stormy seas, was a thing to him of complete indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>No clouds but those which hid that star from his gaze had terrors for his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The huge billows that confronted him, the winds that howled his destruction, were things at which he smiled, so long as the star of duty shone upon his path. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> It is impossible that speculators and extortioners, that selfish and pusillanimous souls, should feel, or practically exhibit, any sympathy with such a man. No doubt they admired him, while he was protecting their homes and guarding their treasures, as they would any faithful watch dog who kept the thief from their doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But now that he is dead, they have no further use for him.--They are sorry, perhaps, that he is dead, for they do not feel so secure in their possessions, but they can make themselves safe by taking their gold and themselves from the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>They can eat, drink, and be merry in some foreign land; they can make a great show with their ill-gotten gains, and that is all they live for. Who could expect such creatures to do reverence to the memory of <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the man whose meet and drink it was to serve <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We do not doubt that there are many people in this country, not included in the money-grasping classes to whom we have referred, who have failed from other causes than those we have mentioned to do honor to the memory of the departed hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>But for their own sake, and for the sake of the country, it is time they should wipe off the stigma which is resting upon us. Not for his sake!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Far from it. Mortal man cannot add to the stature of his fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It stands sublime and complete, rising higher than the loftiest mountain ranges, for the eyes of all mankind rest upon it, and generation after generation of the human race will look up to it as the dwellers upon the earth look up to the eternal stars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Nor can it add to the repose of the great warrior's soul that the multitude burn incense at his shrine, or build a costly pile in his honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Let not the army carry off the laurels in this undertaking, as in every other manly and noble achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Let not even <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the frozen isles of the <rs>North</rs> put us to the blush by their superior appreciation of the worth of a great soul. </p> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>It is necessarily accompanied by innumerable and serious embarrassments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The subject matter of this communication is beset with peculiar and painful embarrassments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Yet, the necessities of the times, the posture of our military, civil, social, and judicial affairs, render necessary the wisest forecast, the most delicate foresight, the most deliberate caution, and the sternest integrity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> Public faith, like private virtue, needs the impregnable barrier of inflexible principle to shield it from outward assaults and inward temptations; and, like private virtue, when once distinctly gained from outward influences or inward corruption, public faith is irretrievably lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>No patchwork can ever restore it; no whitewashing will ever regain if its original purity, or impress it with the original stamp of popular or historic approbation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> It is proposed to revoke, annul, and abrogate all previous legislation of Congress on the subject of substitutes in the army, and to place in the regular service all men who have, under that system of legislation, put in substitutes for the war.--On this proposition my clients, all of whom are your constituents, have asked my legal opinion in this form: &#x0022;Has Congress the constitutional or rightful authority to pass a law revoking and disavowing its previous legislation on this question; and if such an act should be passed, does it, or can it, divest accrued or accruing rights under the previous acts of Congress, and the concurrent orders, rules, and regulations of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> in furtherance and execution of those laws?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> To this proposition I have unhesitatingly replied that Congress has no such constitutional or rightful authority, and that no law thus passed can legally divest accrued or accruing rights perfected under, and by virtue of, such previous legislation of Congress, and sanctioned by the concurrent and executory orders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> Upon this subject, as a legal proposition, I had supposed there could be no serious difference of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The sources of supply are to be found by restoring to the army all who are improperly absent, putting an end to substitution, modifying the exemption law, restricting details, and placing in the ranks such of the able-bodied men now employed as wagoners, nurses, cooks, and other employees, as are doing service for which the negroes may be found competent. </p> </q><bibl n="The President"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Not only has the numerical strength of the army been seriously impaired by the frequent desertion for which substitutes have become notorious, but dissatisfaction has been excited among those who have been unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded of avoiding the military service of their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> &#x0022;I fully concur in the opinion expressed by the <rs>Secretary</rs>, that there is no ground for the objection that a new provision, to include those who furnished substitutes under the former call, would be a breach of contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>To accept a substitute was to confer a privilege, not to enter into a contract, and whenever the substitute is rendered liable to conscription, it would seem to follow that the principal, whose place he had taken, should respond for him, as the <rs>Government</rs> had received no consideration for his exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Where, however, the new provision of law would fall to embrace a substitute now in the ranks, there appears, if the principal should again be conscribed, to be an equitable ground for compensation to the con <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> script, who then would have added to the service a soldier not otherwise liable to enrollment. &#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> But let us see if there was indeed &#x0022;no contract&#x0022; in these substitute cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>A man from <placeName reg="Mississippi, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, impelled by high and patriotic motives, volunteered for <num value="1">one</num> year in <dateStruct value="1861-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>He left at home <num value="1">one</num> son, his wife, and several younger children, all daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The son was <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> old.--This man owned a small plantation and <num value="2">two</num> negro men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>This took in the son, and retained the father, being under <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> of age. They are now both in the army by the act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>There is no <num value="1">one</num> to look after or protect the family and property of this man. The act, by Congress, however, which takes in his son, provides for the substitution by the father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>This man, confiding in the plighted faith and pledged act of Congress, the <rs>President</rs>, and the <rs>Government</rs>, determines to avail himself of this legislation &mdash; not as a &#x0022;privilege, &#x0022; but as a guaranteed right, a vested power, a valid promise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> But he has no ready money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>He borrows <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">five thousand dollars</measure> to purchase a substitute, and thus relieve himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>To enable him to borrow this sum he has to execute a deed of trust on his little homestead and <num value="2">two</num> negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>He does this, and the substitute is put in, accepted, and he is honorably discharged from the service for the war. He returns to his farm, expecting, by industry, self-denial, and economy, to release his land from the encumbrance created, on the faith of his discharge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> Congress, at the instance and under the advice of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, annuls his discharge, and places him again in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>His negroes run off &mdash; his crops fall for want of his presence; his outstanding debt of <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">five thousand dollars</measure> becomes due; the creditor enforces the deed of trust, and advertises his land for sale, which had been thus hypothecated on the faith of the act of Congress, approved by the <rs>President</rs>, and promulgated by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>, as an army order, (<rs n="General Order 30" type="misc">General Order No. 30</rs>, current series, <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.) </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>And yet this is &#x0022;no contract?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> There is yet another and higher consideration involved in this proposed model legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>As the laws existed, and the orders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> were issued and executed, a very large number of men who were not liable to service at the time were induced to put into the service for the war substitutes, in order to anticipate any subsequent call of men over <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> of age, or any call by the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> I have thus, gentlemen, presented as briefly as I can such considerations as it occurred to me necessary and proper to invoke your calm, mature deliberation on this grave subject, in which so many of your constituents are deeply interested, and, more than all, which, in my opinion, so seriously touches the good faith of the <rs>Government</rs>.--In doing so I have but discharged my duty to my clients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>None, in my opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>But is there no way by which all of these men can be rendered serviceable, and yet the good faith of the <rs>Government</rs> preserved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>It is certain that these men never asked Congress to pass the law which it is now sought to abrogate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It was the voluntary act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>This part of our defence has been unfortunately neglected.
