<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The heart of our whole people bleeds over the fallen hero, whom they loved so well because he so loved their cause, and vindicated it, not only with vast energy and courage, but with the most complete self-abnegation, simplicity, and single-mindedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There was such an entire absence of pretension, vanity, ambition, and self in every shape about <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, that he had become a popular idol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The affections of every house-hold in the nation were twined about this great and unselfish warrior, who, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, was an unknown man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He has fallen, and a nation weeps, but not as those without hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>No grave more glorious can a soldier ask than the lap of victory; no future brighter than that which awaits <num value="1">one</num> who united with the soldier the saint! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Nor is the loss to his country, great as it is, irreparable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>No doubt the puerile <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will be encouraged to believe that, now that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> is dead, the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> is certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Let them cross the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> again, and the delusion will be dispelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The veterans of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s corps, the men whom he led and loved, will show at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity whether or not they are capable of avenging his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>True it is that amongst the galaxy of Confederate stars <num value="1">one</num> has disappeared, but others are left equal in magnitude and brilliancy, and, as the darkness deepens, still others will be revealed, of which we now know as little as we did <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago of the <num value="1">one</num> we have lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>At the head of our armies is still the great <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, whose masterly combinations <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> assisted to execute with unsurpassed vigor and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Most of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s great Marshals were unknown men, and arose from the ranks, and why should not the <rs>Southern</rs> army, whose privates are in such large measure men of education as well as spirit, equal and even surpass in these respects the armies of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<head>Vallandigham a arrest.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The arrest of that brave and able defender of constitutional rights at the <rs>North</rs>--<persName n="Vallandigham,,C.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> &mdash; is an event which ought to lead to some great consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Whether it will or not remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It may be that the small riots, so soon suppressed, the arrest of a number of <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName>'s friends, together with the extinction of the newspaper at <placeName reg="Dayton, Montgomery, Ohio" key="tgn,7013511">Dayton</placeName> called the <hi rend="italics">Empire,</hi> of which <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> V. was the editor, is to end the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If it stops just there, then indeed the <rs>Northern</rs> people are under the control of a despotism unsurpassed for its efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It may be inferred that the step taken by the <rs>Government</rs> was prompted by the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>For a long time it has discontinued the arrests of citizens of the <rs>North</rs> on suspicion of disloyalty, or for words uttered <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> never has ceased to declare his horror of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> despotism, and to denounce its usurpations of power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But even when <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was arresting <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and filling his prisons, he would not put his hands on the fearless <rs>Congressman</rs> from <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Therefore his arrest at this time betrays a sense of exigency not before entertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Whether or no the people agreeing with <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> will tamely contemplate his imprisonment &mdash; will uncomplainingly and inactively acquiesce in the arrest of their great leader and hundreds of others of their fellow citizens &mdash; time must disclose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Certainly he is not the leader of a small party &mdash; certainly the wave agitated by his powerful intellect was no small <num value="1">one</num>--and it would indeed be strange if the scenes depicted by the last arrival from the <rs>North</rs> should be the last of them all. The great reverses of the <name>Federalists</name> at the <rs>Wilderness</rs> and <rs>Fredericksburg</rs> may give some encouragement to the opposition and elicit some further evidence of its vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>All we can say is, that if, after the demonstrations we have heard of at the <rs>North</rs>, there be a universal submission there to the atrocious despotism at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, then the <rs>Northern</rs> people are not fit for free institutions, and should not be allowed to enjoy them. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The natural response will be, &#x0022;Why don't you go yourself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Old Abe, <persName n="Seward,,W.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Seward,W.,H.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> <hi rend="italics">Chronicle,</hi> and other bellicose throats of the nation, all nearer the scene of conflict than those you call upon, why don't you girl on your swords and hurry to the bloody banquet you are so fond of inviting other people to?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> But all these remonstrances will be of no avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> may as well make up their minds to follow the <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> who have gone before them.--And if they have not the courage to resist <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s standing army, what may they expect when they come to confront the warriors who have so often cut the minions of Lincolnism to pieces?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>There is a dismal prospect before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Their only encouragement is the confession which the late battle has scourged from the <rs>Washington</rs> <hi rend="italics">Chronicle,</hi> that the nation is in &#x0022;her great agony.&#x0022; We don't question it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is too fearful to contemplate.
