<head>Supplies Wanted for soldiers' families</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> There is great want of provisions for the support of the poor of this city, and more especially of soldiers' families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Every consideration of humanity, patriotism, and gratitude &mdash; gratitude to the soldiers who have repelled the foe and thus far preserved our hearthstones unpolluted by his hated footsteps &mdash; demands that the wives and children of the gallant men in the field should not suffer for want of bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The citizen in town, and out of town should give this sentiment an active and effective expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Supplies should be procured for these people now so much in need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> has neither meadows, nor fields; she cultivates no ground and gathers no grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>But she will give money freely &mdash; as freely as water &mdash; for the benefit of her poor and especially those whom the soldier leaves after him when he goes to the field, to her motherly care and protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Money, however, they cannot live upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It can only procure from the country where they are produced, the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>To the people of the country we must look for these; and to them how should we appeal in vain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>They are surely not less sensible to the tender appeals of humanity than we are in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Surely they are not less grateful for the services of the brave men who have protected them as well as the people of the city from the ravages of the foe which would have deprived them of all they possess on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Can they not spare something of their stores to relieve the wants of the dependent families of soldiers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Not as a gratuity &mdash; but send it to us and receive for it their price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The city is ready to buy their grain and their meat for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>All we ask is that they will use some diligence in forwarding these things &mdash; that they will under the urgency of the appeal which should reach every heart not harder than adamant &mdash; at once send what they can. We do not over estimate the exigency, and there should be no delay in doing what is to be done. </p>
