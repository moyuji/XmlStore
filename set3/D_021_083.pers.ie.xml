<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The bombardment drags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>For some raze not easily explained or understood, we are now lying at anchor waiting for the consummation of other movements, without clag anything to hasten the results of the expedition further than to send an occasional shell over to the vicinity of the rebel earthworks, without <unclear></unclear> to ascertain whether they accomplish much or little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>For the past <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> we have fired probably <num value="50">fifty</num> mortar shells a day, receiving sometimes <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, and on <num value="1">one</num> day no return shot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The known results of our fire thus far are simply to <unclear></unclear> and destroy the <orgName n="Upper Battery" type="battery">upper battery</orgName> on the <rs>Kentucky</rs> shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Not a response of any kind has been heard from that work for <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>. All that can be scanned by the most powerful <unclear></unclear> is the bare earthworks, <unclear></unclear> with <num value="2">two</num> black looking objects rising above them, which are discovered to be logs propped up in the semblance of guns. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last the <rs type="place">Mound City</rs>, which has been cross in shore on the point opposite the rebel batteries, commenced a heavy and sharp fire from <num value="3">three</num> of her guns on a point of land above the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Battery">first battery</orgName>, and kept it up for probably <measure n="20minutes" type="date">20 minutes</measure>, accompanied by <num value="2">two</num> of the mortars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We watched the direction of the shots and marked the spot where they took effect with some interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The balls threw up magnificent jets of water and clouds of dirt <unclear></unclear> bank, keeping up a lively agitation in the water for some minute, when the <unclear></unclear> were poured in <unclear></unclear> creating the <unclear></unclear> after the firing had cease we learned that the rebels had been discovered mounting a large gun in the woods higher up, and commanding our mortar come and transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The attempt fallen, as the gun was overturned and the men dispersed in a few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Since then there has been no hostile <unclear></unclear> from that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is supposed that we have now only the <orgName n="Lower Battery" type="battery">lower batteries</orgName> at the extreme recess in the band of the river, and those on the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, <unclear></unclear> and against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>These must have suffered also, as their fire as quite reserved, and hardly so good as during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> battle. </p> </div4>

<head>The Rebels moving further back.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> As I write to day there is but little appearance of a hostile force in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But a few white tents are to be discovered at the head of the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, and a few more on the shore, right across from it. <num value="2">Two</num> steamers are to be seen with steam up, on the main shore, just out of the range of our guns, while others may be seen puffing up and down the further side of the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, sometimes as if in great haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The nondescript <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName>, gunboat, ram, or whatever it may be &mdash; for it is called by all sorts of names &mdash; is still moored in a bend in the north shore of the <rs type="place">Island</rs> undisturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Behind the entrenchments, the glass discovers only a few isolated men, marching to and fro, apparently unconcerned at our presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The general impression here is that the enemy is moving his encampment back from the river's edge, out of the reach of our shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This is confirmed by the constant visits of she transports, which seem to be unloading something like provisions, brought up from below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The question of commissariat must have become to them a very serious <num value="1">one</num>, inasmuch as their retreating comrades from New Madrid could not bring away their stores, and can only <unclear></unclear> in consuming those on hand at the island. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head>Will the <rs>Rebels</rs> evacuate?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most natural inquiry for every <num value="1">one</num> who reaches this point is to ask: Will the enemy evacuate, or make their fleet stand at this point?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is difficult for <num value="1">one</num> who is supposed to be kept in ignorance of the place of the commanders to give an intelligent answer; but reasoning from the known facts of the siege, and the rules governing all military operations, we may say that every day tends to lesson the probability of their evacuation to that of a determined resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Our delay, coming as it does after the capture of New Madrid, is most unfortunate for our cause, because every day of resistance to an idle fleet gives increased assurance to the foe that we stand in some fear of their batteries, and all the ingenious excuses made to account for our delay but serve to strengthen this feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>If we fear those a <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName> mere banks of earth as they are, hostile thrown up, and, we judge, entirely without casemates, be sufficient to hold as back for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, how much more may they not expect of the more elaborate defences at <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Had the former falls even after a severe struggle and some loss to our side, the moral effect must have been disastrous to the rebels, who would no longer feel safe in their lower position. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> The message of the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs> is arm in spirit without being defiant, and candid without betraying apprehension for the result of the late disasters of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>It readily acknowledges that for once future had deserted the <rs>Southern</rs> a me; and it refers their double misfortune to the extension of the national line of defence over too long a tract of country to it in keeping with the resources at the command of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>It holds that it was impossible for the <rs>Southern</rs> legions to be at once strong on the <placeName key="tgn,2592540;tgn,2038647" n="0.349 000000.6983	placename;tgn,2592540;Cumberland River, Kentucky, Kentucky,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;0.349 000000.6983	placename;tgn,2038647;Eddyville, Lyon, Kentucky,Lyon,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America" reg="Cumberland River, Kentucky, Kentucky,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;Eddyville, Lyon, Kentucky,Lyon,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America">Cumberland river</placeName> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, strong on the <unclear></unclear> and strong upon the whole of their vast seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>There is no doubt that this is but the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Amiss on the offensive and armies on the defensive each have their advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>I requires greater strength to subjugate a country than it requires to defend it; and, so far, the position has been in favor of the <rs>South</rs>, but on the other hand, the attacking power has, so far as geography will allow its own choice of the quarter to which it shall direct its assault; and there the advantage lies with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>These circumstances explain <unclear></unclear> <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00594" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> is still able to declare with probability that the <rs>Guit States</rs> an never he train led down by the enemy, and why the <rs>North</rs> had been almost invariably victorious on <unclear></unclear>. In penetrating the far interior of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> the <rs>Northern</rs> armies would be subjected to almost every conceivable disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>But, in the <unclear></unclear> attacks made by the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>, the former has the choice of nearly the whole hostile seaboard, from the coast of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>It was needful therefore for the <rs>South</rs> to be as strong at every point on the seaboard as the <rs>North</rs> could render itself at any <num value="1">one</num> point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/><persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00595" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> however, lakes no comfort from this <unclear></unclear> he acknowledges the fall of <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke island</placeName> to be extremely humiliating to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>But the looks, nevertheless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>upon this disaster and that of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> as merely exceptional <unclear></unclear> and speaks only the language of encouragement and confidence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> The financial side of the <rs>Southern President</rs>'s picture is certainly the most cheerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>He shows that the annual expenditure of the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs> has not exceeded <measure n="175000000dollars" type="currency">$175,000,000</measure>. <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00596" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> may boast with reason that this does not amount to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the annual expenditure of the <rs>Northern Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>He points out also that it is inferior to the annual value of the cotton crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>But, unfortunately, the cotton crop yields no profits, owing to the desperate policy on which the <name>Southerners</name> resolved at the outset of the war. It is quite true, however, that the relation of the expenditure to the value of the cotton crop, if saleable, has a direct bearing on the capacity of the <rs>South</rs> to defray the interest, in years of pence, upon the public debt that they may accumulate during war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00597" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> appeals, also, to the increasing production of the implements of war in the <rs>Southern States</rs> as evidence of the increasing capacity of the <rs>South</rs> to continue its resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>He observes, with unquestionable truth, that when hostilities began the advantage, in respect of attainable material of war, was greatly on the side of his adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The <rs>North</rs> had nearly a monopoly of the artizens and workshops required for warlike purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>It was, therefore, left with the <rs>South</rs> either to make bricks without straw, or to rely upon import from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>But the blockade deprived them of all but an incidental supply from other countries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/> The great part of the <rs>Southern</rs> army has since taken the field with equipments of native manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/><persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00598" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> has, therefore, reason to maintain the position asserted in his previous message, that his country was becoming more and more independent of the blockade, and that it was gradually producing all that was required both for peace and for war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> Nevertheless, it appears impossible that the contest can continue very long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>It is quite sufficient for <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> Confederacies to be unable to fight further to insure its termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Whether the <rs>South</rs> can continue hostilities for an indefinite period or not, <hi rend="italics">it seems every c'car that the <rs>North</rs> can not.</hi> Victorious in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, great prospects open before the more ambitious politicians in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and New York, who think they see in these successes the fall of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>But public men at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, let them say what they will, probably know batter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>They know that the farther they go the more they will be extending their operations from the base of them; and the greater, also, will be the opposition they will receive, They are in a fair way to repossess the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>But they see that nothing can be more different than reclaiming <placeName key="tgn,7007825" n="1.000 14" reg="tennessee">Tennessee</placeName>, and reclaiming the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/><placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, like <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>; has been lukewarm and divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>From their own uncontested <unclear></unclear> they have made at last something approaching to an acquisition of these <num value="2">two</num> waverers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>But, in penetrating the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, they would not only have a far more serious opposition to encounter; they would also run the danger of <unclear><num value="10">Ten</num></unclear> see rising against them in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>There is no doubt that it makes an immense difference to the <rs>South</rs> whether <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> belong to their confederacy or that if the <rs>South</rs>, <unclear></unclear> he impression is said to <unclear>fe ganing</unclear> ground in the <rs>North</rs>, also, that this is the almost limit of Federal acquisitions that is possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>The recent successes moreover, appear to have been popularly construed in the <rs>North</rs> as implying she close of the war. They could only imply this on the supposition of a compromise being imminent; for they certainly do not shake the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>The Washington Government might now close the struggle with <unclear>cre-</unclear> to themselves, if they chose, on the boats of the <hi rend="italics">status quo,</hi> or at any rate after a few <unclear></unclear> encounters should have more clearly established the extent of the territory they held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>But there cannot be much doubt that if they do not, the struggle must, before long, <unclear></unclear> of itself by the collapse of Northern resources and the impracticability of Northern not quest. </p> </div3>
