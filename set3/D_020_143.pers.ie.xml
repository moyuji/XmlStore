<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Yet while I was a prisoner there, including the months of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, when the weather was very rainy and severely cold, no fires were allowed in the prison to warm the half naked and shivering prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Promises were made from time to time by the subordinate officers that the prison should be warmed either by stoves or by a steam-heating apparatus, but up to the <date value="10-29">29th day of October</date> no steps had been taken looking to that end. To add to the discomfort of the poor prisoners, the wretched shanties, their only shelter, leaked badly, keeping the floor, their only bed, and even their scanty bed clothing, soaked with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The fear was entertained by the prisoners generally, and constantly expressed that it was the intention that they should perish from the effects of cold and damp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>This treatment of human beings by those calling themselves Christians is unparalleled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Inhumanity and cruelty by the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> towards those in its power is a <sic>a</sic> policy which has been <sic>suggestad</sic> by many of its allies to put <sic>pown</sic> the rebellion. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/> An exception is made where the dispatches are from an ambassador in neutral country to his own government, but which can hardly be extended to the credentials and instructions of officers proceeding from a belligerent to a neutral port on the business of the belligerent power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>The officers of the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs>, however, appear to have abstained from trespassing on this somewhat debatable ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>They confined themselves to arresting passengers who were voyaging in no merely private capacity, nor on private business; not escaping from the troubles of war, or seeking a home for their families in a neutral country; but notoriously commissioned to procure recognition and success for their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>With the utmost desire to put the largest interpretation on the rights of neutrals, if only as a means of procuring the entire abolition of captures at sea, we yet cannot understand the fairness of excluding the <name>Federalists</name> from such an obvious resort of belligerent power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/> It would be asking too much that they should stand by and make no effort to prevent our ships conveying to and fro persons and papers on the enemy's service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>As his <q>&#x0022;right of search&#x0022;</q> was denied, the information required was, of course, peremptorily refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>He then stated that he had information that <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00314" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Mason">Mason</rs>, <persName n="Eustis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00315" reg="mostcommon:Eustis,nomatch:0"><surname>Eustis</surname></persName>, and <persName n="McFarland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00316" reg="mostcommon:McFarland,nomatch:0"><surname>McFarland</surname></persName> were on board, and demanded that they should be given up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/> This also being indignantly refused, <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00317" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> himself came forward, and said that the tour gentlemen named were then before him, but appeared to the <rs>British</rs> flag, under which they were sailing, for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The <rs>Lieutenant</rs> said that his orders were to take them on board the <rs type="ship">San Jacinto</rs> by force if they would not surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>He then walked to the side of the ship and waved his hand; immediately <num value="3">three</num> more heavily armed boats pushed off and surrounded the ship, and the party of marines who came in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> boat came up and took possession of the quarter deck; these, however, he ordered down on the main deck, to take charge of the gang-way ports. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/> Any open resistance to such a force was of course hopeless, although from the loud and repeated plaudits which followed <persName n="Williams,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00319" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>'s protestation, and which were joined in by every <num value="1">one</num>, without exception, of the passengers congregated on the quarter-deck, men of all nations, and from the manifest desire of some to resist to the last, I have no doubt but that every person would have joined heart and soul in the struggle had our <rs type="role2">Commander</rs> but given the order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/> Such an order he could not, under such adverse circumstances, conscientiously give, and it was therefore considered sufficient that a party of marines, with bayonets fixed, should forcibly lay hands on the gentlemen named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>This was done, and the gentlemen retired to their cabins to arrange some few changes of clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>A most heartrending scene now took place between <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00320" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, his eldest daughter, a noble girl devoted to her father, and the <rs>Lieutenant</rs>. </p>
