<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> My experience has been with the <rs>Monadnock</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,2050042" n="1.000 5" reg="saugus, essex county, massachusetts">Saugus</placeName>, <rs type="ship2">Mahopac</rs> and <persName n="Canonicus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Canonicus,nomatch:0"><surname>Canonicus</surname></persName>, all vessels of some difference of construction, and built, I believe, by different contractors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> Before leaving <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, and while waiting for the army to provide troops for the land part of this expedition, I sent the <term type="ship">monitors</term> <rs type="ship">Canonicus</rs>, <rs type="ship">Mahopac</rs> and <rs type="ship">Saugus</rs> up the <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.281 000000.5620	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.281 000000.5620	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName> to try what they could do with the rebel batteries at <placeName reg="Howlett">Howlett</placeName>'s and above that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/><num value="1">One</num> of their shells or shots, however, struck the <rs>Saugus</rs> fair on the turret, and knocked out and loosened <num value="40">forty</num> bolts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> This was owing to the bolts being driven from inside to out, instead of from outside to in. The turret was not materially injured, and was repaired again in about <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, and I have been using the <rs>Saugus</rs> here, against these works, where she has done effective service. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> The <rs>Canonicus</rs>, <rs type="ship2">Mahopac</rs> and <rs type="ship2">Monadnock</rs> left <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, the former <num value="2">two</num> in tow of <term type="ship">steamers</term>, the <rs type="ship">Monadnock</rs> going under steam, with a steamer in company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The weather was quite rough, and at times the sea would go over the turrets and down the funnels; but I passed them while at sea, and they were making excellent weather of it. On asking their commander, afterwards, how they got along, the answer was, &#x0022;Oh, quite well, sir; only a little damp.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> On arriving at <placeName reg="Beaufort, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2073632">Beaufort, North Carolina</placeName>, I filled them up with coal and ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>I found a defect in a pump on board the <rs type="ship">Canonicus</rs>--a &#x0022;centrifugal pump&#x0022; they called it &mdash; which did not fetch the water until there was a foot or more in the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>This was a serious defect, and <num value="1">one</num> for which the constructors were very culpable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The <rs>Mahopac</rs>'s decks leaked considerably, and made the officers and crew very uncomfortable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> The monitors started from <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, the <rs>Canonicus</rs> and <rs>Mahopac</rs> being towed, the <rs>Monadnock</rs> declining such assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Indeed, she did not require it, outrunning the largest vessels easily, and keeping ahead of all except the very fastest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> On the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st ultimo</day></dateStruct> it came on to blow hard from the southwest, and a very heavy sea commenced rolling in. The vessels were all anchored in <num value="13">thirteen</num> fathoms water, with a long scope of chair out. Most of the large vessels dragged during the gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The <rs n="Tuscarora" type="nativeamerican">Tuscarora</rs> and Juniata put to sea (I think unnecessarily while the monitors rode it out beautifully. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> I was anchored quite near them, and witnessed their performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>I at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> thought I had been imprudent, and had unnecessarily risked the lives of officers and men, but I went to sleep the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night of the gale quite easy in my mind in regard to the monitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>I saw that they were making the best weather and riding easier than any of the other vessels in the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>All the transports cut and run; though I think that was quite unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>After the gale, I inquired of the commanders of the monitors how they passed through the ordeal, and they seemed to think they got along very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The smaller monitors &mdash; <rs type="ship2">Mahopac</rs> and <persName n="Canonicus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Canonicus,nomatch:0"><surname>Canonicus</surname></persName> &mdash; at times almost disappeared from view, and the commander of the former vessel complained of discomfort, owing to the decks leaking; but the vessels were in no danger at any time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> As to the <rs>Monadnock</rs>, she could ride out a gale at anchor in the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic ocean</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>She is certainly a most perfect success so far as the hull and machinery are concerned, and is only defective in some minor details, which, in the building of these vessels, require the superintendence of a thorough seaman and a practical and ingenious man. The <rs>Monadnock</rs> is capable of crossing the ocean alone (when her compasses are once adjusted properly), and could destroy any vessel in the <rs>French</rs> or <rs>British</rs> navy, lay their towns under contribution, and return again (provided she could pick up coal) without fear of being followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>She could certainly clear any harbor on our coast of blockaders in case we were at war with a foreign Power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>As strong and thick as the sides of this vessel are, <num value="1">one</num> heavy shot from <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> indented the iron on her side armor, without, however, doing any material damage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> These vessels have laid <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> under a fire from <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, anchored less than <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure> off, and though fired at a great deal, they were seldom hit, and received no injury, except to boats and light matter about decks, which were pretty well cut to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Compared with the ironsides, their fire is very slow, and not at all calculated to silence heavy batteries, which require a rapid and continuous fire to drive men from their guns; but they are famous coadjutors in a fight, and put in the heavy blows which tell on casemates and bombproof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The smaller class of monitors, as at present constructed, will always require the aid of a steamer to tow them and take care of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>In smooth weather they ought to go along by themselves, and, when towed, the tow-rope should never be less than <num value="200">two hundred</num> fathoms in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It strains them very much to have a short tow line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> I do not know yet what their real durability is, or would be, in a continuous fire against their turrets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Solid <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> or <num value="200">200</num>-pounder rifles are apt to break something when they strike, and I should be much better satisfied myself to be behind <unclear></unclear> what comes than to be shut up in an iron turret, not knowing whether it is properly constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>This, though, is the prejudice of a sailor, and should have no weight whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The commanders of the monitors seem to feel quite at home and safe in them, and apprehend no more damage at sea than in any other kind of vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/><persName n="Senott,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Senott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Senott</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Monadnock</rs>, remarked that he did not see any difference between her and anything else. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> The <rs>Saugus</rs> joined me after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's fight off <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and was towed around from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> by the <rs>Nereus</rs> in very rough weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The vessel leaked a good deal through her bows, and some uneasiness was felt for her on that account, but her sea-going qualities were spoken of as good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The difficulty was a mechanical <num value="1">one</num>, and in no way detracts from the mechanical qualities of the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>There is no great amount of comfort on board these vessels at sea; that is conceded on all sides; but they are seldom at sea, and only exposed when making a voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>This is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, I believe, that the monitors have ridden out heavy gales in an open sea, at anchor, though they have ridden out gales in <address><street n="Charleston roads">Charleston roads</street></address>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> I have only to remark that the principle is a good <num value="1">one</num>, if the vessels are all built like the <rs>Monadnock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The fire of these vessels, continued with the fire of such vessels as the New Ironsides and heavy frigates, is very effective, particularly against heavy plated vessels, bombproof and stone or brick walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>I have never yet seen a vessel that came up to my ideas of what is required for offensive operations as much as the <rs>Ironsides</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>She combines very many good qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The most important is the comfort with which the people on board of her live, though she would be no match for the <rs>Monadnock</rs> in a fight, the latter having more speed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> The accuracy of fire is, I think, in favor of the <rs>Ironsides</rs>, judging from what I have seen here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The turrets get filled with smoke, and do not clear as quick as the <rs>Ironsides</rs>, though the defect could be avoided by not firing both guns so near together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>These impressions of mine are formed from a short experience with monitors, but I think they will be found correct, provided the monitors are properly built. </p> <closer> <salute>I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Porter,,David,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="default:Porter,David,D.,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName>  <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Rear admiral">Rear Admiral</rs>,</signed> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Welles,the Honorable,Gideon,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="default:Welles,Gideon,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Gideon</foreName> <surname>Welles</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington, D.
