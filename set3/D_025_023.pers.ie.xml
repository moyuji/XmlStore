<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> By the <rs>Central</rs> train of last evening we have a report of a considerable engagement several days ago between the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName></orgName> and <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hill,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Hill</surname></persName> and a heavy body of the enemy at <num value="1">one</num> of the passes in the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The exact location of this fight, or the particular day on which it occurred, could not be ascertained; but our forces are represented to have achieved a decided advantage in the affair and to have captured a large number of prisoners and several pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>A very intelligent gentleman, who came up the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> from below <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, says he learns nothing of any general fight, but knows there have been a number of heavy skirmishes, in which we were generally successful in repulsing the enemy, who were pressing vigorously and closely upon our rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The stages proceeding down the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> were stopped at <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the enemy having appeared in formidable force at <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>, on the <rs type="place">Valley turnpike</rs>, <placeName><distance reg="17miles">seventeen miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName></placeName>, and <placeName><distance reg="12miles">twelve miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName></placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The passengers who came up on the returned stages from <placeName reg="Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2115141">Woodstock</placeName> report that during <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> they heard heavy and brisk cannonading down the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, and the presumption was that <orgName n="division"><persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, which was guarding the wagon train, was engaged with the enemy. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> This dispatch has been copied into the <orgName n="Richmond Papers" type="newspaper">Richmond papers</orgName>, and as its official character may cause it to be believed, I desire to state that it is incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The enemy did not capture any organized body of men on that occasion, but only stragglers and such as were left asleep on the road, exhausted by the fatigue and exposure of <num value="1">one</num> of the most inclement nights I have ever known at this season of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It rained without cessation, rendering the road by which our troops marched to the bridge at <placeName key="tgn,2118207" n="1.000 18" reg="falling waters, berkeley, west virginia">Falling Waters</placeName> very difficult to pass, and causing so much delay that the last of the troops did not cross the river at the bridge until <time value="1pm">1 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>While the column was thus detained on the road a number of men, worn down with fatigue, lay down in barns and by the roadside, and, though officers were sent back to arouse them, as the troops moved on, the darkness and rain prevented them from finding all, and many were in this way left behind.
