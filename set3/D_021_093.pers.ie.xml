<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The circumstances connected with the surrender of this position, with all its guns, ammunition, &#x0026;c., are humiliating in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The daily bulletin from <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName> for many days represented that the enemy, after an incessant bombardment of many hours, had inflicted no injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>They certainly did; and were it not that we have been so often surprised by the surrender of forts and fortifications that were boasted of as impregnable, we should, indeed, be amazed at the surrender of the famed <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName>, which has furnished so many paragraphs for telegraphing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Could they not have been destroyed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Why add all this and the provisions to the new present of cannon to the <name>Federalists</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Our gifts of cannon have been quite munificent &mdash; even to impoverishing ourselves &mdash; and we need not add so liberally of other things in our offerings to those who are better supplied than we are. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> Of course our readers are aware that the <rs>Merrimac</rs> was not <q>&#x0022;perforated by shot, &#x0022;</q> that the <rs>Monitor</rs> did not <q>&#x0022;draw the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blood,&#x0022;</q> and that the <rs>Virginia</rs> <q>&#x0022;did not retire.&#x0022;</q> The whole is a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lie out of the whole cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Of course, our papers never reach <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>; but we should have thought that any man who has sufficient retentions to entitle him to a seat upon the editorial tripod of the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> would have had sense enough to entertain some doubt in such a case as this, where the person or persons had not been on board the <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs>, and could not possibly know the extent of the damage sustained by her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>In some places &mdash; from the heat and weight of the shot &mdash; the plates were welded together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>In other places, the plates were broken, but not broken through, and the damage was repaired by simply taking off the injured plates and putting on others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Her prow, which was made of cast iron, was broken when she ran into the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, but she supplied herself with a better <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>So far from flying herself, she made the <rs>Monitor</rs> tuck tail and run into shoal water, under the protection of the guns of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and there she still lies, not daring to poke her nose outside, in spite of the <rs>Virginia</rs>'s insults and challenges. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> In the whole course of the war there has never been baser or more palpable lying, on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, than that in connection with this fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>And yet <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mendacity has been unbounded, and continues to be so.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> We saw gentlemen last evening who had conversed with some <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> officers attached to the <orgName type="regiment" key="15NCRegiment">15th North Carolina regiment</orgName>, and who were in the fight on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>From them we get a few additional particulars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> It is stated by <num value="1">one</num>, that the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> North Caroline had been in line of battle for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> during the day, momently expecting an attack, but the enemy not appearing, they were ordered to stack arms, and prepare for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>While enjoying their repast, a couple of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> companies waded <placeName reg="Warwick, Accomack, Virginia" key="tgn,1131642">Warwick river</placeName>, a very narrow stream, which was believed to be unfordable, and thus eluding our pickets, came suddenly upon the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The long roll was sounded immediately, and the men rushed to their arms, driving the enemy back into the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, killing all of both companies except <num value="8">eight</num>, who surrendered and were taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>It is stated that it was during this charge <persName n="McKinney,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="nearbymention:McKinney,Robert,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>McKinney</surname></persName> was killed, the bullet striking him at the top of the forehead and passing through his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>He died instantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> Another statement represents that the regiment was drawn up in line of battle, and the <rs>Colonel</rs>, discovering that <num value="1">one</num> wing of his regiment appeared to falter, rushed in that direction, with his cap off, and waved to his men to follow him. This singled him out as a prominent mark for the enemy's sharp shooters, and he fell mortally wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> The enemy, hearing the firing, appeared in large numbers on the opposite bank of the river, and the fighting then became general, the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC15">Fifteenth North Carolina</orgName>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA16">Sixteenth Georgia</orgName> and the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA2">Second Louisiana</orgName> being actively engaged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> The fight lasted from <time value="3pm">three P. M.</time>, until <num value="7">seven</num>, and not from <time value="8am">eight A. M.</time> until <time value="7pm">seven P. M.</time>, as stated in our telegraphic dispatch. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> <num value="1">One</num> report says that the enemy must have had an entire brigade engaged, and that the river and the hill beyond were literally covered with the dead and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We took several prisoners, who made various statements as to their numbers, etc., but we could not hear what they were. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>These bridges, as many of our readers are aware, were the railroad, <placeName reg="Coaltar's bridge">Coaltar's</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Falmouth bridge">Falmouth bridges</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>On of our informants says that they threw a few shells across the river, but there being no response, the firing soon ceased.--Of this, however, we are not positive.--Meanwhile, the <num value="3">three</num> <term type="ship">steamers</term>, the <rs type="ship">St. Nicholas</rs>, the <rs>Virginia</rs>, and the <rs>Eureka</rs>, and some <num value="30">thirty</num> sail vessels, lying at the wharf, loaded with grain, with a considerable quantity of cotton piled near the depot, were set on fire by our men and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>The troops that were in and near the place, very few in number, and utterly inadequate to make a defence against a considerable force, evacuated <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> after having performed the duties required of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>Many of the citizens also left, abandoning their property to the <q>&#x0022;tender mercies&#x0022;</q> of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>This man stated that the <rs>Federal</rs> force amounted to <num value="6000">six thousand</num>, and that they approached <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> from <placeName reg="Fauquier, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002368">Fauquier county</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> The train that left <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> yesterday morning was stopped this side of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> by a railroad agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>A regiment of troops was stationed some <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> from the place, and the sick in the camp were placed on board the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>All the men retired in safety. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/> The enemy can easily occupy the town of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, if he has not already done so; but an advance to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> from that direction is probably not contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>The obstructions would not be easily overcome. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/> Most of the rolling stock of the railroad was removed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> As the public are informed, the <orgName n="Special Committee" type="committee">special committee</orgName> to whom was referred this matter have made a report to the <rs type="place">House</rs>, declining at present to announce the conclusion of the committee, owing to the mass of testimony yet to be accumulated; but submitting that already obtained, and asking it to be printed for the use of members. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/> In addition to this report, <num value="2">two</num> of the committee, <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00389" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName> and <persName n="Brace,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00390" reg="mostcommon:Brace,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Brace</surname></persName>, asked leave to present a minority report, expressing an opinion upon some of the subjects involved in the investigation; but consent not having been obtained, it was not presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Some portions of it, however, have been published, and it is deemed proper to publish the following extracts touching the same points from a report prepared in response thereto by another member of the committee, <persName n="Barkatale,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00391" reg="mostcommon:Barkatale,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barkatale</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<head>[Extract.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/> The undersigned solemnly protests against the conclusions enumerated in that report in relation to the conduct of <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00393" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Pillow</surname></persName>, in the matter of the surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>He protests that it is not the province of the committee, and that it was no part of the intention of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, to interfere with the constitutional prerogatives of the <rs>President</rs>, who deemed the suspension of those officers to be proper, until an investigation of their conduct could be instituted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/> Scrupulous to do no injustice, the undersigned declines to express any definite opinion in relation to the acts of those <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> on the occasion referred to, until full information upon the subject shall have been received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> It is due to candor, however, to say that with the lights now before the committee, the undersigned has net been able to arrive at the conclusion stated in the report heretofore mentioned, that all the inquiries propounded by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, have been <q> &#x0022;satisfactorily answered by those <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>&#x0022;</q> It is a painful fact that, while that report expresses an identical opinion upon the conduct of both of those officers, their official reports conflict with and contradict each other in essential and important particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Both cannot be right </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/> In the reports of <num value="1">one</num> of these officers, (<persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00394" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>,) It is stated that in the <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> he exacted as a condition of the surrender that he would take away his own brigade, by cutting through the lines of the enemy, or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>The undersigned cannot conceive why a single brigade was thought to be equal to such an undertaking, when it was not deemed attainable by the entire force under his command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> The undersigned deems it due to the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName>, and to the gallant men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="20MSRegiment">Twentieth Mississippi regiment</orgName>, to declare that, until some more <q> &#x0022;satisfactory&#x0022;</q> evidence is produced to justify the abandonment of that regiment to captivity by the <rs>General</rs> whose formes it had followed, while the other regiments of his command, raised in his own neighborhood, were afforded facility for escaping on the only steamboats at the <rs>Fort</rs>, he can join in no such report as the signers of the <num value="1">one</num> in question have deemed it their duty to submit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> In his supplemental report, <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00395" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> has stated that <q>&#x0022;no <num value="1">one</num> of the regiments&#x0022;</q> composing his command, <q>&#x0022;was wholly saved or wholly left; &#x0022;</q> but it is within the knowledge of the committee that the <orgName type="regiment" key="20MSRegiment">20th Mississippi regiment</orgName> is an exception to the remark &mdash; not exceeding <num value="6">six</num> members of that regiment having escaped with <persName n="Floyd,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00396" reg="default:Floyd,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The <q>&#x0022;<num value="300">three hundred</num>&#x0022;</q> members of the regiment reported by him to have been <q>&#x0022;saved,&#x0022;</q> it so happens, were, for the most part, absent from the fort when the battle was fought, at home, or in hospitals, on furlough, sick leave, &#x0026;c. Of the entire number (about <num value="500">500</num>.) who were in the battle, none comparatively were <q>&#x0022;saved&#x0022;</q> in the boats which took away the main portions of the other regiments, composing <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00397" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>A few escaped by land after the departure of the boats, without molestation by the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/> The undersigned submits that it required the exercise of more than ordinary ingenuity to construe, as the signers of the above-named report have done, the unofficial letter of the lamented <persName n="Johnston,General,A.,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00398" reg="default:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, dated <date value="03-18">March 18th</date>, as an expression of his approval of the surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>In a spirit of magnanimity, he speaks in general terms of his confidence <q>&#x0022;in the gallantry, energy, and devotion to the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>&#x0022;</q> of <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00399" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00400" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Pillow</surname></persName>; but he refrains from any expression implying his approval of their conduct in that affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>On the contrary, he declared that &#x0022;events (subsequent to the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>) <hi rend="italics">show that the investment was not as completes as their information from their scouts led them to believe. &#x0022;</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/> It was upon information thus pronounced to be erroneous by the <rs>General</rs> in command of the department that the fatal surrender was made, consigning to captivity the gallant a my, who, according to testimony taken by the committee, were able and eager to cut their way, if need be, out of the lines of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> In the same unofficial letter of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00401" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, he uses the following language, which certainly forbids the construction placed upon the words incorporated in the report to which this is a response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>He says: </p> <cit><q rend="inline"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/> &#x0022;When the force was detached, (for the defence of <placeName key="tgn,2031620" n="1.000 10" reg="Donaldson, Marshall, Indiana">Donelson</placeName>) I was in hopes that such dispositions would have been made as would have enabled the forces to defend the fort, <hi rend="italics">or withdraw without sacrificing the army.</hi> On the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="2">14th</day></dateStruct>, I ordered <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00402" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, by telegram, &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">if he lost the fort, to get his forces back to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.&#x0022;</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/> Whether <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00403" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> found in the circumstances attending the affair at <placeName key="tgn,2031620" n="1.000 10" reg="Donaldson, Marshall, Indiana">Donelson</placeName> a sufficient reason for the failure of the <rs>General</rs> in command to execute this order, is not stated in his letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>He preferred to await the opportunity of obtaining all the facts, and to weigh them impartially, before expressing an opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/> The undersigned imputes no improper motives to the authors of the report; but his own teres of duty impels him to protest against their conclusions being approved by this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00404" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> under circumstances so extraordinary as those which he has detailed. </p>
