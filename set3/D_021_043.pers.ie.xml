<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> After <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> of the most desperate fighting ever witnessed on this continent, (so declares a veteran regular officer,) the most desperate fighting against the most tremendous-odds, in which day after day the multitudinous host of invaders was driven back past their own camp, our glorious <orgName n="Spartan Band" type="band">Spartan band</orgName>, from sheer exhaustion, has been borne down by a new avalanche of reinforcements piled upon the already enormous weight against which they have hitherto struggled with complete success, and has suffered <num value="1">one</num> of those misfortunes which are common to war, but which entail no dishonor on our cause, and which will only animate to the most stern and undying resistance every true Southern heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>If these bloody barbarians, whose hands are now soaked to the elbows in the life-blood of men defending their own homes and firesides, dream that they are now <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> nearer the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> than when they started on their infernal mission, they prove themselves to be fools and madmen as well as savages and murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>They have taught us a lesson, we admit, they have admonished us to be more wary and circumspect, to husband with greater care our limited resources, and not to underrate our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>If they have also placed between them and on a gulf that can never be crossed by their arts or arms, and a universal determination to die, if die we must, for our country, but never permit her to be subjugated by the most malignant, the most murderous, the meanest of mankind, whose name is at this very moment such a by-word of scorn and reproach throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, for their combined cruelty and cowardice, that their own ambassadors cannot stand the storm of the world's contempt, and are all anxious to fly back to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<head>Subjugation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, elevated by the recent victories of its hireling armies, is entirely certain of the speedy and thorough subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It laughs to scorn any idea of any other possibility, and exults in delicious day-dreams of the degradation to which its enemy will be reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It glories in the consciousness of its brute strength, and intends to exercise it in the spirit of a brute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>All the enormous self-complacency and self-concept which for a while were humbled by the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> have renewed their ancient exaltation, and they fancy themselves the masters of the <name>Universe</name>, and the predestined conquerors of all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>But the work of subjugation is as distant now as ever &mdash; more distant, more impracticable than it was before the shadow of disaster had been cast upon our flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>If our early victories had been followed up, and a blow struck which would have paralyzed the <rs>North</rs> and compelled a peace, it would have been a temporary paralysis, and a peace which would have subjugated the <rs>South</rs> more completely than she is ever likely to be by the hands of her enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The inevitable consequence of a speedy peace would have been the restoration of the old commercial and manufacturing dependency of the <rs>South</rs> upon the <rs>North</rs>, with no her results of her nominal independence <unclear></unclear> a temporary exemption from abolition legislation, and the heavy expense of a separate Government, with none of those <unclear>urces</unclear> of wealth to support it which commerce, manufactures, and trade supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Such condition, call it by what name we may, <unclear></unclear> be essentially subjugation; and if the <rs>North</rs> had taken counsel of wisdom instead of pride, malignity, and revenge, it would in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance never have permitted the <unclear></unclear> to be waged, or, when it had begun, have brought it to a termination as speedily as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> When we say that the subjugation of the <unclear></unclear> is now more remote than it would have <unclear></unclear> after an early peace, we have no reference to that small minority which, in the <unclear></unclear>, as well as every community, is willing to purchase peace at any price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>There are tories in the <rs>South</rs> as there were tories in the <name>Revolution</name>, whose only sympathies are with the enemies of their country, who lament its histories and rejoice over its defeats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The subjugation of these is not the question, for of <unclear></unclear> the tyrants who threaten to oppress us, <unclear></unclear>, in the event of an opportunity, would <unclear></unclear> the most revengeful and inexorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The <unclear></unclear> in the <name>Revolution</name> committed atrocities which far surpassed the most cruel oppressors of the <rs>British</rs> invaders, and we are pressured to expect from Southern tories &mdash; happily <unclear></unclear> so many in number nor so capable of mischief as their illustrious predecessors &mdash; the exhibition of a similar spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>There is another <unclear></unclear> more numerous class who may be subjugated, because they are already subjugated by their apprehensions of the evils and calamities which are incident to a state of war.--Whilst generally honest and patriotic, they took upon national honor as an abstraction, <unclear></unclear> to be weighed against personal comfort <unclear></unclear> security and material gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/><q>&#x0022;Dying for <num value="1">one</num>'s country,&#x0022;</q> they consider a very pretty poetical sentiment, much to be admired in novels and tragedies; but, like many other poetical sentiments, nonsensical and Quixotic when reduced to practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Self-indulgence is the rule of life with many men who are patriotic, honest, virtuous, and moral as long as the exercise of those qualities costs them no sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But of any higher life than the life of the flesh they have not the faintest conception, nor can they imagine any greater evil than the loss of money, the deprivation of physical comforts, and, above all, the loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>No <num value="1">one</num> will deny that the subjugation of this class is practicable, even with a moiety of the immense forces which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has brought into the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> But such is not the spirit of the great majority of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>They are devotedly attached to their country, to its institutions, to its habits and modes of life, and they have an innate and ineradicable antagonism to the political and social system of the invading race, to their character and habits, and their very modes of speech, which the present cruel war has intensified into such passionate and profound detestation that sooner than acknowledge the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> as masters they would rather see the whole Southern country sink to the bottom of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>As a whole, the <rs>South</rs> is proud, sensitive to the last degree to a stain upon her honor, and holding death an inferior evil to degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Such men may be overrun, may be exterminated, but they cannot be subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>They will resist as long as resistance is possible, and, if conquered, they will not stay conquered.--When the spirits of a people are indomitable, </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> they can never be enslaved; and so long as the <rs>South</rs> is true to herself, she will maintain her freedom and independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> What can the enemy do with such a people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>If driven from the cities they will retire to the country, and their cities all together could not mob a town half the size of New York.--To follow them to the country, in the vast territory of the <rs>South</rs>, would require an army more numerous than that of <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>They will retire to the country and take their arms with them, each man his trusty rifle, and be prepared to seize the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity to reassert their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>They will at once destroy the cotton and other staples which the <rs>North</rs> is endeavoring to force from them by the sword, and will never cultivate them again till they can do so for their own benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Every bale of cotton in the <rs>Southern States</rs> will be burned, and the proprietors will raise wheat and corn and other articles which they have hitherto purchased of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>They will return to the simple and frugal ways of their forefathers, in dress, furniture, and all the comforts of life, manufacturing for themselves such slain and useful articles as their simple wants and absolute necessities require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> choose to hold their cities, and be masters of the only spots where their armies are quartered, these will be but islands in the midst of a vast ocean, and will not affect the freedom and independence of the people so long as they are constant to their cause and true to themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> In the very worst aspect of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, this is the extreme limit which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> subjugation can reach, even if our armies could be driven from every battle-field, and every Southern city and fort fall into the enemy's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>But the accomplishment even of that result, with all their superiority of numbers, is an achievement beyond their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>They have taught us by the perseverance with which they contrived to fight us after their signal reverses at <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2036878;tgn,2016605" n="0.130 000000.7809	placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.112 000000.6735	placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;0.087 000000.5206	placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America">Bethel</placeName>, <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ladds, Marion, Tennessee" key="tgn,2479006">Belmont</placeName>, <placeName reg="Carnifax Ferry">Carnifax Ferry</placeName>, <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124364">Greenbrier River</placeName>, <placeName reg="West Branch Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,2758145">Alleghany</placeName>, and others, not to be dismayed and disheartened by reverses, but to make them incentives to new energy and fresh determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We shall rise, like <persName n="Antaeus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Antaeus,nomatch:0"><surname>Antaeus</surname></persName>, refreshed by every fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The farther the enemy penetrates into the interior and extends his line of march, the more costly and perilous will be his means of aggression, and the more economical and practicable our means of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Everywhere he will be met by desperate and prolonged resistance, until the foreign world, dependent as it is upon Southern commerce, would become impatient of the eternal contest, and itself interpose to put an end to the mad dreams of Southern subjugation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> This notorious politician has been lately edifying the citizens of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> with a speech in which he has demolished the doctrines of Secession to his own satisfaction and that of his audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>He has undertaken to prove that many of those who are now its advocates were formerly its opponents; but he has forgotten to state that <num value="1">one</num> at least of those who were formerly disunionist was an ultra advocate of State-rights, and that <sic>that</sic> man was <persName n="Segar,Mister,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="default:Segar,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Segar</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>He ought to give other people the same privilege of changing an opinion which he exercises for himself, especially if they <unclear></unclear> as honest and disinterested as any that account for his own change. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> It would become <persName n="Segar,Mister,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="default:Segar,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Segar</surname></persName> to bear in mind that he stands almost alone among the people of his own State in opposition to the right of Secession, and that those who differ from him are men whose characters in all the relations of politics, society, and life, are above reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Whatever may have been the opinions of men at <num value="1">one</num> time about Secession, there is no difference of opinion among honest men as to the duty of resistance to tyrants, and the man who, in times like these, becomes the willing tool of a despot against the rights and liberties of his own State, need not expect to cover his own tracks and escape public obloquy by raking up old political questions which are practically settled beyond the reach of such as he to overturn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> The point to which the enemy mainly directed his fire was near the <rs>South</rs> end of the island, where the <rs type="place">Sound</rs> is about <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="3">three</num>-quarter miles wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>A row of piles had been driven and extended within <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile of <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, and about <placeName><distance reg="1.5mile">one mile and a half</distance> of Croatian</placeName>, which is opposite.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/> <hi rend="italics">Gentlemen of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>:</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/> I return to you my sincere thanks for the honor you have done me, in selecting me to preside over your deliberations, during this the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Congress under our permanent Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>And I desire to say that it will be my <num value="1">one</num> great aim, in discharging the duties of this office, so to conduct myself as to show to you and to the world that your confidence has not been altogether misapplied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/> I may be permitted to say that I have a firm determination, so far as I may be able, to maintain the dignity and preserve the decorum of this body; to administer its rules with firmness and courtesy, and to conduct its business with strict impartiality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> If such a determination, united with a sincere desire to see our legislation take such shape as will best tend to secure the independence, maintain the honor, and advance the welfare of this entire Confederacy &mdash; if this could command success, I am sure I might expect to succeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/> But other qualifications are requisite, about which it is not for me to promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>If in anything I may tail short, I trust that the same kind partiality which has called me to this position will throw the mantle of charity over my defects, and will give me in every time of trial that kind co-operation and generous support which my deficiencies may require. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/> The unanimity with which you have made this election is a happy augury of the spirit with which your proceedings will be governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>This is no time for resentments, no time for jealousies or heart-burnings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Influenced by a great common purpose, sharing together the same rich hope, and united by a common destiny, let us hush every murmur of discontent and banish every feeling of personal grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Here let us know no man, save as a co-laborer in the same great cause, sustaining those whom circumstances may designate to go forward; seeking nothing for the sake merely of personal gratification, but willing rather to yield everything for the public good; <q>&#x0022;in honor preferring <num value="1">one</num> another.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/> That some of you, influenced by momentary impulse, should grow restive under the enforcements of those rules which you may make for your own government, would be a matter neither of surprise nor of complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>But he will prove himself either a weak or a bad man who; on reflection, fails to call back his wayward spirit and subject it to necessary restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>Submission to constituted authority is the primary necessity in all communities, and self-control is the chief lesson of individual life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/> In the light of passing events, we can measure the height and the depth of the excellence intended to be conveyed, when it is said, <q>&#x0022;Better is he who ruleth his own spirit than he who taketh a city.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/> The gaps of the world is fixed upon us. Nations look on, curious to see how this new system of government will move off, and what manner of men have been chosen to guide its earliest movements. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/> It is indeed a new system; for, though coinciding in many particulars with that under which we lived so long, it yet <unclear></unclear> from it in many essential particulars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/> When the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct> was put in </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/> operation, the war of the <name>Revolution</name> <unclear></unclear> been successfully closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Peace <unclear></unclear> throughout our whole land, and hallowed <unclear></unclear> its borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The industrial operations of <unclear></unclear> country, long held back, new bounded forward and expanded with all the vigor <unclear></unclear> frankness of tropical vegetation beneath <unclear></unclear> influence of a midsummer sun. The <unclear></unclear> which that Constitution had to encounter <unclear></unclear> its earliest as well as in more matured existence, was simply <num value="1">one</num> engendered by a conflict of these interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The question was whether it could give protection to all the interests without becoming the partisan <num value="1">one</num> and the oppressor of another; or, in <unclear></unclear> whether it has the sustaining power to preserve its integrity against the influence interest, wielded by ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>We have seen the result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/> The case with our Constitution is very different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>It is put in operation in time of <unclear></unclear> and its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movements are disturbed by <unclear></unclear> shock of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Its trial is <num value="1">one</num> created <unclear></unclear> the urgencies of this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The question to be decided is, whether, without injury <unclear></unclear> its own integrity, it can supply the machinery and afford the means requisite to <unclear></unclear> this war to that successful conclusion which the people, in their heart of hearts, have resolved on, and which, I trust, has been discreet in that higher court from whose decisions there is no appeal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/> The solution of this question is in the <unclear></unclear> of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>But our system <unclear></unclear> never perish out like that to which I have alluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>When ambition and interest <unclear></unclear> upon that, and destroyed its integrity, <unclear></unclear> were not allowed to appropriate the <unclear></unclear> altogether to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Fanaticism <unclear></unclear> forward, and demanded to be received <unclear></unclear> participant of power with them, and <unclear></unclear> claimed not in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>Beneath the sway <unclear></unclear> this unholy triumvirate justice was forgotten, intolerance was established, private morals were ruined, and public virtue perished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>All feeling of constitutional restraint passed away, and all sense of the obligation of an oath was forever lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The whole machinery of government degenerated into the absolute rule of a corrupt numerical majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Already the weaker section was marked out for destruction by the strongest and then came disruption and overthrow.--Since then, tyranny the most absolute, and perjury the most vile, have destroyed the last vestige of soundness in the whole system. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/> Our new system is designed to avoid the errors of the old. Certainly it is founded in a different system of political philosophy, and is sustained by a peculiar and more conservative state of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>It has elements of strength and long life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>But at the threshold lies the question I have already stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Can it legitimately afford the means to carry the war to a successful conclusion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>If not, it must perish, but a successful result must be achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>But it must be destroyed not by the hand of violence or by the taint of perjury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>It must go out peacefully, and in pursuance of its own provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Better submit to momentary inconvenience than to injured representative honor, or violate public faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>In the whole book of expedients there is no place for falsehood and perjury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Let us, on the contrary, assiduously cultivate the feeling of respect for constitutional limitation, and a sacred reverence for the sanction of an oath. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/> Seeing, therefore, gentlemen of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, that we are custodians of the nation's life, and the guardians of the <rs>Constitution</rs>'s integrity, what manner of men should we be? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/> How cool, how considerate, how earnest, how inflexible, how true!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Having no prospect in the future, save through the success of our cause, how regardless should we be of all selfish views and plans of personal advancement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/> Selected by the people to take care of the <rs>State</rs> in this time of difficulty and of trial, how we ought to dedicate ourselves in heart, mind, soul, and energy to the public service!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Neither history has recorded, nor song depicted, nor fable shadowed forth higher instances of self-devotion, than ought to be shown in the conduct of this Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/> It is not allowed us to pursue a course of obscure mediocrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>We inaugurate a Government, we conduct a revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>We must live, live forever, in the memory of men, either for praise or for blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>If we prove equal to the crisis in which we are place, we maintain imperishable honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>But if, on the contrary, we show ourselves incompetent to the discharge of our duty, we shall sink beneath the contempt of mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/> Truly our position is <num value="1">one</num> of great import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Our gallant army now holds, as it deserves, the first place in the thoughts and affections of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>But of scarcely less importance in the estimation of all, is the legislative authority which initiates the true civil policy of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and which sustains and upholds that army itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/> And when the latter shall have accomplished its holy mission by driving the invader from the soil which he desecrates and pollutes; and when the hearts of a grateful and free people, more generous than a <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Senate, shall for this service decree to <num value="1">one</num> life-long ovation, if true to ourselves and competent to their duty, this Congress will be united in the triumphal honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>And if this Constitution be desired to <unclear></unclear> forward, as we hope and believe <unclear></unclear> a distant future, gaining <unclear></unclear> from trial, winning new <unclear></unclear> time, giving protect on and peace to successive generations of happy and enlightened people, as the gray-haired <unclear></unclear> and venerated patriarchs of ages now <unclear></unclear> shall seek to inspire the courage, and fire the hearts of the ingenious youth <unclear></unclear> their day by recommitting the heroic deeds the army which achieved our independence let the lesson be extended and enlarged enabling them to tell also of the self-sacrifice, patriotism, and enlarged statement <unclear></unclear> ship of the <rs>Congress</rs> which inaugurated the permanent Constitution of this <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.
