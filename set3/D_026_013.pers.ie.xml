<head>The reward of virtue.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> The sages and moralists of ancient as well as modern heathendom, amidst their vague and conflicting ideas of religious truth, have held in common an idea which Christianity more definitely and authoritatively teaches, that there is a future state, in which virtue receives those rewards and vice those punishments which are not the unvarying consequences of either in the present condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>This universal sentiment of humanity, this ineradicable instinct of every human soul, must be founded in truth and have been implanted in the mind of man by his Creator to stimulate him in well doing and deter him from evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Yet that future, which is so near, seems so distant that fathomless ocean, strewn with a <num value="1000000">million</num> wrecks, from which only a plank separates, looks so like a remote firmament that it is necessary ever to remind men, from the schools of the philosophers and the pulpits of the sanctuary, that this earth is not his abiding place, and that the greatest business of life is to know how to die. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> There is no such consolation to struggling virtue, there is no ray of illumination to the mind which broads sadly over the evil in the world, like that which the hope of a compensating future casts over the perplexities and woes of the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is the lighthouse at the entrance to the harbor, which guides and welcomes the storm tost mariner, and gives him assurance of a foothold where the treacherous elements against which he has struggled can no longer disturb his security and peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In times of great public convulsions, when the waves and hurricanes of human passion are let loose to work universal havoc and destruction, the stoutest soul might recoil in helpless despair but for the sustaining conviction that a Righteous <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> occupies the throne of the universe, and that hereafter, if not here, virtue will receive its reward and vice its punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>There are times when there seems no earthly incentive to any man to do his duty; when self-sacrifice, toll, privation, and peril receive not even the miserable reward of ephemeral praise; when alone, unnoticed, unknown, men of whom the world is not worthy, walk the earth, feeding on husks that swine would reject, and performing the deeds of angels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>There are in the <rs>Confederate</rs> ranks, and have been there for <num value="3">three</num> long years, <num value="1000">thousands</num> and tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of pure and noble men, who have given up home, and every earthly comfort at the call of duty; who have been burned by the summer sun, and tread barefoot the winter snow, and faced fearlessly the carnage of a <num value="100">hundred</num> battle fields without the hope or expectation of emolument, of promotion, of distinction from the great mass to which they are attached, or of any human reward in any shape or form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>No <num value="1">one</num> knows them, no <num value="1">one</num> hears of them, their ragged garments are not even decorated with a badge of honor, and when their war-worn bodies fall, they sometimes remain unburied, and the forms which were once so dear to mother, sister, wife and children, and so long were the living bulwark of their country, become the prey of ravenous birds and beasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>And whilst the good and valiant thus suffer, the selfish, the corrupt, the mercenary and ambitious, are rioting in riches, indulgence, and glory!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>How dark and mysterious all this, when viewed apart from the light which the <rs>Future Life</rs> of Man throws upon his present existence! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> Let the inspiring thought that the reward will <num value="1">one</num> day come, and animate the humblest soldier that shoulders a musket in the armies of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>He who holds fast his integrity amid trials and temptations like those which beset the privates of a great army; he who preserves the purity he learned at his mother's knee, and can respect with a child's docility the prayers of his childhood; he who can do and die for others without reward, and scarcely gratitude, he, above all others, above <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, <rs type="role" n="President">Presidents</rs>, and <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>, may claim a country hereafter better than that which he fought for here, and rewards, compared with which, all the treasures and laurels of earth are worthless stubble. </p> </div3>

<head>The levy en masse.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> We have seldom seen more universal concurrence in the press of this country upon any <num value="1">one</num> subject than there is in its opposition to the desperate expedient of a levy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> of the population of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It is a confession of weakness not warranted by the circumstances of the case, calculated to create distrust in the minds of our own people of the extent of our resources, and has already given new encouragement to the hopes of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>To put boys of from <num value="16">sixteen</num> to <num value="18">eighteen</num> in the army is to destroy the &#x0022;seed corn&#x0022; of the population, as <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Oliver,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> aptly characterized it; and to force men over the age of <num value="45">forty-five</num> into the ranks is to furnish food for disease and death, and to crowd the hospitals and graveyards without adding appreciably to the strength of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/><placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, when beleaguered by the most colossal military power on the earth, never called men of that age from their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>At their homes they are good for something; there, they, and the immature striplings whom a cruel radicalism would devote to the perils of battle, may provide food for an army which is already pressing strongly on the means of subsistence, and, under State organizations render the only military service of which they are capable, the defence of the soil against raids of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Bring back the stragglers and the absentees, place negroes in the places of white teamsters, nurses, &#x0026;c., and we shall have as large an army as the people can feed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>What we need is skill and prudence in the development and husbanding of our resources, father than an increase of numbers look at the shameful manner in which Confederate property has been squandered, and the negligence and blunders by which so many of our men have fallen into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>These are the evils which must be remedied, and, as long as they continue, no increase of our strength will be of any permanent value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It will be like a new inheritance to a spendthrift, who will run through it just as rapidly as his former possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>What we want to see in Congress is coolness, combined with energy; and in the army, vigilance and discipline, united with courage. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
