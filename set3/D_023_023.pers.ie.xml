<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The statement made a short time since, that the great cause of the rapid depletion of our armies (says the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName>) was not losses in battle or sickness, but the desertion of soldiers to their homes in the <rs>North</rs>, has been widely copied and confirmed by a great number of journals in different parts of the country.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The most significant, comprehensive and momentous movements are on foot in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> touching the slavery question, in connection with the renewed prosecution of this war for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The late <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> sanguinary battles near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> will mark the inauguration of a new campaign and a new military programme, involving, in all probability, the completes extinction of slavery, at least in the border slave States, and with or without their consent, or compensation, as coming events may determine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last the members of Congress from the several border slave States, with a few exceptions, had a conference with the <rs>President</rs> at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, of a most important and significant character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>From the current reports upon the subject, we infer that these border slave State delegations called upon the <rs>President</rs> to persuade him, if possible, to apply a veto to the <name>Confiscation</name> bill which passed through its last stage of Congressional action on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>; and that the <rs>President</rs> answered their application by an urgent appeal to them in behalf of his well known policy of a voluntary, gradual, and compensated emancipation system in each of the border slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>In his original, and in a more recent proclamation on the subject, <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has made known to the country how deeply he is impressed with the importance to the border slave States of their immediate action in behalf of a compensative emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It appears that in this aforesaid conference he was more solemn, earnest, and impressive than ever in urging upon all concerned the advantages of instant action and the dangers of delay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> In this matter the paramount idea of the <rs>President</rs> is the fixed, absolute, and unchangeable separation of the people of the border slave States from the pro-slavery <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> politicians and people of the cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>He thinks that if the border States, each for itself, were to proceed now to the gradual abolition of slavery, as proposed by the late resolution of Congress, the cotton States finding themselves cut off from all hopes of any present or future border State support, would speedily surrender to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>In a word, <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> submitted this favorite scheme of his of voluntary and compensated emancipation to the representatives of the border slave States as the inevitable and imperative test of their devotion to the <rs>Union</rs> at this crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This appeal, coupled with the <rs>Executive</rs> warnings heretofore thrown out on the same subject, will, we dare say, be immediately followed by a systematic agitation in all the border slave States of the greatest interest and importance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> So seriously convinced were these members from those States of the necessity of action, as urged by the <rs>President</rs>, that on leaving the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> they arranged and held the same evening a consultation among themselves on the momentous question submitted to their consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It would not appear from this that there is much probability of a veto of the <name>Confiscation</name> bill; but, on the contrary that that bill will be approved and enforced, as a war measure, and that its operations may so disorganize and demoralize the slave population of the border States as to render slave property therein comparatively worthless and the institution no longer supportable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>And for all this <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has indicated the pressure of this gigantic war and the resistless current of events. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The border slave State representatives, it further appears, are resolved, in any event, to adhere to the <rs>Union</rs>; but they say there are difficulties in regard to the prompt action of their respective States, and doubts in reference to the compensation promised by Congress for a voluntary system of State emancipation, which require deliberate reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>These border State men seem to think, however, that if Congress were to apply this compensation policy to the individual owners of slaves, the question of emancipation in the border States would be settled at once, and in time to support the <rs>Government</rs>, as proposed by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, by detaching, now and forever, the <rs>Southern</rs> border from the pro-slavery schemes and dreams of the cotton States, and in favor of the free-labor system and institutions of the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>These proceedings, we submit, are too grave, deliberate and earnest to end in smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>In connection with this Confiscation bill they signify, voluntarily or otherwise, a great revolution in the whole structure of the local institutions, society, labor, polities and parties of the most prominent and powerful States of the <rs>South</rs>, if not in all of them Nor do we think that the apparent defeat of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> radicals in their late caucus at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> indicates a different impending state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>This Confiscation act is to our abolition radicals a substantial victory, in the possession of which they can afford to be silent upon mere abstractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>As the war continues, the chasm appears to be widened between our loyal and rebellious States, in the absence of a great and decisive victory; and we must work with energy &mdash; government, army and people &mdash; to secure as soon as possible a decisive victory at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, or we know not what may follow. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> We confess that we always entertained doubts of the truth of this proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They were so <q>&#x0022;solid&#x0022;</q> that no moral or physical lever seemed capable of moving them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We have seen the original of an old revolutionary document, in which the writer, a recruiting officer, complains most bitterly that, neither for love nor money could he induce any <num value="1">one</num> in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> to enlist in the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>What is meant by the term, is, we suppose, men of property, men who are solid in worldly goods and chattels, and we often associate physical solidity with the same terms; that is a rotund corporation and cheeks swelling with fatness, and those customary insignia of solidity, a gold headed cane, gold watch, chain and seals, and a substantial air, as of <num value="1">one</num> to whom a part of the globe belongs, and who looks upon all men not owning property as interlopers on the demeanes of the <name>Creator</name>, and who considers a plague, pestilence, or war, by which they may be taken off, the minister of a Divine Police, arresting loafers and vagrants and consigning them to a place where they can repent at their leisure of their poverty and worthlessness. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/> The present state of the campaign in <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> has been expected by every reasonable observer on this side of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>The event may prove to the <rs>Northern</rs> people that the <rs>English</rs> are not such prejudiced judges and ignorant commentators as has been asserted at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Ever since the beginning of this unhappy conflict, the crowning victory which was to restore the <rs>South</rs> to Federal supremacy has always been dancing like a Will o'-the-Wisp before the eyes of the <name>Northerners</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>It has led them through a boundless waste of blood and money, it has caused them to stir up batches which a century perhaps will hardly appease, and it now glimmers before them as deceptively as ever, while they are sinking slowly but surely into the slough of national disorganization and bankruptcy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/> When <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00446" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> called out his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="75000">75,000</num> men, the <date value="1862-07-04">4th of July, 1861,</date> was fixed for the termination of the rebellion, which was declared to be reprobated by a majority in every State but <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>That <date value="07-04">4th of July</date> came and went, and at no time since has the fail of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> been fixed for a later date than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> from the time of speaking; and now another <date value="07-04">4th of July </date> is upon us, and the <rs>South</rs> is still unbroken in strength and determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>All the power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has been put forth; a debt which no man accurately known, but which all suspect to be vastly greater than admitted, by the <rs>Government</rs>, has been contracted; men have been raised by the <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num>; <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has been put under contribution to furnish arms and stores and all the apparatus of conquest; <num value="4">four</num> main armies have advanced into the <rs>Confederate</rs> territory; half a dozen expeditions have fastened themselves on the coast, and yet the <rs>South</rs> remains unconquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>It is demonstrated that the <name>Federates</name> can only effect their purpose by a campaign far more gigantic and by an expenditure far more lavish than that of the past <num value="12">twelve</num> month. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> The present result of their immense exertions is that their gunboats control the great rivers of the continent, with the cities on their banks, and that their armies, besides securing <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, have military possession of certain parts of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>But it may, we think, be said with complete accuracy, that in these <num value="2">two</num> States the <rs>Federals</rs> hold only the ground they stand upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The hostility of the population in the neighborhood both of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00447" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00448" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> is admitted by every soldier in the <num value="2">two</num> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>In an enemy's country, which is desolated by the <rs>Confederates</rs> themselves, the <rs>Federals</rs> find themselves brought to a stand-still by the obstinacy of the <name>Southerners</name>, or, by the heats which begin their intensity about the time of the solstice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>The operations before <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> contribute nothing remarkable to the present news. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/> We are told of skirmishes which evince the boldness of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, of their cutting the telegraph wires and carrying off prisoners, of the reinforcements which continually arrive, and of the menacing attitude which they consequently assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>On the other hand, it is beyond a doubt that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00449" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> urgently demands fresh troops, which the <rs>Washington Government</rs> is unable to supply in numbers sufficiently large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Although the <rs>North</rs>, with the help of the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, has been able to raise an army truly enormous, yet these levies have been so scattered in distant expeditions, and in penetrating at so many distinct points into the great Southern territory, that the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, as <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00450" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s force is so called, is, in all probability, inferior numerically to the army which defends <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; while the reserves at the disposal of the <rs>Northern Government</rs> are more scanty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> The Federal <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> was, according to report, about to call on the <rs>Governors</rs> of the various States for fresh troops; and this fact, taken in connection with the season of the year, and the inactivity of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00451" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, seems to show that the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaign is likely now to languish until both sides have gathered fresh strength in the fall of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>The harvests of the <rs>South</rs> are likely to be reaped in peace by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and large supplies of food obtained for their armies as a reward for the policy which has led them, since secession, to substitute grain for cotton over a great extent of country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/> From the <rs>West</rs> all the news still has something of mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>We heard <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00452" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s masterly retreat, his carrying off all his sick and wounded, all his munitions and stores, and his disappearance no <num value="1">one</num> knew whither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Then we heard that this masterly retreat was a disorderly flight; that <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00453" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> was in pursuit, and had <measure n="10000" type="captured">captured ten thousand</measure> men and <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> stand of arms; that <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> more men had deserted; so that, in fact, the <orgName n="Confederate Army of the West" type="org">Confederate army of the West</orgName> was no longer in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>It is difficult to suspect <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major Generals</rs> and Brigadiers of absolute falsification, and we have so little knowledge of the facts that we cannot criticise their statements; but it is sufficient to say that <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00454" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, according to the latest accounts, still has an army of <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> men at <placeName reg="Okolona, Chickasaw, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057127">Okolona, in Mississippi</placeName>, about <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> from the frontier of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and that the <rs>Confederate</rs> force altogether exceeds <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> men. These numbers are, of course, merely guessed at. The <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> may be exaggerated, or they may be understated, but it is beyond a doubt that they are strong enough to hold that part of the country against the invasion of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>It is now reported that the <rs>Federals</rs> will form a defensive line from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, and abandon active operations during the summer months. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/> This state of affairs must cause deep reflection among men of every class, both in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>Happily, the people of this country, with the exception of an insignificant minority, have long formed their opinion of the war. They can see that if the <rs>South</rs> is to be subjugated and held by force of arms, this consummation must be preceded by the most savage and relentless contest in the history of mankind, and followed by a political condition to which even war might be considered preferable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>To impress this on the minds of the <rs>Northern</rs> people has been the object of the <rs>English</rs> press from the beginning, and the unanimity of <name>English</name> opinion may at length produce some effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>We have been right and the <rs>North</rs> has been wrong in so many things, that our opinion is, at any rate, entitled to consideration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/> We would, then, once more raise our voice against the indefinite prosecution of this horrible war. While the scorching sun is filling the camps with fever and cholera; while the youth and strength of the country are being hurried to the common frontier in preparation for a new feast of blood in the autumn; while the <rs>North</rs> is burdening itself with a debt concerning which even its rulers fear to speak plainly, and while the great staples of the <rs>South</rs> are being given to the names, we would ask the <rs>Federals</rs>, with whom the whole matter really rests, where is their conscience, where is their common humanity, or their boasted worthily prudence!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>They are in arms to enforce on men of their own blood submission to a rule that the latter detest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/> Although, for months after secession, the most eminent men among them, including the late <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> and the present <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, declared that the subjugation of <num value="1">one</num> part of the <rs>Union</rs> by another was a scandal not thought of, and that separation, though deplorable, could never be opposed by arms, yet the <rs>North</rs> now talks of conquest, and confiscation, and military colonies, with all the readiness of an Austrian commandant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>What becomes of the famous <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>What becomes of the theory that Government derives its powers from the consent of the governed, if the populations of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> great States, which, rich and poor, bond and free, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, are proved by events to be all of <num value="1">one</num> mind, are now to be invaded, conquered, and kept down by a standing army in the name of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> freedom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>These things must at last become apparent to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>They are not so unlike the rest of mankind, so unlike their former selves, as to dispute what is clear to the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>That the <rs>South</rs>, if it wishes to go, should be allowed to depart peaceably, is the only policy which is agreeable to justice and wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Unless the <rs>North</rs> can learn to see this, it must bring evils untold on itself, on us, and on every <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> people. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
