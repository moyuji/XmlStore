<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/> Little Willie was ever a kind and obedient child, always ready to sympathize with any <num value="1">one</num> in distress and to comfort them in any way he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Since early childhood he had a desire to become a Christian, never used bad words and would always reprove those he heard using them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>He had been instructed that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would never take him to Heaven if he was wicked in any way. He often talked about dying, and would ask his mother if she would die when he did. About an hour before his death his mother asked him if he was afraid to died to which he answered, no. She then told him he was going to Heaven to be with <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; upon which he asked her, when would she meet him in that <q>&#x0022;Happy Land&#x0022;</q> He then bade her and his father and the servants all farewell, and calmly and peacefully gave up his young and sinless spirit to his maker. </p> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;So fades the lovely blooming flower, </l><l>Frail, smiling solace of an hour; </l><l>So soon our transient comforts fly, </l><l>And pleasures only bloom to die.&#x0022; </l> </lg> </div4> </div3> </div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/> There are few persons who have a proper appreciation of the difficulties which attend an accurate compilation of the news of the day. We desire to publish none but reliable information, but in gathering this we have the same difficulties to accounter that others have to discriminate between, that which is well-founded, and that which is only seemingly correct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/> Yesterday was prolific of rumors, some of which have at least the merit of probability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The most important of these was <num value="1">one</num> which obtained currency late in the afternoon, to the effect that dispatches had been received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, stating that a general fight had commenced in the morning in the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>We visited the <name>Department</name> twice, to learn the correctness of the statement and the particulars of the engagement, but were unable to ascertain anything leading to a confirmation of the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The news under our telegraphic head, and an article published elsewhere, will furnish all the intelligence we have from the <orgName n="Army of the Southwest" type="army">army of the Southwest</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> Nearer home and around our own city matters are beginning to indicate something durative, and we may expect are long to be saluted with the hoarse mutterings of the dogs of war. From what we are able to learn of his operations, the enemy seems to be slowly and steadily approaching, and it is by no means unlikely that a grand conflict is about to commence within night of the antres of the <rs>Southern Capital</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/> A <rs type="role" reg="IsFather">son of</rs> <persName n="Lumpkin,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="mostcommon:Lumpkin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Lumpkin</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName>, who arrived in the city yesterday afternoon, states that the enemy in small force, made their appearance near his father's residence on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, but were driven back after a slight and indecisive skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>This is about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>-miles from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Again, yesterday morning, they approached the same locality, but a few well-directed shots from a battery that had been arranged to greet their approach, caused them to quickly disperse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/> Passengers by the <rs>Petersburg</rs> train yesterday afternoon report that <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName> has been occupied by the enemy, and that the train of cars from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> to that point has discontinued its regular trips to <rs n="Zuni" type="nativeamerican">Zuni</rs>, a point on the railroad some <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>We see nothing in this occupation of <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName> that has not been anticipated since the evacuation of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> by our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>We, of course, know not what is the intention of the <rs>Government</rs> with respect to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, but since its public annunciation of a determination never to surrender <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the impression has prevailed that at least an effort would be made to protect our lines of communication with the <rs>South</rs>, which would seem necessary for the maintenance of the large force which is now concentrated on the north side of the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>All conjecture is at fault, however, with reference to the military operations of our Government, and even after the consummation of its masterly man&#x0153;uvres it requires no little capacity to understand or appreciate their necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/> We have various reports from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, some of which we know to be reliable, but it will not be expected of us to state where <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> is, or what he is doing, or whether he and <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName> have formed a junction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The account which we have satisfy us that <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> has either to evacuate that section or meet once more in deadly combat the men whose homes have been plundered by the rabble which he commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>These men will fight desperately under the recollection of the wrongs they have sustained and the gross indignities that some of their families have been offered. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The telegram states that the indications portend a battle near at hand, and expresses the belief that the conflict may begin at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>That active operations must soon commence, we have no doubt, for it is scarcely probable that the <num value="2">two</num> armies, can maintain their present position much longer without a collision. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/> The infamous proclamation of the notorious Butter, which places the ladies of New Orleans at the mercy of his brutal soldiery, is said to have fired our army, and a feeling skin to desperation exists to drive back the minions of a Government that will tolerate such a representative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>When a fight does occur in the <rs>South</rs>, but little favor will be shown the invaders, and they will be met by men who feel that there is hardly a shade of difference between death itself and the ignominious life that would follow the success of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces in the impending conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Nothing inflames a man sooner than the invasion of the sanctity of his own home, and this threat of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Frederick,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s will so fire the <rs>Southern</rs> heart that in every future engagement the soldiers of the <rs>North</rs> will be met by men who will cherish a keen recollection of a threat which has no precedent in the history of modern civilization. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> A correspondent sends the following remarkable story to the <name>Dublin</name> <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Evening Mail" type="newspaper">Evening Mail</orgName>:</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/> This is the age of discoveries, and <num value="1">one</num> of such a startling nature has just been made in an <placeName reg="English county">English county</placeName> that it seems out of place in the region of sober fact, and to belong purely to the atmosphere of the <num value="3">three</num> volume novel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Mere are the circumstances, the names for the moment I am not at liberty to indicate: The <rs>Earl</rs> of &mdash; married not long ago, and brought his bride home to <num value="1">one</num> of the old family mansions which members of the <rs>English</rs> aristocracy regard with an affection amounting to veneration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>The lady, however, being more continental in her tastes, after a short residence in the apartments appropriated to her use, expressed a wish to have a <hi rend="italics">boudoir</hi> in the vicinity of her bed-room. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/> The noble <rs>Earl</rs> would gladly have complied with the request, but, upon examination, it was found that the rooms, as sometimes happens in antique buildings, were so awkwardly distributed that by no conceivable plan of re-arrangement could the desired <hi rend="italics">boudoir</hi> be fitted in. Thereupon it became necessary to invoke professional assistance, and an eminent architect was summoned from <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>He examined the house narrowly, and said there seemed to be nothing for it but to build <num value="1">one</num>, though at the same time he could not resist the impression that there must be another undiscovered room somewhere in that wing of the mansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>The noble <rs>Earl</rs> laughed at the idea; the oldest servants and retainers of the family were questioned, and declared that they had never heard even a rumor of its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The ordinary methods of tapping, &#x0026;c., were resorted to, but without effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Still the architect retained his conviction, and declared himself ready to stake his professional reputation on the result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/> The <rs>Earl</rs> at last consented to let the walls be bored, and, when an opening had been made, not only was the room found, but a night presented itself which almost defeats attempts at description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The apartment was fitted up in the richest and most luxurious style of <measure n="150years" type="date">150 years</measure> ago. A quantity of ladies' apparel lay about the room, jewels were scattered on the dressing table, and, but for the faded aspect which everything wore, the chamber might have been tenanted half an hour previously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>On approaching the bed the most curious sight of all was seen, and this is which affords the only clue to the mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The couch held the skeleton of a woman, and on the floor, underneath the bed, half in and half out, lay another skeleton, that of a man, presenting evident traces of violence, and proving that, before he expired in that position, he must have received some dreadful injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The secret connected with this tale of blood has been well kept, for not merely had all tradition of the scene faded away, but even the existence of the room itself was forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The survivors probably walled up the apartment at the time, and its contents remained hermetically sealed up till the present day, when, according to the best calculations, after the lapse of a century and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, daylight has accidentally penetrated into this chamber of horrors. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
