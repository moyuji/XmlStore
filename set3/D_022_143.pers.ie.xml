<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/> Desertion has become far too frequent in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>And yet the habit is not peculiar to Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>There must be desertions from all military service where there is no punishment for desertion.--We mean no punishment adequate to the offence &mdash; none which a coward or a vagabond had not rather encounter than endure the service or the perils of a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Death is the proper punishment, and it is the punishment prescribed in our laws &mdash; the punishment meted to the deserter by Governments generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>We anticipate that our own Government will be forced to resort to it. With a creditable humanity and forbearance, the policy of appealing to the pride of the soldier by advertisement, by disgraces, has been pursued by our commanders; but there is little pride and no honor in the deserter, and the fear of disgrace will not deter him from absconding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/> It has been suggested by a citizen that the community can assist to some extent in repressing the spirit of desertion by limiting the facilities to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The habit has been to treat every man wearing the uniform kindly &mdash; to feed and to lodge him. By questioning each <num value="1">one</num>, and requiring him to show his pass, or his discharge or furlough, the difficulty in the deserter's way may be increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Desertions may forge papers, it is true; but a little rigor in this respect will put them at least to that trouble; and they cannot all forge papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>It is believed in <placeName reg="Montour Falls, Schuyler, New York" key="tgn,2070618">Havana</placeName> that the <rs>Emperor</rs> designs placing <persName><roleName n="Prince">the Prince</roleName> <foreName>Maximilian</foreName></persName> on the throne of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and that with this view he has negotiated a treaty with <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, which power, in consideration of the elevation of <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName> to a throne, relinquishes the territories of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> to <persName n="Emanuel,,Victor,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="default:Emanuel,Victor,,,"><foreName>Victor</foreName> <surname>Emanuel</surname></persName>, and consents to a new boundary between the new kingdom of <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, which will give a satisfactory and permanent settlement to the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>This being the grand object of the <rs>Emperor</rs>, it is deemed politic to cultivate friendly relations with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, who, as nearest neighbor to his <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> monarchy, will stand between it and the once valiant asserters of the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/> In addition to these political considerations, there are others, of a commercial character, which, together, are believed to have determined the <rs>Emperor</rs> to lead in the recognition of the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/> The news is most too good to be true, though it is not without the endorsement of strong probability.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/> The presses of Lincolndom have recently manifested much distrust of the designs of the <rs>Emperor</rs>, and it is highly probable that much of the activity displayed of late by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, both in fighting and lying, has been prompted by their apprehensions of this step on the part of the <rs>French Government</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/> The deceased was the victim of a fearful and relentless disease &mdash; consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>For nearly <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> she had suffered the slow ravages of this disease, and yet in the midst of the pain, travail, and weariness of this long period, and the chilling prospects of approaching death, deferred from year to year, contrary to the expectations of her physicians, she was untiring in the active service and practical charities of her religion, and in the fulfilment of every earthly duty as a devoted wife, a stay and comfort to her aged parents, a fond mother, and an affectionate sister. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/> The duties of domestic life were discharged by her with rare fidelity, and every claim of natural affection was responded to with a warmth and depth of love as tender as it was faithful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>The natural virtues of her character, the humility of her religion, and the sweet graces of her manner and conversation raised up for her friends wherever she went; and among her last words were the testimonies of gratitude to those dear ones who had assisted with her immediate family in the last offices and consolations at the bed of suffering and of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/><q>&#x0022;Only to think,&#x0022;</q> she said, <q>&#x0022;that persons, almost strangers to me, should have been so kind.&#x0022;</q> Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, they were not strangers to her in those sympathies that make akin not through relations of flesh and blood, but through charity and experience and kindness, and the bonds of love in Christ Jesus the <rs>Lord</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/> It is not necessary to remind those who knew and loved the deceased of the gentleness, the patience, the grateful sense and the lovely manners that not only adorned the singular beauty of her youth, but survived, even unto the last, the pains and corrosions of slow and relentless disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>The <name>Christian</name> experience of the deceased, her glorious triumph in death, and the manifestations of the spirit of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to her departing soul, are lessons of mystery, of beauty, of awful power, of tender and eternal eloquence, upon which we would dwell, not blinded with tears, but looking up through sunlight and smiling skies, praising <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who turned night into day, and maketh even the mystery and shadow of death a light to all believes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/> The last words of the deceased which were plainly distinguished, as with slow effort they came from the lips, upon which already hung the cold dews of death, were, <q>&#x0022;Glory be to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> on high, and on earth peace, good will towards man.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/> With this p&#x00E6;an on her lips she died &mdash; through sorrow and pain and tribulation, through weakness and tears and great fires of affliction, triumphant at the last, made perfect through suffering, glorifying <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and dying in the everlasting arms of the <name>Saviour</name>.

<head>Armies contrabands.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/> We have before, referred to the organization by Federal <rs type="role" reg="General">Generals</rs> of the contrabands for military purposes, an already almost unparalleled, in all its circumstances, in the history of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Not content with despoiling the <rs>North</rs> of this, as of every other description of property; with enticing them from their comfortable homes and putting them in chains when they desired to return to their masters, they are now embarking in the horrible' business of putting arms in their hands and preparing them to shed the blood of their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>The solitary example of the <rs>British</rs>, who made such an attempt in their wars with <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, is not to be compared in atrocity with the present proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>This deed is done by men who still claim that both they and we are bound by the national compact which recognizes slaves as property, and who have always professed to regard the conduct of the <rs>British</rs> in the employment of negroes and <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> against white men as an abominable crime against humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Such it undoubtedly was, and still is, and yet the very men who were most obstreperous in their outcries against it, now, in their malignity and vengeance, resort to it with fiendish alacrity and joy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/> The condition of the negro in the <rs>South</rs> is <num value="1">one</num> which was brought into existence not by the <rs>South</rs>, but by English and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>They were the men who carried on the slave trade, who caused the negroes to be hunted in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, and brought to their ships, and who sold them to the <rs>Southern</rs> proprietors and pocketed the profits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>They owe their wealth and prosperity to negro labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Their manufactures, their commerce, their large cities, and the material greatness of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have all been built up by the domestic institution of the <rs>South</rs>, which has yielded to the <rs>South</rs>, however, only the bare means of subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>The condition of the slaves, in the hands of Southern masters, has been <num value="1">one</num> of greater case and comfort than that of any other class of laborers under the sun. They perform less work than the white laborers of the <rs>North</rs>, a fact which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves admit, who, in the present war, are making the contrabands work harder than they ever before worked in their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> they were more barbarians, cannibals, and but little removed from brutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>That they have been well treated here, is shown by their admirable physical condition, and by the rapidity with which they multiply, a fact which does not exist among the free negroes of the <rs>North</rs>, where the race is so rapidly dying out that, but for the fresh accessions by runaway negroes, it would long since have ceased to be. Moreover, it is not only their physical condition which has been improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>They have been civilized and Christianized, and that, to such an extent, that the number of negroes converted to Christianity under Southern influences is vastly larger than that which the combined churches of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> have succeeded in converting by all their foreign missions throughout the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Now, it is such a class of people, brought here by the <rs>North</rs> itself, and raised in the physical and moral scales by Southern hands, whom the <rs>North</rs> is endeavoring to arm against those from whom they have derived so many blessings! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/> It is idle, however, to dilate upon the horrible iniquity and brutality of such a procedure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Those who perpetrate it are prepared to hesitate at no crime whatever by which they can accomplish their ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>We should as soon think of pointing out to the murderer who demanded our money or our life the injustice of such a demand, or of reasoning with the tiger who was about to descend upon our sheep-fold, as to expect the <rs>North</rs>, from any regard for humanity or civilization, to desist from its fell purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>In this, as in all other circumstances of this unparalleled war, we rely alone upon Heaven and upon our strong right arms,--not upon their sense of justice or humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>We ask neither favor nor fair play, and do not expect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>But undoubtedly we shall take care of ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>The men of the <rs>South</rs> are prepared for any phase which this war may assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>They understand the negro race, and are prepared to deal with any position which they may be made to assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>They have shown that they are their truest benefactors and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>They can also show, if need be, that they know how to execute judgment and vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>They do not dream of treating as ordinary enemies the dependents of their own household who may be transformed into assassins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>It will be a day of darkness and tribulation for those poor wretches who may be enticed to raise their hands against their masters and their friends! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/> In playing this last card of disappointed cupidity and vengeance, the <rs>North</rs> is destined to find itself as signally failed as in its other plans of Southern subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The experiment made by the <rs>British</rs> in the same line proved a ridiculous failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>The <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> was fond enough of the pomp and circumstance of war; but they could never convert him into a brave and reliable soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>His sable checks blanched in the presence of the race whose superiority he had felt from the hour he saw the light, and whose hands were as heavy in retribution as generous in patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>What has been, will be again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have never understood the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>They believed at the beginning of the war that there would be a general insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Failing in this, they betook themselves to the enticement of contrabands from their homes, in which they have been successful, simply on account of the contraband's childish love of novelty and his favorite idea that liberty means nothing to do. As soon as they discover their mistake in this respect they are anxious to return to their old homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>The military organization will prove as impracticable as it is inhuman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>If it could be accomplished on a large scale, it would indeed lead to the abolition of slavery; but it would be by the extermination of the slaves. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/> The Empress has just adopted a new style of petticoat, which is the despair of nearly all the women of moderate fortune who are ambitious of bearing on their person in latest novelty that is to be found at the celebrated <hi rend="italics">mediates,</hi> of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00429" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>Her Imperial Majesty is not ambitious to popularize the <sic><hi rend="italics">agrements</hi></sic> of the <unclear></unclear>. She detests everything that is common, and lately begged of her fire woman to invent something in the shape of a petticoat that could not be worn by every <hi rend="italics">bour <unclear>guois,</unclear></hi>. That marvelous garment has been at last brought out. It does not altogether supersede crinoline, but greatly circumscribes it, and its peculiar virtue is, that get it up in the cheapest manner, it must be as dear as <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> ordinary petticoats, and cannot possibly be washed and smoothed for less than as many <unclear> francs.</unclear> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/> Petticoats are a very sacred subject, and in any case difficult things to treat of, but the <hi rend="italics">jupon Eugenic</hi>--that is a subject of serious disquietude to so many women &mdash; is particularly so. Nevertheless, so it is destined to limit that terrible bore &mdash; crinoline &mdash; to try and make public its peculiarities is a task that should be attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>Beneath a ball dress it produces an effect so charming as to call forth a torrent of the most flattering adjectives of which the <rs>French</rs> are capable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>It certainly forms a graceful contrast when its wearer dances, to the light skirts of some other lady coming in contact with the stiff steel bars of the cage she carries about her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/> This wonderful petticoat is said in most instances to be made of cambric muslin, so that washer women cannot stiffen it too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>Its circumference is <measure n="6yards" type="distance">six yards</measure> at the widest point, and it is covered by <num value="9">nine</num> flounces of still greater circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>The lowest of these flounces in by all accounts a more frill; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, a few inches longer and considerably wider; completely covers the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> does the same to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and so on till <num value="1">one</num> great flounce falls completely over the other <num value="8">eight</num>, each <num value="1">one</num> of which, to arrive at the standard of imperial elegance, must be hemstitched like a lady a pocket handkerchief, and the outer <num value="1">one</num> in addition be nearly covered with the embroidery done by the women of the <name>Vonges</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>This invention also sets its face against the <rs n="sewing machine" type="product">sewing machine</rs>, as nearly every part of it must be handwork.
