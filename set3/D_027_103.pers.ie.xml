<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Since the adoption of our last Schedule, for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>At this juncture, large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was, in a few days thereafter, to be taxed <num value="33">thirty- three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedule of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing, in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Therefore we assess the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules impressed since the passage of the currency bill, of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure>.--This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing officers and agents should forthwith </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> call on all those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis; but allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>- class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our <hi rend="italics">average</hi> appraisement of <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>, and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules and proportionately less for the inferior as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The county appraisement will be the guide in making these settlements, but within the limits of our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure> and our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>. This plan would perhaps be most satisfactory to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>For whatever price the county appraisers agreed upon should be deemed fair within the range of our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure> and our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>; payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issue of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should, in all such cases, themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> During <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the enemy threw across to the north side, at <placeName reg="Deep Bottom, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2280567">Deep Bottom</placeName>, a heavy column of troops, numbering from <num value="15000">fifteen</num> to <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>--some put the number as high as <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> morning a general activity was manifested along the enemy's entire front on the north side, and shortly after, they made a demonstration in force against our extreme left, on the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road, at a point about <measure n="4.5miles" type="distance">four and a half miles</measure> below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>We opened on them with artillery at long range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Their skirmishers continued to advance and engage ours, but were repeatedly driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Later in the day they made a show of advancing on our whole front, but were everywhere checked by our artillery and skirmishers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Our troops on the <rs type="place">Osborne turnpike</rs> had the satisfaction of shelling <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Our fire was heavy, and evidently effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The fort replied feebly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The cannonade, most of which was done by our guns, was very heavy, especially between <time value="3pm">three o'clock P. M.</time> and nightfall, and was intermingled with brisk musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>On the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road, throughout the day, the enemy seemed intent upon turning our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>They made repeated and very desperate assaults upon our lines at this point, but were each time repulsed with fearful loss in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>During the last assault, our men captured, in the ditch in front of our works, over <measure n="500" type="prisoners">five hundred prisoners</measure>, who, we are glad to say, have been safely landed in the <name>Libby</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>As at present informed, we are disposed to regard the movement of the enemy as a <hi rend="italics">heary</hi> feint; the real attack, if any, being on the south side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> So far, our advices from the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> are vague and unsatisfactory, being only such as are brought by excited passengers who came over on last night's train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>They report that a serious battle was fought yesterday, lasting most of the day, on the <rs>Boydton</rs> plankroad, <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> <offset>southwest</offset> of  <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>, and that the enemy, attacking our entrenchments, were <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> times repulsed with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They also report that <persName n="Dearing,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Dearing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Dearing</surname></persName>, of our cavalry, was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/><measure n="3000" type="prisoners">Three thousand prisoners</measure> and some guns it was likewise said we had captured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Though these accounts may be true, we cannot commend them as trustworthy until further confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We only know positively that, simultaneously with the demonstration or feint against our left, the enemy moved in heavy force against our right, southwest of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and we think, in the latter case, brought on a fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> It is also certain the enemy were in motion in <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s front, extending from the neighborhood of <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> Gap southwestwardly, and that there was a sharp skirmish there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The demonstration on the north side may have been a feint to cover the real attack on our right, beyond <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, or the whole movement of the enemy may be but a preliminary to more serious operations, to be undertaken to-day or hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> Our losses on the north side, in all the artillery firing and skirmishing of yesterday, amounted to almost nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>We have heard of only a few men wounded; and from the south side we have nothing we regard as authentic but the death of <persName n="Dearing,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Dearing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dearing</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> For the better understanding of the matter, I enclose copies of the communications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> You will perceive by <num value="1">one</num> of them that the writer has placed a number of officers and men belonging to the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, prisoners of war captured by the <orgName n="U. S. Forces" type="org">United States forces</orgName>, at labor in the canal at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap, in retaliation, as is alleged, for a like number of Federal colored soldiers, prisoners of war in our hands, who are said to have been put to work on our fortifications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> The evidence of this fact is found in the affidavits of <num value="2">two</num> deserters from our service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> The other letter refers to a copy of a notice issued by a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>, commanding a camp near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, calling upon the owners to come forward and establish their claims to certain negroes in the custody of that officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> The writer of the letter proceeds to state that some of the negroes mentioned in the notice are believed to be soldiers of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName> captured in arms, and that, upon that belief, he has ordered to such manual labor as he deems most fitting to meet the exigency an equivalent number of prisoners of war held by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and announces that he will continue to order to labor captives in war to a number equal to that of all the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> soldiers who he has reason to believe are held to service or labor by the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> until he shall be notified that the alleged practice on the part of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities has ceased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> Before stating the facts with reference to the particular negroes alluded to, I beg to explain the policy pursued by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> towards this class of persons when captured by its forces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> All negroes in the military or naval service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> taken by us, who are not identified as the property of citizens or residents of any of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, are regarded as prisoners of war, being held to be proper subjects of exchange, as I recently had the honor to inform you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> No labor is exacted from such prisoners by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> Negroes who owe service or labor to citizens or residents of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and who, through compulsion, persuasion, or of their own accord, leave their owners, and are placed in the military or naval service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, occupy a different position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> The right to the service or labor of negro slaves, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, is the same now as when those States were members of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> The constitutional relations and obligations of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to the owners of this species of property are the same as those so frequently and so long recognized as appertaining to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with reference to the same class of persons, by virtue of its organic law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> From the earliest period of the independence of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States it has been held that <num value="1">one</num> of the duties incumbent upon the several common governments under which they have, from time to time, been associated, was the return to their lawful owners of slaves recaptured from the public enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It has been uniformly held that the capture of abduction of a slave doors not impair the right of the owner to such slave, but that the right attaches to him immediately upon recapture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> Such was the practice of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States during their struggle for independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The Government under which they were then associated restored to the owners slaves abducted by the <rs>British</rs> forces and subsequently recaptured by the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> In the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the course pursued by the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> was the same, and it recognized the right of the owner to slaves recaptured from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Both the <rs>Continental</rs> and <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Governments, in fact, denied that the abduction of slaves was a belligerent right, and the latter power insisted upon, and ultimately secured by treaty, pecuniary indemnity from the <rs>British Government</rs> for slaves taken by its forces during the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> And it is supposed that a negro belonging to a citizen of a State in which slavery is recognized, and which is regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, were to escape into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, or be captured or abducted by their armies, the legal right of the owner to reclaim him would be as clear now as in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> being unchanged in this particular, and that instrument having been interpreted in the judicial decisions, legislative and diplomatic acts and correspondence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as imposing upon that Government the duty of protecting, in all cases coming within the scope of its authority, the owners of slaves as well as of any other kind of property recognized as such by the several States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, bound by the same constitutional obligations, considers, as that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> did, that the capture or abduction of a negro slave does not preclude the lawful owner from reclaiming him when captured; and I am instructed to say that all such slaves, when properly identified as belonging to citizens of any of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, or to persons enjoying the protection of their laws, will be restored, like other recaptured private property, to those entitled to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> Having endeavored to explain the general policy of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> with regard to this subject, I beg leave to state the facts concerning the particular transactions referred to in the enclosed communications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> The negroes recently captured by our forces were sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> with other Federal prisoners. --After their arrival it was discovered that a number of them were slaves belonging to citizens or residents of some of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and of this class <num value="59">fifty-nine</num>, as I learn, were sent, with other negroes, to work on the fortifications around <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> until their owners should appear and claim them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>As soon as I was informed of the fact, less than <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> afterwards, not wishing to employ them here, I ordered them to be sent to the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> By a misapprehension of the <rs type="role" reg="Engineer-Officer">engineer officer</rs> in charge, they were transferred to our lines south of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, but when apprised of the error, I repeated the order for their removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>If any negroes were included among this number who were not identified as the slaves of citizens or residents of some of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, they were so included without the knowledge or authority of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, as already explained, and the mistake, when discovered, would have been corrected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> It only remains for me to say, that negroes employed upon our fortifications are not allowed to be placed where they will be exposed to fire, and there is no foundation for any statement to the contrary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> The author of the communications referred to has considered himself justified (by the report of <num value="2">two</num> deserters, who do not allege that the negroes in question were exposed to any danger,) in placing our prisoners at labor in the canal at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap under the fire of our batteries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> In view of the explanation of the practices of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> above given, and of the statement of facts I have made, I have now, in accordance with my instructions, respectfully to inquire whether the course pursued towards our prisoners, as set forth in the accompanying letters, has your sanction, and whether it will be maintained? </p> <closer> <salute>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute> <lb/> <signed>[Signed] <persName n="Lee,,R.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="default:Lee,R.,E.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>,</signed> General. </closer> </div4>
