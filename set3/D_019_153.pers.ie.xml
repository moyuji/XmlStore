<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> The world does move, notwithstanding the tremendous efforts which have of late been brought to bear against its on ward progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>As an evidence of this fact, I may mention that the <orgName n="New York Daily News" type="newspaper">New York Daily News</orgName>, (the possession of which would, <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> ago, have been proof conclusive of a man's <q>&#x0022;treason,&#x0022;</q>) is actually offered for sale on our streets at present; and what is more, there are scores of men here who have the moral courage to buy it, and read it, and approve of its course in reference to the war policy of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It seems hardly credible, especially of the <rs type="place">City of Brotherly Love</rs>, but so it is, that only <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago I was informed by a news-vender that he was not allowed to sell the <name>News</name>, because it was a <q>&#x0022;secession paper;&#x0022;</q> and when, after a tiresome search, I found a young man who had the hardihood to risk his reputation and his business by keeping it, I could not help but smile at the suspicious look he gave me as he pulled it out from under a pile of papers, where he kept his stock concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> Indignation is vexing the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> to an extraordinary degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Their excitement with regard to the <name>Secessionists</name> is a cool offer vergence, like <num value="1">one</num> of their own serrated drinks, in comparison with the boiling wrath which threatens to over whelm our own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Happily there are many vents for this fermentation, and we may hope that not only will there be no explosion, but that public opinion will be eventually cleared and purified by the process. * * * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> The secret of the disappointment of the <name>Northerners</name> and of their strange display of temper is to be found, we think, in that constant disregard of international courtesy which has distinguished successive governments for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Elated by the rapid growth of their wealth and population; by their successful attempts on the territory of their neighbors, and by the knowledge that <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> depended on them constantly for cotton and periodically for food, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people have acquired a habit of petulance, and almost of insolence, in their dealings with foreign powers, which now affects their judgment &mdash; usually clear and sound &mdash; in questions of constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>It is the old failing of despots, whether on a throne or in private life, that they look on those who disagree with them as questioning their veracity or insulting their character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>So with the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>It seems to us, from all we can hear and read, that they really and truly believe that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is committing a most hostile act by refusing to treat the <rs>Southern</rs> privateers as pirated, and that the <rs>English</rs> press takes an unwarrantable liberty when it discusses the possibility of an ultimate disruption, or even speak of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Davis,President,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> as <q>&#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> It has been represented that the violence and captiousness of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> diplomacy during the last <measure n="20years" type="date">20 years</measure> have been the work of Southern politicians; but whoever planted or watered the bad seed, it has certainly grown up to full luxuriance in the <rs>North</rs>; for the opinions expressed on every side, and reported to be held by the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, are as unjustifiable as any ever advanced in the palmy days of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, accustomed to make their own interest and feelings the standard of international law, to repudiate whatever was inconsistent with their claims to universal dominion in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>, to support at <num value="1">one</num> time the claims of authority, at another the indefeasible rights of existing majorities, to cite precedents or to defy them, as it suited the cause they favored, are now, in all innocence and with full belief in their own consistency, holding within <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> <num value="2">two</num> opposite theories of their Constitution, and expecting <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> to change their views just as popular feeling in the <name>States</name> has changed. * * * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> The Government and people of this country have retained for the most part the opinions which the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> themselves held and taught us, up to the <date value="04-18">18th of April, </date> the day before the New York firemen changed themselves to Zouaves, and the <rs>Herald</rs> was forced to reconsider its principles by the appearance of a mob in front of its office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>If, before that date, any <name>English</name> member of Parliament, or any <name>English</name> newspaper, had ventured to suggest that the new <rs>President</rs> should organize a large standing army, blockade <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">3,000 miles</measure> of coast, and invade a flourishing region at the head of <num value="150000">150,000</num> men, what an outburst of indignation would have met the <name>Machiavellian</name> counsel!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>How we should have been reminded that a republic rests on the consent of the governed, not, like the old <rs>British Empire</rs>, on tyranny and taxes; that the <rs>Southern States</rs> were not a Hindustan, to be re-conquered in a twelvemonth; that the people of New York and other seats of commerce were not likely to make themselves cat's-paw to carry out <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s abolition schemes, by invading the planting States and encouraging lazy niggers to rebel against their masters!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>In short, it would have been triumphantly demonstrated that our sympathy for the <rs>Federal</rs> authority was only affected with the diabolical purpose of embroiling the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Yet because, from a sudden excess of patriotic feeling, the <rs>Northern</rs> populations are organizing a descent on the <rs>South</rs>, we are expected to forget all the decency and prudence of international intercourse, and join in hounding on the invaders!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> From Northern letters and papers written and printed in the prominent cities, we hear constantly of a revulsion in the public feeling, antagonistic to the present unholy war which a sectional party among them has driven them into, and we are led to believe that the prominent and moneyed men in those cities are using their exertions to bring about a cessation of hostilities, by the action of the coming Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Whether these men are actuated by a real desire for peace on the grounds of <name>Christian</name> humanity, or whether they are forced into some such measure by the immense monetary presence which is crushing them all, we cannot say; but are of the opinion that the latter is their reason for crying <q>&#x0022;Peace, Peace.&#x0022;</q> And we are strengthened in this opinion when we notice that all peace movements, such as we have referred, are confined to the large and principal cities alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>There the cry of want is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> raised, and the stagnation of business for but <num value="1">one</num> week brings to the surface and presents before the eye of the denizens of large communities an amount of suffering and starvation which was not known to exist in their midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It is also the prominent merchants and business men of the import marts of trade who are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pinched and ruined by such a war as the present <num value="1">one</num>, and therefore it is that now, although <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> have not yet elapsed since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call to arms was made, we hear of peace efforts in New York, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> Outside of large cities, however, this feeling does not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>There the hand of want has not been placed as yet. In the interior of the <rs>Northern States</rs> along the lines of public improvement and among the farmers, producers and miners, but little change is perceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>They have contributed nothing in the shape of money to the <rs>Government</rs>.--Their crops are ripening and are being garnered, promising a full and speedy return from the demand for breadstuffs created by the war. The mines are still giving forth their rich deposits of coal and iron, and the railroads and canals are working with their usual regularity and activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Here, then, the disastrous effects of the war are as yet unfelt, and the feeling which they call patriotism has not been drowned by the pinching hand of want. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> In the coming Congress the <rs>Representatives</rs> from the rural districts will be in the majority, and when those who shall represent more directly the large cities shall raise their voices for peace, as the only alternative to utter and continual ruin, they will be opposed by the interior men, who will not be able to fully appreciate the state of affairs represented by their city brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Thus we shall probably witness <num value="2">two</num> sentiments upon this question, and the majority will most certainly vote to continue the war. Money will be voted for the <rs>Government</rs> and men will be voted for the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, and the war will be pushed still more vigorously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>But when the money which is to be raised is drawn from the hard-earned and coveted means of the countrymen, then we shall begin to hear a voice for peace which will be listened to. Direct and heavy taxation will speedily tell upon their purses, and from the proverbial sympathy which exists between a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee's</rs> purse and his heart, no time will be lost by them to resume the security which compels him to open that purse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> We do not believe that the coming Congress will pass an act having the most remote bearing towards peace, and we should not allow any thought of such an event occurring to deter us in the least from our warlike preparations.--<hi rend="italics">Charleston Eve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Put on all your doors good house-door locks; then carry your key with you, or, if you leave it in the house, put it in a drawer, or some place where it is out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>If a thief sees a good horse go into a barn that has a lock on with which he is not familiar, he will go to the owner's house and stay all night, passing him self off as a traveler &mdash; all for the sake of getting a sight of his barn-door key.

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> Lastly, when you have a horse or cattle stolen, don't advertise; (I presume the editors won't agree with me here,) just telegraph to officers to tell them to watch for you. No <num value="1">one</num> is looking out for advertisements as much as thieves.
