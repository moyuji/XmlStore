<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Had they remained at the <rs type="place">Junction</rs> the enemy would either never have ventured to attack the bridges, or he would have been repelled without effecting his purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The troops sent up yesterday evening to reinforce those already at the bridge of the <orgName n="Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad</orgName>, marched to the depot from <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>, a distance of at least <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>, and when they had arrived found that no preparation had been made for transporting them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They remained at the <rs>Central</rs> depot an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, the officers of the road having received no intimation of any intention to send them on.--Such at least is the rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We know not whether it is true or not, but strict inquiry ought to be made, and the proper punishment awarded to the delinquent, or delinquents, in the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Of all other operations those of a military character are most dependent upon time, and can least afford to be trifled with. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> incursion and its Objects.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The object of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> incursion has now fully developed itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is <num value="2">two</num>-fold &mdash; to plunder and devastate, and to interrupt the communications of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> with this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They hope that by destroying the railroad bridges and tearing up the track they may effect a formidable diversion in his rear, which may induce him to weaken his army by detaching troops to restore them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>If <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> be the <rs>General</rs> that his deeds seem to proclaim him, he will not be diverted from his purpose by any such device.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He must have foreseen, before he undertook the enterprise in which he is now engaged, all that has since happened, and, doubtless, he has made his calculations accordingly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> It is a profound remark of <persName n="Napier,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Napier</surname></persName>, that all great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> make war alike Let us see, therefore, what <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName> said with regard to situations identical with that of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> at this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <rs>Baron Jamini</rs>, in his work upon the art of war, had censured the distant expeditions in which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was so often engaged, because they took him too far from his base, and exposed his communications to interruption in proportion as the line extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The book fell into the bands of the fallen <rs>Emperor</rs> at St. Helena, and in the memoire dictated to Gourgand and Montholore he triumphantly vindicated his operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He referred to the career of many great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, both of ancient and modern times, to show that in their most famous and most successful campaigns they had proceeded exactly as he had proceeded on the occasions called in question by <persName n="Jomini,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><surname>Jomini</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Thus <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName> set out from <placeName key="tgn,2057430" n="1.000 3" reg="sardis, panola, mississippi">Sardis</placeName> and marched beyond the gates of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName>, leaving behind him <measure n="1500miles" type="distance">1,500 miles</measure> of country &mdash; <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> marched from <placeName reg="Cadiz, Harrison, Ohio" key="tgn,2078690">Cadiz</placeName> through the <rs>South</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, over the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>, and through the entire length of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.-- C&#x00E6;sar made many marches in <persName n="Gaul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Gaul,nomatch:0"><surname>Gaul</surname></persName> which placed a vast extent of country between him and his base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A great General, he said, changed his base as he advanced, so as to have his magazine and resources a short distance in his rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>If his communications beyond the immediate base were interrupted, he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> disposed of the enemy in his front and then cleared the line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is a great General, and according to the axiom of <persName n="Napier,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Napier</surname></persName>, he will do as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> did, for, says the <rs>Colonel</rs>, as we have just remarked, all great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> make war alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He is also a profound student of military writings in general, and of course is well acquainted with the military views of the greatest of them all. He has already changed his base, which is no longer <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, but some point in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Any interruption on this part of the line, therefore, cannot affect his operations, because it is entirely external.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>When he shall have disposed of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, and otherwise completed the enterprise immediately in view, he will then clear his communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He could not expect that they would be left secure, upon so long a line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> further remarks that the communications beyond the immediate base cannot be protected by the army operating against the enemy, because it would require detachments so numerous and so strong as to render that army powerless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In general, he thought it best to leave them to the care of the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>That is what <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has done, and we should take care that they be protected as far as possible, until he shall have disposed of the enemy in his front. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The retribution.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> That there is to be a retribution commensurate with their crimes visited upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> we have not a doubt, as we believe in the justice of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We are inclined to the opinion that the present movement of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> will be the means of administering an instalment of the debt due to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Of course anything that the great man who commands the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> does will be done decently and in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He will not allow &#x0022;plundering;&#x0022; which, as a man of discipline, he knows is destructive to discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But we cannot, but believe that he recognizes that even-handed justice, which would commend their own poisoned chalice to the lips of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>,--and that, too, in a manner most advantageous to us and most injurious to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>While anticipating this, of course we could not expect a development of his own plan and mode of procedure until he had disposed of the defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Bombasts who hangs upon his right, and whom he would not leave in his rear without due attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> knowing the enormity of their own offences dread a righteous judgment, and hence their terror at the bare announcement that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had taken up the line of march towards their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>While he moves, the fires of our Southern homes and manufactories are illuminating our Southern skies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They may well tremble at every report of the ravages of the robbers and murderers they have sent amongst us. Yet <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is both deliberate and determined, and in the measures it may be in his power to take he will have in view alike a just retaliation and the safety and welfare of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We may confidently expect this from a man of his well attested wisdom and sagacity. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He would go no further than to pray for peace and restoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They put him on trial, and he made a defence which satisfied a majority of his flock, and the balance withdrew from his church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Outsiders, however, caught up the matter, and the press became denunciatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The <rs>Doctor</rs> at last yielded to the <name>Abolition</name> pressure so far as to publish a card, in which he declared that under the <rs>Providence</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> he had been born under the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and believing that Governments were ordained of Heaven, to that his allegiance was due and should be given, even to the extent of his physical powers if needed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> The people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> in the hurry of great events, and in the sense of almost absolute security which has been extended to the <rs>State</rs> by the strong arm of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, will probably never wholly realize how many horrors and losses they have escaped, such as have fallen with terrible and crushing severity upon other States, such as <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, so situated as to be made a part of the battle ground in the great conflict forced upon the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>When the signal for strite was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sounded here, when, by the sudden arming of traitors, the commercial metropolis of our State was all at once isolated, and in course of speedy preparation to be handed over to the chiefs of the great conspiracy, the conviction was for the moment forced upon the minds of all that here was to be the centre of the destructive tornade of civil war; that here must be the region destined, so long as the bloody strife might be prolonged, to be the very battle ground of the <num value="2">two</num> sections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Fortunately for us, however, the very highest interests of the nation demanded that its Capital should be permanently protected; that it should be made, incidentally, the great and effective barrier in this direction against those rebel armies which speedily threatened the whole border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>And so it was, that every national resource was strained to protect points <hi rend="italics">just south of us.</hi> To accomplish this, tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> wended their way <hi rend="italics">past</hi> our doors, to drive back the invaders at all approaches; whilst <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> being firmly held, gunboats and all the appliances of naval war fare were made at home in our spacious bay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>And still the war goes on, with its evils and its sufferings; but the blessed immunity from these ought not to make us so selfish as to forget our duty toward the <rs>Government</rs> and toward other suffering localities.
