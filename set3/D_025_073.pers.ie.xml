<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The position of the field on which it was fought is not indicated by the dispatch clearly enough to be accurately placed on the map. <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> flows northeasterly into the <sic>Tennesseee </sic> from the mountain slopes in the northeastern angle of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We infer therefore, that for the sake of a strong defensive position, and in order more rapidly to concentrate his forces, <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> fell back upon the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, and formed his line with such troops as had been at <placeName reg="LaFayette, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,2444045">Lafayette</placeName>, or within supporting distance of that place.--Other divisions arrived during the battle in column, and were deployed under fire to meet the rebel attack. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> It had already been intimated that <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> was to <hi rend="italics">assume a momentary defensive attitude.</hi> The immense importance of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, toward which the national forces were steadily pressing would not permit its abandonment without a desperate effort at defence, and here, as so often before the best and perhaps the only sound defence for the rebels consisted in assuming the offensive at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It is the resolute effort which the rebels never fail to make to <hi rend="italics">pierce</hi> the <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> line opposed to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Break through somewhere &mdash; at any cost of life, or of success at other points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Here also the attack is upon the flank, and its object is to cut off our forces at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, a purpose which if successful would equally have resulted in cutting our army in <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But it was not successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The momentum of the rebel columns carried them through at least <num value="1">one</num> weak spot in the centre, where <persName n="Cleve,,,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Cleve,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Cleve</surname></persName> and <persName n="Reynolds,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,nomatch:0"><surname>Reynolds</surname></persName> commanded, and apparently also carried at <num value="1">one</num> time the portion, or a part, of the portion held by <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>But the latter gallantly retrieved whatever disaster he may have suffered at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and co-operating with <persName n="Davis,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> on the right, drove back the rebels on the right and left, and recovered the ground which had been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>We judge also that the centre was regained by the same man&#x0153;uvre, since a repulse on either flank would have made it impossible for the rebels to maintain their ground, if they really held for any length of time the centre which they once seized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>At all events, either by this or some similar movement, the whole battle- field was finally regained, the rebels repulsed and pursued, and the line re-established along the river, just where the colors had been planted when the battle begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>We lost no general officer, and but few killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The casualties in wounded are numerous, but no estimate is given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Since, therefore, the rebels attacked, and the attack was beaten off, the day ended with a clear success for the <rs>National</rs> arms &mdash; such a success as yesterday or to-day may be expected to develop into a decisive victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The rebels can have no choice but to renew the attack, if they have strength to renew it; but, failing at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, they will remember <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> too keenly to be likely to succeed in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> attempt. </p> 
<p>
