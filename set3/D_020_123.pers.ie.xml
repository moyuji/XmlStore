<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The prospect of an immediate fight at <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> was gone; all hope of a skirmish even had been given out, and the place was fast growing blue with dullness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Nothing in the world was stirring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The fun and sport of camp life had given place to intense quiet, and soldiers moped around like children in the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The morning drills went off heavily and the remainder of the day was spent in starting at the coals, or in getting up <unclear></unclear> Their arrangements for personal commit in and around the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The wind whistled over the <rs type="place">Bull Run hills</rs> and across the valley, keeping up an incessant and weariness <unclear> ly.</unclear> Towards evening, however, a report came in that there was a prospect of something down on the river; and as the wind had died away, your <q>&#x0022;own&#x0022;</q> turned his home toward <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, in the hope of picking up an item or so for the benefit of his friend, <q>&#x0022;the public.&#x0022;</q> Just as the sun was setting behind the western hills, a solitary nobleman might have been <unclear></unclear> passing through <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, driving leisurely over the <rs>Centreville</rs>, and , enjoying the calmness of the hour and the beautiful scenery along the <unclear></unclear> The shadows of evening were list the posing into night as he swam his <unclear></unclear> and drove through the dense woods until the <unclear>m </unclear> appeared above the horizon, when he turned into a <unclear></unclear> to seek shelter and rest for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He met with a warm <unclear>re tion</unclear> and was <unclear></unclear> before a blazing fire dispensing news to an audience of eager listeners, and repeating stories to the small children and clustered around his chair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The ride from <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> was an agreeable <num value="1">one</num>, although made solitary and alone for there were companions along the route to keep pass away the hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>At this season of the year no <num value="1">one</num> who has an eye for the beautiful can fail to be pleased with all about him. As some <num value="1">one</num> has truly said, autumn with us is a <unclear></unclear> season; it is the carnival of a stare that ushers in the <q>&#x0022;tent&#x0022;</q> of winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> breath of autumn air is dearly welcome for it tells us that the burning heat of summer is over, and that it brings a healthful temperature to counteract the lassitude produced by the <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> sun. It is the <unclear>har </unclear> of cool refreshing nights, with blue <unclear></unclear>, and stars that sparkle with frosty brilliancy, and days of golden glory and temperate warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We rejoice to watch from day in day the changes it produces as the frosts, that tell of the coming winter, grow more frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>As the autumn draws to a close how fully we realize the line some poet sings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> <q>&#x0022;How like a monarch regal Autumn dies&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The forests do not perish with us as in other countries, but they gradually give up their summer green for richer and more varied lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>After the harvest moon the woodland is the theatre of a masquerade more Brilliant than that of carnival weeks in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, or of any the old world pageants royalty has established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The maples come out in a suit of gold, the beech comes on the stage in sliver; the walnut figures in rich straw color, the dogwoods effect carmine; the pines and hemlocks retain their green, and every twig and shrub done some fantastic livery.--The oak, the monarch of the woods, comes out conspicuously in the revel dressed in royal purple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>With this gay scene carnival autumn glosen and lenten winter appears, <unclear>mel </unclear> only by the delightful <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> summer days, which, like a dream of pleasure past, comes to soften the trials f to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Autumn <unclear></unclear> <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> is not the sad season <name>English</name> poets <unclear></unclear> in melancholy reverse, but it is the brief period which contains the holidays of the year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> But pardon this digression &mdash; to my story again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>After good night's rest, morning found me in the saddle once more, and on the road to <placeName reg="Bacon Race Church">Bacon Race Church</placeName>, where <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s Legion is encamped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Being little acquainted with the officers of the <name>Legion</name>, I spent but few moments there, and then hurried to my journey's end. The sound of heavy guns upon the river caused me to push on more ' rapidly, and in less than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> was reached. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> On the early history of the town I know scarcely anything, and conversing with the <unclear>bitan's</unclear> who ought to be well posted in its local records, has added little to my slender stock of information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>An old lady <measure n="63years" type="date">sixty-three years</measure> of age, <persName n="Cannon,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Cannon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Cannon</surname></persName>, is probably the only person born in <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, who now resides in it. The old families have all removed, and their houses are either destroyed or are occupied by emigrants who have purchased them at a low price, and who struggle on from year to year against poverty and ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I have never seen a more desolate, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> forsaken looking town, not even in Bohemia, or on the steppes of <placeName key="tgn,7016657" n="1.000 1" reg="valahia">Wallachia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Once it was a place of some note, and bid fair to be a powerful rival of the port of <sic><placeName key="tgn,7007048" n="1.000 2" reg="haarlem,noord-holland,nederland,europe">Haarlem</placeName>,</sic> which afterwards became New York!. It was settled by a company of <persName n="Scotchmen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Scotchmen,nomatch:0"><surname>Scotchmen</surname></persName>, as its name would indicate, immediately after the settlement of <placeName reg="James Town, Sweetwater, Wyoming" key="tgn,7013808">James town</placeName> by the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> laid out upon the <rs>Potomac</rs>, but as the bay was capacious and, the river navigable for some <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, it was removed up the <name>Quantico</name> to its present location.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It grew very rapidly, and was soon the most important town in the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Long before the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> existed as an independent government, when <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was a colony of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> was a thriving place, and contained several large were houses, numerous stores, a church, a court-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In which the colonial records were kept, a jail, and other public buildings.--Gradually, as time crept on, the trade grew, and consequently new ware houses and stores were erected.--When <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> was called <persName n="Haven,,Bell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Haven,Bell,,,"><foreName>Bell</foreName> <surname>Haven</surname></persName>, this was the great trading port of the country, and merchants were accustomed to purchase their goods here, and the country farmers for many miles, throughout the counties of <placeName reg="London county">London</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 52" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName>, and still beyond even, brought their grain and tobacco for <unclear></unclear> It became an incorporated town; it was made a port of entry; it carried on an extensive trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and vessels of the largest <num value="6">six</num> loaded and discharged their cargoes at its wharves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Ships were built and launched upon the shores of the <name>Quantico</name>.--In proportion to its increase of commercial wealth, grew the prosperity of its people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Elegant private residences were built; the stores were enlarged and multiplied; there came new factories and mills; a bank was chartered, and to show how the tastes were developed with their increasing wealth a flue brick theatre and another church were erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This was in <dateStruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></dateStruct>, at which time <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> was in a very prosperous and promising condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There seems to have been considerable wealth among the people, who were public spirited and liberal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They encouraged commerce, agriculture, and learning, and while they grew rich in the pocket, did not hesitate to give liberally for the support of schools and other public institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>At last the <placeName reg="old Court-House">old Court-House</placeName> became too shabby and small for the elegant town of <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> &mdash; almost a rival of its <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scottish</rs> namesake &mdash; and brick and corner stones were imported to build a new <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>There were more than <num value="60">sixty</num> stores on the main street, and sometimes the school children had a hard task to get through it for the many wagons and carriages that crowded it even up to the shop doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Huge barrels of tobacco stood on every side, and the drays were continually occupied in hauling it to the ship, while the creaking of the cranes, as it was swung on board, was heard all day long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, the vessels would spread their sails and go out to sea, perhaps never to return again, and their place alongside the wharves would be occupied by some new comer from across the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Those were white-letter days for poor <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, alas ! that they exist no longer! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> When the country around became cultivated and settled quite thickly, it was found that the freshet and heavy rains were washing the soft soil into the river, and that it was gradually being filled up. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <num value="1">one</num> and then another of the wharves and warehouses were rendered worthless from this cause, and so rapidly did the land encroach upon the stream that it became a source of much alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was well known that fine harbors had been completely filled up, and that the islands of the sea had been washed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The phenomenon of land changing its position was known and consequently dreaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We read in history of terrible inroads by the sea, and of new island covered with vegetation, being formed upon coral reefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I remember, the set washed away several acres of the island of Langrode in the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> Ocean, taking in the church-yard and many private residences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The same year the bar at the mouth of the <name>Weser</name> grew several feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Little by little the harbor of <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> was closed up until it became impossible for a vessel to get into the river, and those of light tonnage even were forced to lay off in the bay, until finally the bay itself became shallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>This was the turning point <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> in the fortune of <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, and thereafter its prosperity declined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> In the meantime, however, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution broke out, and of course crippled the trade of the town, causing a high old panic among the thriving merchants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It suffered somewhat from the war, and was shelled by the <orgName n="British fleet" type="fleet">British fleet</orgName> from the <rs>Potomac</rs>, fragments of the projectiles being occasionally found at this late date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Whether it was ever occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>I cannot say. After the war, new and better harbors were discovered, new towns built and new channels for foreign trade opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Capital will go wherever there is a chance for investment, and the wealthy traders of <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, closed their shops, and, taking up their <persName n="Penates,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Penates,nomatch:0"><surname>Penates</surname></persName>, bid farewell to the old town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> After this, disaster followed disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The houses were deserted, and soon went to ruin; the stores were labelled <q>&#x0022;to let,&#x0022;</q> and followed fast in the same way. In <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct> or &#x0027;<num value="47">47</num> there was a large fire which destroyed all the lower portion of the town, and time and neglect has nearly carried away the upper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The once busy town has become a ruined burg; the elegant <rs>Dumfries</rs> about as sorry a place as any <num value="1">one</num> cares to see. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Of its present appearance I will try and give some idea in my next, but my candle admonishes me to draw this letter to a close.--Candles are scarce, at <measure n="20cents" type="currency">20 cents</measure> a piece, and good old <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> light wood and fat pine splits cannot be found in this section of country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>I may say however, in conclusion, that the prospect of a battle here is very good, and Dam firmly of the opinion that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> designs attacking the batteries at <placeName reg="Evansport, Defiance, Ohio" key="tgn,2079480">Evansport</placeName>, and at the same time making a demonstration across the <rs>Occoquan</rs>.
