<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The public expectation that the battle in front of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> would be renewed on Monday or yesterday has been disappointed, and the appearances now are that the enemy will not again attempt his <q>&#x0022;on to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022;</q> march via <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Yesterday morning, when it was confidently anticipated and predicted that the day would not close without another bloody struggle, the community was astonished at reading the annexed dispatch upon the bulletin boards of the different newspapers of the city: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Headquarters near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, <date value="1862-12-16">December 16th, 1862.</date></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> As far as can be ascertained this stormy morning the enemy has disappeared in our immediate front, and has recrossed the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> I presume he is meditating a passage at some other point. R.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Nothing further was learned until the arrival of the train late in the afternoon, which brought down a confirmation of the dispatch, and the additional statement that they had stolen their dead from the field under cover of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>No better evidence need be desired of the completeness of the victory on Saturday than this sudden and unexpected withdrawal of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> from the south side of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is a frank admission of a defeat and, whatever his future movements may be, this <q>&#x0022;change of base.&#x0022;</q> will be regarded as a confession of the inability of his own forces to meet successfully those of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> A gentleman who came down on the cars last night says that great disappointment was felt among our troops when they learned that the enemy had withdrawn without a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time offering battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The general desire among the men was that the fighting should be continued until a decisive triumph was obtained, and they had not the slightest apprehension of the ultimate result of a general fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Many of the wounded in <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>'s fight, who have been at <placeName reg="Guinea's Station">Guinea's Station</placeName> and other points along the railroad, were brought to the city during the day yesterday, and distributed among the different hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Some of them were severely, whilst others were only slightly, injured; but all seemed to be cheerful, and evinced gratification that their blood had not been shed without advantage on the hills around <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>About <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> evening another train arrived over the same road with <num value="300">300</num> of our wounded and a train was expected last night with the remainder, and also another instalment of disabled <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The Central train also came in yesterday with <num value="90">90</num> disabled Abolition prisoners, and they report <num value="1500">1,500</num> of their comrades at the <rs type="place">Junction</rs>, making their way to this city under guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The arrival last night would finish all these whose condition required the advice of a Surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The wounded <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are loud in their praise of the determined valor of the men and all unite in declaring that they got the worst whipping at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> they ever and received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>When the result of the engagement becomes known this statement will no doubt be conceded to be true by everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Positions were, therefore, selected to oppose his advance after crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The narrowness of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, its winding course, and deep bed, afforded opportunity for the construction of bridges at points beyond the reach of our artillery, and the banks had to be watched by skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The latter, sheltering themselves behind the houses, drove back the working parties of the enemy at the bridges opposite the city; but at the lowest point of crossing, where no shelter could be had, our sharpshooters were themselves driven off, and the completion of the bridge was effected about noon on the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="2">11th</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> In the afternoon of that day the enemy's batteries opened upon the city, and by dark had so demolished the houses on the river bank as to deprive our skirmishers of shelter &mdash; and, under cover of his guns he effected a lodgment in the town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The troops which had so gallantly held their position in the city, under the severe cannonade during the day, resisting the advance of the enemy at every step, were withdrawn during the night, as were also those who, with equal tenacity, had maintained their post as the lowest bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Under cover of darkness and of a dense fog, on the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="2">12th</day></dateStruct>, a large force passed the river and took position on the right bank, protected by their heavy guns on the left. </p>

<head>Rivers as lines of defence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> It has been conceded, we believe, by military men, that rivers, in general, form but indifferent lines of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>It is almost impossible to prevent an enemy from crossing at some point on a long river, because if <num value="1">one</num> be guarded he may turn it, and succeed by a flank movement, where he could not effect the passage by assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>As a temporary barrier and a good place to make a stand, rivers nevertheless answer a good purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>But the instances in history in which great commanders succeed in crossing rivers with little loss, although powerfully defended, are innumerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The selection of the <name>Adige</name> for his line by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct>, may appear to conflict with this theory.--That, however, was an exceptional case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The <rs>Adige</rs> emptied into the sea, and as the <name>Austrians</name> had no naval force, it could not be turned in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Marshes impassable for troops with munitions of war extended from the <placeName key="tgn,7016532;tgn,1112500" n="0.005 000000.1030	placename;tgn,7016532;Adriatic Sea,Europe,Europe;0.005 000000.1030	placename;tgn,1112500;Golfo di Venezia,Europe,Europe" reg="Adriatic Sea,Europe,Europe;Golfo di Venezia,Europe,Europe">Gulf of Venice</placeName> within a very few mile-of <placeName reg="Verona, Lee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057702">Verona</placeName>, where were <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s headquarters and the greater part of his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Above the <name>Adige</name> flows through tremendous mountains, and these extend to within a few miles of <placeName reg="Verona, Lee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057702">Verona</placeName>, coming down to the very river, along which and on both sides run <num value="2">two</num> narrow, difficult mountain roads, which it was easy to guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>On the other side of the river &mdash; that is, on the same side with <placeName reg="Verona, Lee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057702">Verona</placeName> &mdash; was the <rs type="place">Venetian territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>On his left he was protected by the mountains, and on his right by the marshes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It was difficult, therefore, to turn his position, yet it was turned by a portion of the <name>Austrian</name> army under <persName n="Warmer,army,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Warmer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="army"></roleName><surname>Warmer</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, who came around <placeName reg="Lake Guards">Lake Guards</placeName>, while Warmer in person crossed it lower down with the bulk of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>But he saw that in effecting these operations, an enemy must so divide his forces as to expose them to destruction in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Events amply justified his foresight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>There were <num value="4">four</num> different attempts to relieve <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, and it cost <num value="2">two</num> large armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> It strikes us that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> made the same calculation in arresting the advance of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He knew that be could not prevent him from crossing, but he knew also, that his position was such that if the passage was made in front of him he could make him suffer severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>If it were made elsewhere he would be compelled to abandon his line of communication, established with great labor, or divide his forces, and thus expose them to destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Once on this side he would be compelled to fight him upon his own chosen ground, with a dozen other positions, all perfectly studied and understood, in his rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It is hardly probable that he could have prevented him, if he would; and it is not certain that he would have prevented him, if he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>All he probably could do, or wished to do, was to make him pay for his passage, if he wished to fight <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> &mdash; which we presume he did &mdash; it was surely much better to make <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> come after him than for him to go across the river after <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> We observe that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> already begin to compare <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s exploit with the <num value="2">two</num> passages of the <rs>Danube</rs> by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>--the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resulting in the battle of <unclear>E ing, </unclear> (the <dateStruct value="-05-21"><day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-05-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>,) and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in the <rs n="Battle of Wagram" type="battle">battle of Wagram</rs>, <date value="07-06">(6th July.)</date> There is a considerable difference, however, we venture to suggest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> crossing, in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, was not opposed at all. Half the <rs>French</rs> army had gotten over, when the bridges were destroyed &mdash; the <rs>French</rs> say by a rise in the <rs>Danube</rs>, the <name>Austrians</name> say by fireships launched by orders of the <rs>Archduke Charles</rs> &mdash; and they were attacked, with their backs to the river, by an Austrian force <num value="3">three</num> times as numerous as they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It was the bloodiest contest in which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had ever been engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It lasted <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, and resulted in the recrossing of the <rs>French</rs> into the <rs type="place">Island of Loban</rs> in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>This battle was called the battle of <unclear>E ing</unclear> by the <rs>French</rs>, and by the <name>Austrians</name> the battle of Aspera.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>If <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was not beaten, he came very near to being so. He says he retreated because the bridges were destroyed, and he could not receive reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The <rs>Austrians</rs> say he retreated because he could not otherwise says his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Be that as it may, there was almost as little opposition to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> passage at there was to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The <rs>French</rs> were in the <rs type="place">Isle of Loban</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>They had built several bridges where they had crossed before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The <rs>Austrians</rs> stood fronting these bridges and the river on the hills of the opposite shore, prepared to assault the <rs>French</rs> and drive them into the river as soon as they should passover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in the meantime, had secretly prepared floating bridges lower down, and in the night of the <date value="07-04">4th of July,</date> opening a tremendous fire on the <name>Austrians</name> at the point where the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bridges were constructed, he caused them to turn their whole attention there, while he launched his floating bridges below and landed a heavy force on their extreme left, causing them entirely to change their line of battle, which now faced down the stream, instead of fronting the stream itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>In neither of these cases was there much real opposition, or many men killed, whereas <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> suffered severely in the passage.
