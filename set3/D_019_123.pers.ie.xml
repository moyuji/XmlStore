<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Early on the morning after the election, (about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time>,) notice was given that preparations were in active progress for the occupation of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> of the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> came over with a flag of truce, and notified <persName n="Territt,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Territt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Territt</surname></persName> that the troops in town must surrender or evacuate by <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>. By order of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, commandant of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> forces, the troops were ordered to evacuate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Having done so twice before, the order was not promptly obeyed, our indeed was the notice sufficiently exciting to make them do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> In accordance with the <name>Punic</name> character of the <name>Administration</name> thus far, the <rs>Federal</rs> troops were burried in, and captured the larger portion of <orgName n="company"><persName n="Ball,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Ball,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ball</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>, and, it is said, handcuffed them, put them on board a steamboat, and marched them up to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and through their streets in triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>As remarked above, the capture of the troopers was partly the result of negligence, but more the result of the <name>Punic</name> faith of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> soldiery, it having been well understood, time and again, that the troops would have until <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> to evactate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Mistrusting the characters of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>, most of the troops collected and returned to the west end of the town, while the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> troops were not over <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure>, and might easily have had an engagement even with the small force of <num value="600">600</num>, without artillery, and having it well understood that no stand was to be made.--The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> troops, to the number of several <num value="1000">thousand</num>, formed in front of the river, under cover of the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs>, whilst the <name>Flying</name> <unclear>Artillery</unclear> came down by the turnpike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The Confederate troops retired in perfect order, and without any hurry, and having stopped the train about <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> from the depth, about <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> the cars left for <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The troops stationed in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> had to have the necessaries of comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There all had to be left in consequence of the shortness of time allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The troops are now here having left many articles of clothing and camp equipments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> It must be all right, now that delay has put us behind in preparation; but it galls <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> very much to have to yield their soil, even for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Trusting to the skill and bravery of our commanding officers, we hope soon to see the vandals driven from our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The vandals are driving out our citizens, whilst such men as Close, late of the <orgName n="Southern Protection Office" type="office">Southern Protection Office</orgName>; <persName n="Liggon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Liggon,nomatch:0"><surname>Liggon</surname></persName>, bookseller; <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName>, daguetreotypist, and other <q>&#x0022;Union&#x0022;</q> men are acting as special guides to the demons who hold reign in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Both journals have been discontinued, and the editor of the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> retired with the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>As yet the offices have not been destroyed, nor any special violence exhibited How much longer this will continue we can't sell, as the vandals declare their intention of holding the place for all time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The affair at the <rs type="place">Marshall House</rs> you have already heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Poor <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> fell like a hero, having singled out his man. He was asleep, when he was awaked and informed that a squad of the <name>Zouaves</name> had mounted his roof on the inside and seized his flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He immediately put on his pantaloons and shoes and met <persName n="Ellsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Ellsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ellsworth</surname></persName> as he came down with the flag in his hands, and shot him through with a double-barrelled shot gun, loaded with buck-shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The squad of Zouaves, close by, immediately fired upon him with <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> rifles, shooting him in the face, and stabbing him afterwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> P. S.--There are many other matters of interest which could not be put in this communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is reported since the above was written that a number of stores have been broken open, the <rs type="place">Mansion House</rs> seized and occupied, the depot books torn up and the safe rifled of <measure n="75dollars" type="currency">$75</measure>, the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> seized and the papers all burnt, besides a number of arrests made &mdash; among the rest, <persName n="Ashby,,Robert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Ashby,Robert,,,"><foreName n="Robert">Robt.</foreName> <surname>Ashby</surname></persName>, the merchant, than whom a better man does not live. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> In addition to the above, it is positively stated that a number of rapes have been perpetrated, and all the deeds which you might naturally expect from an unprincipled set of men who are following in their train. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>These facts are in the main fully authentic; the rest well sustained by current testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It will thus be seen that we must put out our whole strength, and humbly invoking the blessing of Heaven on our cause, advance to the rescue of our people, before the vandal hordes gather strength by our delays and overrun the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is no doubt that <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName> is the great end and aim of the set now sent upon us, and you may rely upon it the thieves sent among us will burn and pillage as they go, when they are fully under way. </p> <closer> <signed>Observer.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> I write this letter in a Lecture Room of old <orgName n="William and Mary College" type="college">William and Mary College</orgName>, and am surrounded by a number of <q>&#x0022;<orgName n="Young Guard" type="guard">Young Guard</orgName>,&#x0022;</q> who are, like myself, intent upon writing to the <q>&#x0022;loved ones at home.&#x0022;</q> Judging from the <name>Greek</name> quotation from <persName n="Euripides,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Euripides,nomatch:0"><surname>Euripides</surname></persName> which is boldly traced upon the black-board that swings from the wall of the room which we inhabit, this must have been the lecture room of the <rs>Greek Professor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <rs type="place">College</rs>, as your readers are aware, has been vacated some time since by the students and professors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The muses have fled, and the iron-eyed <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName> now rules over these classic precincts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Our Regiment (the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>) left the <orgName n="Central Fair" type="fair">Central Fair</orgName> Grounds yesterday morning about <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time>, and straightway proceeded to the wharf at <placeName key="tgn,2625188" n="1.000 10" reg="Rocketts, Henrico, Virginia">Rocketts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Not a member of our company knew his destination, and many conjectures were formed on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In sooth, we were entirely in gloom thereto, until the <rs type="place">Glen Cove</rs> hove within sight of <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>'s wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Our trip was a delightful <num value="1">one</num>, and nothing occurred to stifle the cheerfulness and contentment of the soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> We remained at the wharf at <placeName key="tgn,2625188" n="1.000 10" reg="Rocketts, Henrico, Virginia">Rocketts</placeName> about <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, waiting the storing of baggage and the systematic arrangement of everything that would endure to the comfort of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>At <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> the <rs type="place">Glen Cove</rs> left, and the huzzas of the men, and, that more touching tribute, the tears of woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>After a pleasant sail of some hours, we observed a body of cavalry drawn up near the northern shore to salute us. The noble fellows seemed to have ridden hard for the privilege, and right lustily did our gallant soldiers respond to their loud huzzas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Indeed, on either shore of the river, wherever there was a show of civilization, groups assembled to enliven us with their cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>We also observed several batteries in the distance, and the members of the several garrisons attached assembled to recognize us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Each member of the regiment, before his departure, was ordered to supply himself with rations for a day. Of course a regiment, the size of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>, could be but ill-victualled by the cooks of a steamer of as small size as the <rs type="place">Glen Cove</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Consequently those who disregarded the order of their superior officer were compelled to fast until our advent into <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> We arrived without accident of any kind at <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>'s wharf, about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>. After the disembarkation of the troops, the line was formed, and we commenced the march through forest and glen for <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The Life Guard and <orgName n="Henrico Guards" type="guards">Henrico Guards</orgName>, (<persName n="Dance,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Dance,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Dance</surname></persName>,) were detailed for duty at <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName>, and returned aboard the <rs type="place">Glen Cove</rs>, and probably arrived at their destination in a short time.--At <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> we entered <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, double file, and presented a fine appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The ladies turned out <hi rend="italics">en masse,</hi> and passed many compliments upon the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>May we deserve them the more in future!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>After a short repose from the march, we were ordered to <q>&#x0022;fall in,&#x0022;</q> and were soon snugly ensconced within the walls of <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The oldest and best banker, and the ablest financier in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; we might say in the <rs>South</rs>--is reported as saying that he sees the way clear through this difficult problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>A convention of the bankers of the <rs>South</rs> has been called and will soon meet at some eligible point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It will be <num value="1">one</num> of the most important convocations that the exigencies of the war has called forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Money is the sinews of war, and this convention will meet to deliberate on the high question of money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> This is certain, that there is no lack of the values in the <rs>South</rs> which command money.--The problem will be how best to make these values available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The single article of cotton presents an ample basis of value to support the whole cost of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> Besides this list, sent to foreign countries, we have all the articles which we have been in the habit of selling to the <rs>North</rs>, which did not enter into the tables of foreign commerce, amounting probably, exclusive of cotton, to at least a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of dollars.--In short, the values held annually by the <rs>South</rs> for exportation to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and to the <rs>North</rs> are not short of <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars, of which <num value="275">two hundred and seventy-five</num> or <num value="300000000">three hundred millions</num> are articles in such demand abroad as to be always equivalent to <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> Here is a basis of cash values which certainly ought to sustain any system of finance which the emergencies of the war may call into requisition; and the problem for the convention of bankers is, so to utilize these values as to render them available for the purposes of the war. Happily for the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, there will be no question <hi rend="italics">whether</hi> these cash products of the <rs>South</rs> can be used for the public benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Our cotton, rice, and sugar planters have long ago put that question to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>They have said to the <rs>Government</rs>, <q>&#x0022;take our crops; use, employ, convert them in any way you think best for the cause; we place them entirely at your disposal.&#x0022;</q> The Government, therefore, has only to take such portions of these crops as it may require for its purposes, giving receipts for the number of pounds taken, as evidences of indebtedness for future settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The financial convention has therefore no problem before it for solution, except the single <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend="italics">how</hi> to utilize the values thus placed at the public disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Probably no country was ever before so fortunate as the <rs>South</rs> in the possession of resources of credit so intrinsically valuable and so readily available for the purposes of finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>We expect an easy and perfectly satisfactory solution of this most important problem of the war, from the assembly of financiers about to be convened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The resources we have enumerated are those which the <rs>South</rs> possesses over and above the ordinary ones which belong to her in common with all other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>She has, besides these extraordinary values, her vast landed estate, her personality, and her representatives of wealth in all its ordinary forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>She has her <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of acres of land, <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num> of them improved; worth <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>She has personal property in various forms worth a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollar, exclusive of the value of her <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Had she no cotton, no rice, no tobacco or naval stores, no export values which all the world is eager to purchase with gold, she would still possess resources equal to the demands of the most costly and protracted struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>If, therefore, the recommendations of the financial convention about to meet be wise, and they be adopted by the <rs>Confederate</rs> and State Governments, we look for no trouble in solving the financial problem of the war.--Public debt will certainly have to be incurred; but the war will be a blessing to the <rs>South</rs>, competed with the weight and cost of that commercial dependence and financial vassalage to the <rs>North</rs>, which the <rs>South</rs> has been groaning under for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. The war itself will not cost more while it lasts than that vassalage would have cost the <rs>South</rs> during the same period.--We save by non-intercourse what we expend for the war. The drain under the vassalage left penury and paralysis behind; the war will leave independence, wealth, and blooming prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Capital, by hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, will then resort to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Enterprise will take up her abode in our land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>It could not well be otherwise, as the most dangerous enemy they have to encounter is the hot broiling sun on the tramp, and the serried hosts of brandy bottles and other condiments they meet after the conclusion of that fatiguing operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>In war, the thing is entirely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The several corps discard their cumbrous head ornaments &mdash; throw off the tight-fitting dress coat, and seek that comfort which is found only in clothes suited to hard work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>In former times we have seen some of our <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> soldiery have on their heads articles that would do most efficient service as fire-buckets in time of a general conflagration &mdash; made of leather of the most substantial character, and weighing <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num>, and sometimes <measure n="6l." type="pounds"><num value="6">six</num> pounds</measure>; every parade used up the participants to the extent of general exhaustion and a bad headache.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>This has always been a corn-growing State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The Northeastern section embraces some of the finest corn land in the county, <num value="50">fifty</num> bushels per acre being an ordinary thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>And now, owing to the war, and to provide against contingencies, the cotton and tobacco land has nearly all been put in corn, which, with fair yield, will supply us and <num value="2">two</num> or more States besides, while the wheat is said to be very good indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Probably <measure n="100000acres" type="area">100,000 acres</measure> of cotton land have been converted to corn culture this season, besides an almost equal quantity taken from tobacco, all of which will produce from <num value="3000000">three</num> to <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of bushels of grain, enough to feed <num value="100000">100,000</num> men <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.

<head>Imprisoned in Burma.<lb/>[<hi rend="italics">the conclusion.</hi>]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/> The life of a courtier, which every man must lead who would get on in Burma, was always hazardous, and the court itself by no means attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>The very harem of the king was composed of anything but beauties, and gave <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00326" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName>, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, a bad idea of the royal taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>He soon found, however, that the ladies were chosen for political reasons, as their very name of <q>&#x0022;Governors' Daughters&#x0022;</q> indeed implied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>When any nobleman is made ruler of a province, and especially if it be a distant <num value="1">one</num>, his nearest female relative is taken to the palace, as hostage for his fidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>For a considerable time, the indefatigable <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00327" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName>--making the most satisfactory bargains, and inaugurating, as he flattered himself, a most magnificent mercantile system &mdash; retained the royal favor, and was hand and glove with the aristocracy generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Once only he got into trouble about killing a sheep &mdash; for which offence, since the <name>Burmese</name> are forbidden to eat any meat but carrion, a poor peasant was soon afterwards <q>&#x0022;quartered alive, as he had quartered the animal&#x0022;</q>--but even this was got over by judicious bribery, and he subsequently obtained his mutton as in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Tharawudi</foreName></persName>, the heir apparent, becoming accessory after the fact, and daily sharer in the forbidden delicacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>Nay, he was even permitted to make a voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7001523" n="1.000 1" reg="calcutta,west bengal,bharat,asia">Calcutta</placeName>, whence he brought back with him a greyhound for the king &mdash; a good service, which placed him more fully in the royal sunshine than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>But the dark days of this too enterprising trader were drawing near! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/> No sooner did the war break out with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, than the feelings of the monarch altered towards him, and those of the court of course participated in the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/><persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00328" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName> was seized upon as a British spy, and upon the still graver suspicion of being the brother-in-law of the <rs>Honorable East</rs> <orgName n="Indian Company" type="company">Indian Company</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>The Burmese statesmen were seriously of the opinion that the H. E. I. C. had married <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00329" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName>'s sister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>On these charges, he was hurried into captivity, exchanging his sumptuous fare and scarlet finery (for he wore a complete harlequin suit of <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00330" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> tartan silk, by the gracious command of <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his majesty</name>,) for the unimaginable horrors of the <hi rend="italics">Let-ma yoon, toung,</hi> or <placeName reg="Death-prison">Death-prison</placeName>, its name, being literally interpreted, signifying <q>&#x0022;Hand!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>shrink not,&#x0022;</q> from the revolting cruelties practised within its walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/><q>&#x0022;Although it was between <time value="4">four</time> and <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> on a bright sunny afternoon, the rays of light only penetrated through the chinks and cracks of the walls sufficiently to disclose the utter wretchedness of all within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Some time elapsed before I could clearly distinguish the objects by which I was surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>As my eyes gradually adapted themselves to the dim light, I ascertained it to be a room about <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> long by <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> wide, the floor and sides made of strong teak-wood planks, the former being raised <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> from the earth on posts, which, according to the usual style of Burmese architecture, ran through the body of the building, and supported the tiled roof as well as the rafters for the floor and the planking of the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The height of the walls from the floor was <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure>, but the roof being a sloping <num value="1">one</num>, the centre might be double that height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>It had no window or aperture to admit light or air except a closely woven bamboo wicket used as a door, and this was always kept closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Fortunately, the builders had not expended much labor on the walls, the planks of which here and there were not very closely united, affording through the chinks the only ventilation the apartment possessed, if we except a hole near the roof, where, either by accident or design, nearly a foot in length of decayed plank had been torn off. This formed a safety-valve for the escape of foul air to a certain extent; and, but for this fortuitous circumstance, it is difficult to see how life would have been long sustained. * * * Before me, stretched on the floor, lay <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> hapless wretches, whose crimes or misfortunes had brought them into this place of torment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>They were all nearly naked, and the half-famished features and skeleton frames of many of them too plainly told the story of their protracted sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Very few were without chains, and some had <num value="1">one</num> or both feet in the stocks besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>A sight of such squalid wretchedness can hardly be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Silence seemed to be the order of the day; perhaps the poor creatures were so engrossed with their own misery, that they hardly cared to make many remarks on the intrusion of so unusual an inmate as myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>The prison had never been washed, nor even swept, since it was built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>So I was told, and have no doubt it was true; for, besides the ocular proof from its present condition, it is certain no attempt was made to cleanse it during my subsequent tenancy of many months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>This gave a kind of fixedness or permanency to the fetid odors, until the very floors and walls were saturated with them, and joined in emitting the pest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Putrid remains of castaway animal and vegetable stuff, which needed no broom to make it <hi rend="italics">move on</hi>--the stale fumes from <num value="1000">thousands</num> of tobacco pipes &mdash; the scattered ejections of the pulp and liquid from their everlasting betel, and other nameless abominations, still more disgusting, which strewed the floor &mdash; and if to this be added the exudation from the bodies of a crowd of never-washed convicts, encouraged by the thermometer at <num value="100">100</num> degrees, in a den almost without ventilation &mdash; is it possible to say what it <hi rend="italics">smelt</hi> like?&#x0022;</q> The furniture of this den consisted of rows of great wooden stocks, which, like huge alligators, opened and shut their jaws with a loud snap upon the arrival of each victim; and of a long bamboo, suspended from the roof by a rope at each end, and worked by pulleys, to raise or depress it at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>At night, the &#x0027;father,&#x0027; or chief of the jailers &mdash; who had all the ringbark branded on each cheek, which distinguishes the <name>Burmese</name> executioners.--caused this bamboo to be passed between the legs of each individual, &#x0027;and when it had threaded our number, <num value="7">seven</num> in all, a man at each end hoisted it up by the blocks to a height which allowed our shoulders to rest on the ground, while our feet depended from the iron rings of the fetters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>The adjustment of the height was left to the judgment of our kind-hearted parent, who stood by to see that it was not high enough to endanger life, nor low enough to exempt from pain.&#x0027; The other <num value="6">six</num> who were <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00331" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName>'s companions on the bamboo were the following: <persName n="Laird,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00332" reg="mostcommon:Laird,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Laird</surname></persName>, a Scotchman, recently kidnapped at Rangoon; the unhappy <rs>Rodgers</rs>, whose naturalization and long residence in the country could not shield him from the royal fury; <persName n="Judson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00333" reg="nearbymention:Judson,E.,Z.,C.,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Judson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Price,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00334" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>, <num value="2">two</num> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> missionaries, who were confounded with the <rs>British</rs> by ungeographical Burmese; and <num value="2">two</num> Hindu servants of <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00335" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>All conversation, even moanings themselves, died away among this wretched community, when <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> was proclaimed each afternoon by the palace gong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>A death like silence prevailed. &#x0027;It seemed as though even breathing were suspended under the control of a panic terror, too deep for expression, which pervaded every bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>We did not long remain in ignorance of the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>If any of the prisoners were to suffer death that day, the hour of <num value="3">three</num> was that at which they were taken out for execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>The very manner of it was the acme of cold-blooded cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The hour was scarcely told by the gong, when the wicket opened, and the hideous figure of a spotted man appeared, who, without uttering a word, walked straight to his victim, now for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time probably made acquainted with his doom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>As many of these unfortunate people knew no more than ourselves the fate that awaited them, this mystery was terrible and agonising; each <num value="1">one</num> fearing, up to the last moment, that the stride of the <name>Spot</name> might be directed his way. When the culprit disappeared with his conductor, and the prison-door closed behind them, those who remained began again to breathe more freely; for another day, at least, their lives were safe.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> Scarcely anything in the whole range of literature is more graphic and interesting than the account of this imprisonment; nothing in fiction approaches it for outlandish barbarity but at the same time for philosophical, almost cheerful resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Heavily ironed, witness to the tortures and death of others daily, and expecting them daily for himself; with no chance of rescue; deprived of everything he possessed, and dependent solely upon a certain benevolent Mohammedan baker for his escape from positive starvation &mdash; the fate of many of his fellow prisoners, from whom the jailers had filched the royal allowance appointed for them, and who had therefore nothing to look to but the donations of the charitable; filthy, naked, and, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, actually <hi rend="italics">chained to a leper,</hi> did <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00336" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName> contrive for more than a year to retain not only existence, but even hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>He had been permitted, by favor of the jailer's pretty daughter, to occupy for a time &mdash; in company with a legion of rats &mdash; a separate cell, where dysentery at length completely prostrated him, and brought him to death's door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Death, indeed, was written in his face </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/> when <num value="1">one</num> of the ringed nice men came in and carried him back again to the stiffing inner prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/><q>&#x0022;What could this mean.&#x0022;</q> thought he. &#x0022;I concluded that at last the government had made the distinction between my guilt and that of my companions, and that I had to die a felon's death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>They must be quick, however, or the last Enemy would snatch the prey from their grasp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/> &#x0022;Again I was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>I did not owe it to this; nor is it likely that any human being could guess the true reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>I did not myself learn it until some time after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>It was this: if a prisoner dies within <hi rend="italics">the walls of the prison,</hi> his funeral obsequies are performed at the expense of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>His body is rolled up in a mat slung on a bamboo, and deposited in the adjoining grave-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>If he dies <hi rend="italics">within the cells,</hi> his corpse is disposed of in a similar manner, the only difference being that in the <num value="1">one</num> case the cost of the mat is paid by the <rs>Government</rs>, in the other it falls on the keepers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>These men, judging from appearance that I might die that night, had an eye to saving the expense of the mat &mdash; a few pence at most &mdash; probably none at all, as an old <num value="1">one</num> serves for the purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> Neither <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00337" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName>, however, nor any of his <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> fellow-sufferers, were destined to die within the walls of Let-ma-yoon. &#x0027;On the <dateStruct value="-05-2"><day reg="2">second</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, our party, now <num value="8">eight</num> in number, again found itself assembled around the memorable granite block.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>What a ghastly group&#x0027;The matted hair, the hollow eye, the feeble gait, the emaciated frame, the filthy tattered rags &mdash; objects such as the sun never shone upon!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Around us the <name>Spotted</name> men gathered for the last time!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>I never cast my eye upon <num value="1">one</num> of their detestable ringed cheeks after this day. They were now armed with spears, and each held in his hand a long piece of cord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>Our irons were knocked off &mdash; for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time for <measure n="11months" type="date">eleven months</measure> I found my limbs free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>The sensation was ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I could hardly stand &mdash; the equilibrium of the body seemed destroyed by the removal of the fetters I had so long worn on my ankles, weighing full <measure n="14l." type="pounds"><num value="14">fourteen</num> pounds</measure>--the head was too heavy for the feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>This only lasted a short time, and I enjoyed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stretch of my legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>We were now tied in couples by the waist, <num value="1">one</num> at each end of the rope; a parquet, with a spear, holding the rein, just as children are seen to drive each other in their sports.--Off we went, we knew not whither bound, but conjectured by the manner of the men and their weapons, we were going to the place of execution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/> Instead of this, they were all driven away to another jail in the country, the condition of which would have made a prison inspector weep, but which was an Eden bower compared to their recent place of durance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Here, too, they would all have starved but for the faithful baker, who ran the <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> from Amerapoorah</placeName> daily, bringing his loaves with him. The reason of their removal was unknown to the poor wretches; they only guessed that it boded them no good, since they had incurred the resentment of Pacahmwoon, the new Burmese Generalissimo against the <rs>British</rs>, by whose orders the change had been effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>When the sluices were opened to irrigate the rice-fields about their somewhat elevated dwelling, it was inundated by vermin and reptiles of all kinds who wished to escape death by drowning, and each of the prisoners was allowed a stick to defend himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>A tally was kept of the number killed of these unwelcome guests, and of the cobra da capello alone it amounted to <num value="13">thirteen</num>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> <num value="1">One</num> day an enormous cage was wheeled into the enclosure and placed under their apartment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>This contained a huge lioness, who was not to have any food given to her for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>As day after day she grew more ravenous, and they heard her every roar and even her terrible breathing, but too well surmising that they themselves were doomed at last to be her prey, it is no wonder that the mind of <num value="1">one</num> of them nearly lost its balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>But the poor lioness died &mdash; starved to death &mdash; after all, and <num value="1">one</num> of the prisoners, fever-stricken, gladly removed into her deserted tenement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The Pacahm-woon had decided that the white prisoners, instead of being devoured, should be buried alive at the head of his army, for luck; and this would certainly have come to pass, but <sic>that that</sic> hero himself fell under the displeasure of his sovereign, and was happily trodden to death by elephants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/> Eventually, the success of the <rs>British</rs> arms compelled the surrender of <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00338" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName> and his companions from the <name>Burmese</name> government; and, as in the conclusion of a nursery-tale, they all lived happy ever afterwards and the good baker got rewarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Was ever nursery-tale stranger than this true history?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Did ever man in a book pass through greater perils and sufferings than this man really did, who is now alive to tell us of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>In his extreme modesty, <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName> apologises for having published this narrative, never having followed literary pursuits, and of the circumstances described having taken place so long ago. Setting aside, however, the intense interest of the adventures themselves, the book needs no excuse of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Its style is as easy as that of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Crusoe,,Robinson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="default:Crusoe,Robinson,,,"><foreName>Robinson</foreName> <surname>Crusoe</surname></persName>,</hi> while its reflections have something of the same simplicity and guilelessness; and as for the staleness of the subject, there is but too present a parallel now offered it in the treatment of our unhappy fellow-countrymen in <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>The <rs>Chinese</rs>, however, cannot urge the plea of brutal ignorance which might be used in the case of the <name>Burmese</name> of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago. <q>&#x0022;Some of the natives who had fled from the war, and were thrown into the same prison, give us marvellous accounts of the skill and prowess of the <rs>English</rs> troops, exaggerated by their own superstitious fancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>They firmly believed in our using enchantments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/><num value="1">One</num> of these convicts affirmed, that even our missiles were charmed before they were fired off, and knew what they had to do. He was standing, he said, near his <hi rend="italics">Tsek-kai,</hi> an officer of rank, when a huge ball of iron came singing <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Tsek, tsek,</hi>&#x0022;</q> which he distinctly heard in its flight, when, true to its mission, it burst upon the very man it was calling out for, the unfortunate <hi rend="italics">Tsek-kai.</hi> Those who have seen shell-practice, know the peculiar hissing noise made by the fuse in its course through the air, and can enter into the mistake of the wonder-stricken soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Our surgical operations, too, had come to his knowledge, but, with the ignorance of a savage, he concluded our surgeons amputated injured limbs only to repair and fit them on again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>He could not conceive any other motive for cutting them off.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/> There is <num value="1">one</num> lesson we may all learn from <persName n="Gouger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00341" reg="mostcommon:Gouger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gouger</surname></persName>'s volume, and of which we have most of us not a little need &mdash; not to bewail ourselves about small calamities, when such sufferings as these sometimes befall our fellow-creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/><q>&#x0022;When I look back,&#x0022;</q> says he, <q>&#x0022;on the almost unexampled sufferings of those <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, how light and insignificant do all the ordinary troubles of life appear.--When such arise, I have only to reflect, and be thankful.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
