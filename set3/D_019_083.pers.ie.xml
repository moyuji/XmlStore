<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> A few days since <num value="1">1</num> met a Chinese procession passing through the foreign settlement, escorting a young female in scarlet and gold, in a richly decorated chair, the object of which I found was to invite the public to come and see her hang herself &mdash; a step she had resolved to take, in consequence of the death of her husband, by which she had been left a childless widow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>We had scarcely arrived, when the same procession was seen advancing from the joss-house of the widow's native village, towards a scaffold and gallows erected in an adjacent field, and surrounded by hundreds of natives of both sexes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>A child in arms was then placed upon the table which she caressed and adorned with a necklace she had worn herself; she then took an ornamented basket containing rice, herbs, and flowers, and, whilst scattering them amongst the crowd, delivered a short address, thanking them for their attendance, and upholding the motives which urged her to the step she was about to take.--This done, a salute of <num value="3">three</num> bombards announced the arrival of the time for the performance of the last act of her existence, when a delay was occasioned by the discovery of the absence of a reluctant brother, pending whose arrival let me describe the means of extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The gallows was formed by an upright timber on each side of the scaffold supporting a stout bamboo, from the centre of which was suspended a loop of red cord, with a small wooden ring embracing both parts of it, which was covered by a red silk handkerchief, the whole lining being surmounted by an awning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> The missing brother having been induced to appear, the widow now proceeded to mount on a chair placed under the noose, and to ascertain its fitness for her reception, deliberately placed her head in it, then withdrawing her head, she waved a final adieu to the admiring spectators and committed herself to its embraces for the last time, throwing the red handkerchief over her head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Her supports were now about to be withdrawn, when she was reminded by several voices from the crowd that she had omitted to draw down the ring which should tighten the cord around her neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/> It is an old proverb of the <name>Spaniards</name>, and I think a good <num value="1">one</num>, that <q>&#x0022;wise men sometimes change their opinions, but fools seldom if ever do.&#x0022;</q>I am reminded of this by observing the persistency with which the abolition papers of the <rs>North</rs>, and the submission press of the <rs>Southern Border States</rs>, hold to the false idea that there exists in the <rs>Confederate State</rs> a party, respectable in numbers, in favor of a reconstruction of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>I assert it as an indisputable fact, that the citizens of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and especially the planters, whose cause is so tearfully espoused by the enemies of their Government, are as contented and happy as ever fall to the lot of men to be. <hi rend="italics">They are not ruled by mobs,</hi>as is mendaciously alleged by those who wish to rule <unclear>m</unclear> themselves, but are masters in their own right, and exercise every privilege appertaining thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The non slave owning whites, instead of ruling the planters, as they are said to do, are themselves, to a great extent, politically, dependent upon the planters, through their agents and factors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>Hence it follows that both interest and inclination prompt them to follow, instead of essaying to lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>There is no point in the <rs>South</rs> where Federalism ruled so despotically as it did of old in <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>; but now patriotism has usurped the place of passion, and crowded out every semblance of dissatisfaction with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/> No later than yesterday the editor of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">whig</rs>,</hi>(which paper has been an enemy to the new Government,) in acknowledging the compliment of the presentation of a Confederate State flag to his company, spoke in handsome and hopeful terms of the <rs>Southern</rs> movement, claiming for it a bloodless success, unparalleled in the history of revolutions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the many falsehoods now going the rounds to the prejudice of the <rs>South</rs>, is that <persName n="Houston,,Samuel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00862" reg="default:Houston,Samuel,,,"><foreName n="Samuel">Sam.</foreName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName> refuses to surrender his office to his successor, <persName n="Clarke,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00863" reg="mostcommon:Clarke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>. <persName n="Houston,Ex-Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00864" reg="nearbymention:Houston,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Ex-Governor">Ex-Governor</roleName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName> did, it is true, enter his protest against the action of the <rs>Convention</rs>, and subsequently, in company of <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00865" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="ex-Congressman">ex-Congressman</rs>, harangued the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> with the view of exciting their sympathies in his own behalf, but to no purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>He is now powerless for good or for evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>I mention this because his name is so often quoted by the submissionists as <num value="1">one</num> of the leading men of influence engaged in the &#x0022;reactionary movement.&#x0022;I conscientiously believe that if the men of the <rs>Cotton States</rs> were so craven-hearted as to desire a reconstruction, they would not dare to avow the fact, through fear of exciting the contempt and hatred of the women, who like the men, are true friends to the cause of Southern independence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> The <orgName n="Charleston Courier" type="newspaper">Charleston Courier</orgName> has the following relative to the stoppage of supplies to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/> The orders which some dispatches and accounts have been anticipating for several days, have now been issued for the suspension of all supplies between <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and the city.-- This step is not taken too soon, but, we believe, of the use and improvement we have made by the delay, we cannot say, with some, that it was deferred too long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>There is reason for believing that the reports of orders from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00875" reg="nearbymention:Washington,Fanny,,,"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> for evacuation have only been designed to deceive and beguile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> This, although an important step, does not necessarily inaugurate hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It will be remembered that the communications between <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and the city, for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> after the removal of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00880" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, was withheld from the garrison, and no supplies allowed to be furnished.
