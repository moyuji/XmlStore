<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>A gentleman who has been over the ground occupied by the enemy since their departure informs as that their fortifications consisted of <num value="6">six</num> paralleled lines, intersected in some places by transverse lines, as if they expected an attack in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>These fortifications were strengthened by legs, and the timbers, doors, windows, and even furniture of houses they had sacked and torn to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In erecting the breast works the negroes of the vicinity were pressed into service, their operations being superintended by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers.--Wherever there was a create of a hill or a clump of woods, the circumstance was taken advantage or, the fortifications being so constructed as to wind around for the purpose of protecting their front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The fields in advance of the fortifications are full of pits dug for the protection of sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Even of these pits is of sufficient dimensions for <num value="1">one</num> man to ensconce himself in, the front and flanks being guarded by breast works of earth and fence rails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In the farm kitchen numerous excavations are to be seen, and these were also used by the sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In fact, everything shows that it was <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s purpose to &#x0022;fight it out&#x0022; on <hi rend="italics">that</hi> line, relying upon reinforcements from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>; but the &#x0022;lion in his path&#x0022; and the demoralization of his men compelled another change of base, and hence the strong works were abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Various rumors, were in circulation yesterday relative to another advance of the enemy upon <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>We learned last night that at an early hour yesterday morning a force approached <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> by the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 1473" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName> road; were engaged during the day with our troops at <placeName><persName n="Dearing,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Dearing,nomatch:0"><surname>Dearing</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles distant</measure> from the city, and were driven back.
