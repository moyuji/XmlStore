<head>From <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.--the surrender of the town Demanded.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We present this morning such particulars as have reached us of the condition of affairs around <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, which, within the past week, has been made the chief theatre of army operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Early last week it became apparent that the main body of the enemy's forces were in the vicinity of that town, and the fact was developed that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> intended a movement from that quarter upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It is needless to allude to the movements of our own army consequent upon these developments and imprudent to speak of the preparations made to arrest the threatened advance of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>On Friday a demand was made upon the <rs>Mayor</rs> for a surrender of the place, and allowing citizen hours for the removal of the women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Of this summons the following extract of a private letter from a prominent citizen of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> contains fuller information than we have derived from any other source: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head></head> <opener> <dateline> <name type="place">Fredericksburg,</name> <date value="1862-11-22">Nov. 22, 1862.</date> </dateline> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> You will have learned from passengers the brutal character of the summons we received yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>At <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> <persName n="Patrick,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Patrick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Patrick</surname></persName> brought it over and handed it to the military, to be communicated to the <rs>Mayor</rs> and Council.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The delay in sending it to headquarters was such that the <rs>Mayor</rs> read it at <measure n="20minutes" type="date">20 minutes</measure> to <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time>. He at once wrote a dignified remonstrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The summons stated that the town having afforded stores and clothing to the rebels, and the railroad offering facilities to our army, this state of things could no longer be suffered, and unless we surrendered by <time value="5pm">five o'clock P. M.</time>, he would give <hi rend="italics"><num value="16">sixteen</num></hi> hours to remove the aged and infirm, when he should proceed to shell the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It was signed by <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, but stated to be by authority of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He promised when the town was taken to afford such protection to property and persons as the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has now determined on. This is not the precise wording of the promise, but its substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We regarded it of course as a threat of harsh, rather than a promise of mild treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our reply stated the impossibility of complying with the request, from the short time allowed and from the fact that they fired at the cars our chief mode of removing the women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We stated that we were authorized to say by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs>, that no supplies should be conveyed to the troops &mdash; that the troops should not occupy the town, nor use the railroad depot for military purposes, but that they would not be permitted to occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This was dispatched at <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> and at <time value="2am">2 A. M.</time> we were informed that they accepted these conditions and would not shell at <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, and invited another conference, which is taking place, and of which the train will bring you the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I have no idea they can cross, and my opinion is they may wish to embark on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>If not, their whole plans are entirely frustrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I am happy to say the town behaved with becoming firmness and dignity, and if the fates and the necessity of our cause demand the sacrifice of the only exclusively <placeName reg="Virginia town">Virginia town</placeName> in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, we are prepared to make it without a murmur. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The conference alluded to in this extract resulted in an extension of time for the removal of the women and children, and others not connected with the defence of the place, until <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time>. The work of removal was at once commenced and rapidly prosecuted, the trains arriving here on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, being filled with those thus suddenly deprived of their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Whilst the train which left <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> about noon on Saturday was leaving the depot, the agreement entered into was broken by the faithless enemy by firing several shells at it, <num value="1">one</num> of which exploded in close proximity to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Our latest advices from the town state that up to <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> the shelling had not commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>During yesterday it was alleged on the streets that the enemy were evacuating their position on the <rs type="place">Stafford Heights</rs> and moving back in the direction of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, but our inquiries did not satisfy us that such was the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There was also a report late in the evening that their gunboats had ascended the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> as far as <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal, in Caroline county</placeName>, and that they shelled that place yesterday morning, but this also lacks confirmation. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Operators have resorted to various expedients &mdash; such as blue vitriol, copper batteries, &#x0026;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The line of this company is now worked by a battery of <placeName reg="Sour Lake, Wayne, Georgia" key="tgn,2676260">Sour Lake</placeName> water. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The base of operations has been changed to Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, and the advance is to be made parallel with the line of the <orgName n="Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The whole of the army has been in motion for the last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> is before this held by the advance, with the army in close proximity thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This line of advance on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> has been advocated by <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> as the proper <num value="1">one</num>, and is understood to have been preferred by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> at the time the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> campaign was undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>A glance at the map will show the characteristics of the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Taking <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> as the starting point, from whence the army can be supplied by water transportation, the distance to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure>. <measure n="15miles" type="distance">Fifteen miles</measure> of railroad connects <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> with the <rs>Potomac</rs> at Aquia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This gives an additional base of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The <orgName n="Virginia Central Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia Central Railroad</orgName>, from <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, and the <orgName n="Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad</orgName>, form a junction at <persName n="Saxton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Saxton,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxton</surname></persName>'s, which is <placeName><distance reg="35miles">thirty-five miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName></placeName> and <num value="46">forty-six</num> from <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The army building this junction effectually controls the railroad communication from the north with <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, though there is still a round-about railroad connection between <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Against this, however, the rebels have the advantage of having their line of retreat fully prepared, with no bridges to build or railroad to reconstruct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We will probably have to construct Pontone bridges across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, but with the engineering facilities at <orgName n="command"><persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> this work ought to be completed by this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The condition of this once happy and beautiful <placeName reg="Virginia town">Virginia town</placeName> must excite the sympathy of every Southern heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It was the home of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> in childhood, the home of that mother whose elevated character and wise training prepared the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country for the great part he played in human affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It may be that the home in which she lived, and in which she trained her illustrious son for his lofty mission, that the very monument erected to her memory, have been demolished by the cannon of a people who owe to <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> their freedom and independence!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The town itself, though without commercial importance, has always been remarkable for the intelligence, refinement, and moral elevation of its community &mdash; We have never known a town so free from the usual vices of towns, or more distinguished for its hospitality and household virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Exile, desolation, and ruin are the fate with which such a town has been visited by this fiendish invasion, whilst the <rs>Northern</rs> cities, reeking with moral corruption, are exuberant with pleasure and gaiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the central fountain of all the bloodshed, misery, and crime of this inhuman war, is said to be the scene of extraordinary festivities, whilst innocent Southern cities are clothed in mourning and tribulation.

<head>The Massacre in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> We have forborne all remark upon the atrocious murders committed by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General, <persName n="McNeil,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:McNeil,nomatch:0"><surname>McNeil</surname></persName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 4898" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName>, until we could arrive at the exact truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>We published the statement of the enemy yesterday, softened, no doubt, to make the case as favorable to them as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Giving it all the credit which can possibly be claimed for it, it was <num value="1">one</num> of the most cruel, unwarranted, and unprovoked murders which civilized warfare ever brought forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>To find anything like it we must recur to the annals of <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and even they, in the highest fury of civil war, can scarcely present a case that surpasses it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The offence was this: A man named <persName n="Allsman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Allsman,nomatch:0"><surname>Allsman</surname></persName>, formerly a soldier, and of late a spy upon his neighbors, whom he was regularly paid to keep watch upon and to denounce to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> authorities, was seized and detained by a party of Confederate guerillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>There appears to be no proof whatever that he was put to death, although his employment as a spy upon his neighbors would amply justify such a measure of retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/><persName n="McNeil,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:McNeil,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McNeil</surname></persName>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commander in that quarter, forthwith wrote a note to <persName n="Porter,,Joseph,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="default:Porter,Joseph,C.,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, in which he threatened that unless <persName n="Allsman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Allsman,nomatch:0"><surname>Allsman</surname></persName> were returned by a certain hour he should proceed to execute <num value="10">ten</num> Confederate prisoners then in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>This was done by an officer of the same Government, whose troops never enter any place without hurrying off to prison all the male inhabitants, old or young, who refuse to take the oath, and whose bastilles are crammed to suffocation with civilians from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The man not having been returned, the assassin proceeded to execute his threats with all the circumstances of devilish cruelty that could suggest themselves to an imagination that revealed in crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Some of the unfortunate victims, we are told, were not killed at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire, and the <q>&#x0022;reserve&#x0022;</q> was called in to dispatch them with their revolvers! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> If the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> take not some steps to make reprisals for this damnable deed of blood, it should at least abdicate its functions, and give place to men who have the nerve to protect the lives of its citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>If the conscience of a ruler is so tender that he can not reconcile its promptings with his duty, then let him withdraw and give place to sterner and more callous men, better suited to times like the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The protection of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has been promised to the brave men in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, who are perilling their lives in our cause, although they are separated from us by the <rs>Mississippi</rs>; and if it be not accorded, the whole people of those States will be disgraced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government wishes to establish the doctrine that brave men, defending their homes may be murdered in cold blood by authority of law, and upon that doctrine they are now acting all over the country.--And we!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>What do we do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Why, we issue a thundering proclamation now and then, and withdraw it as soon as each particular atrocity begins to be less vividly remembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>In the meantime, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> burn and murder worse than ever, and we submit to it, as though they really were our lawful masters and we their rebellious slaves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> If the <rs>Government</rs> is afraid to take this matter up, we hope it will at once be taken up by the army and that they will exact a vengeance for this deed the very mention of which shall appal posterity to the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The combined <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> North <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, and <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, who fought and gained the battle of <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">King's Mountain</placeName>, hung <num value="19">nineteen</num> stories whom they found among the prisoners, and who had rendered themselves conspicuous by their atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>This example we hope will be imitated by our own armies, whether the <rs>Government</rs> sanctions it or not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> When <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Alexander</foreName></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, was on his death-bed, he said to the attending priest who was offering him the consolations of religion: <q>&#x0022;Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>father, kings have much more to repent of than private men.&#x0022;</q> And so they have, and so have all rulers, who do their duty as it ought to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The decision of life and death is constantly in their hands, and from that decision there is no appeal.--The man whose conscience is so tender that he cannot discharge a sworn duty, though it may save the lives of hundreds, or perhaps <num value="1000">thousands</num>, while it only involves the loss of a single <num value="1">one</num>, had best divest himself of his authority as soon as it may be practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Had a dozen <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers been hung in retaliation for the murder of <persName n="Mumford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Mumford,nomatch:0"><surname>Mumford</surname></persName>, we should not now be called upon to urge vengeance for the <rs>Missouri</rs> murders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>We see no remedy save that to which we have above alluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The army will be compelled to protect itself by taking the law into its own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> laugh at our blustering proclamations, and answer them by burning unarmed towns and murdering unoffending citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/><q> &#x0022;Blood will have blood,&#x0022;</q> in spite of all that may be done, or neglected to be done. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
