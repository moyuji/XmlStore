<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> Undoubtedly the most important occurrence this week has been the delivery of the decision of the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName> in the <rs>Alexandra</rs> case.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The real importance of this decision lies in the exhibition it affords of the wretched condition of the <rs>English</rs> law, and the still more wretched character of at least a portion of the <rs>English</rs> judiciary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>You will bear me witness that I have from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> placed the responsibility of this whole affair where it properly belonged, viz: on the shoulders of <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> <persName n="Pollock,Chief-Baron,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Pollock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</roleName> <surname>Pollock</surname></persName>, the presiding <rs>Judge</rs> of the <rs type="place">Court of Exchequer</rs>, where the case was originally tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The present only proves that I was right.--The whole case and its attendant circumstances are remarkable, and will bear recapitulation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> When the <rs>Alexandra</rs> case was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tried in the <rs type="place">Court of Exchequer</rs> you will remember what a <num value="1">one</num> sided charge the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs> gave to the jury, after which it was impossible for them to do else than give a verdict against the <name>Crown</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs>, however, distinctly assured the counsel for the <rs>Government</rs> that he would allow a bill of exceptions, in order that the case might be carried to a higher court; but when the <name>Crown</name> counsel tendered his bill of exceptions the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs> refused to accept and sign it, on the ground that his charge to the jury was misrepresented in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> Now, his charge was taken down, word for word, by the official short hand reporters of the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, and it is unreasonable to suppose that they blundered so outrageously as his lordship was pleased to allege that they did. It may be regarded as absolutely certain that they reported his charge exactly as he delivered it. He insisted, however, upon his own modified version of it, and thus left the <name>Crown</name> counsel without any tangible basis for his bill of exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs> then suggested an appeal, assuring the <name>Crown</name> counsel that there would be no difficulty about that, and that he might thus accomplish his desired purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>I have no hesitation in alleging that <persName n="Pollock,Chief-Baron,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Pollock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</roleName> <surname>Pollock</surname></persName> knew better at the time, and was perfectly well aware that no appeal would be sustained.--And I think that the only proof necessary to confirm this presumption lies in the fact that before authorizing the appeal, he compelled the <name>Crown</name> counsel to pledge himself to abandon the idea of a bill of exceptions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> In other words, the <name>Crown</name> counsel could and would have modified his bill of exceptions in some way, so as to have secured a new hearing, and it was this that the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs>, in his partisan character, was determined to prevent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>He, therefore, falsely and maliciously assured the <name>Crown</name> counsel of his right of appeal on condition of his abandoning, then and forever, whatever might be the result of the appeal, his right to introduce a bill of exceptions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The result is already seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The <rs type="place">Court</rs> to which the appeal was taken promptly decided that it would not lay, and a further application to the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>, the <rs>Court</rs> of last resort, has ended in the confirmation of that decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Here, then, is presented this singular state of things in reference to <num value="1">one</num> of the most important questions that can ever arise in the <rs type="place">English Courts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>A matter affecting not only national but international interests is tried and decided finally in <num value="1">one</num> of the lower Courts from whose decision there can be no appeal; and knowing this fact, but privately and willfully concealing it, the presiding <rs>Judge</rs> of that Court, by a trick, induces the counsel for the defeated party to waive his right to resort to the only measure by which a new hearing of the case, in the nature of an appeal, could be had. Of course the law itself is defective, and that is bad enough in a country that boasts of the perfection of its judicial system, but what are we to think of an <persName n="Judge,,English,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="default:Judge,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>Judge</surname></persName> who carries his partisan spirit so far as to lend himself to such a scheme as this? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The decision of the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName> was entirely upon technical matters.

<head>Raided and local defence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> The invader is aware of his great danger from the warfare called &#x0022;guerilla,&#x0022; in the sense of &#x0022;little war.&#x0022; There is another sense of the term which applies to his raiding expeditions, such as those conducted by the notorious <rs>Averill</rs>, viz: A predatory expedition, plundering and practising rapine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>But the enemy, with his usual art and inequity, attempts to evade the terrors of guerilla strategy, by denouncing it as barbarous, and threatening to hang all men found armed, singly or in small bodies, hanging about and harassing their march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/><persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName> made it a point whenever he entered a hamlet or passed a &#x0022;cross road&#x0022; to put up a handbill proclaiming the most summary execution of all guerillas taken along his route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He urged all citizens when he came about to go to their homes and there quietly to remain, as the best and safest course for them to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>His trick succeeded admirably well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He frightened off many who could have annoyed him terribly, and he took the citizens in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>His robbers visited the houses in succession, and its mattered not whether their occupants were sitting quietly and peaceably there or not, they were all robbed of everything desirable or portable, and in many cases what could not be conveyed away was destroyed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> This device of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> guerilla is a part of the plan pursued by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government of persistently enforcing the idea that they are engaged in maintaining the laws and we in violating them &mdash; that they are loyal and lawful people, come to establish order in <hi rend="italics">their own country,</hi> and we rebels resisting them, and that we are ever incurring the penalty of felons, forfeiting both life and property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> There is no reason why &#x0022;little war&#x0022; is less lawful than &#x0022;big war;&#x0022; and since the former is so much dreaded by the enemy, we should know how to profit by it at least by this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/><persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName> is already on <num value="1">one</num> of his raids, as it is reported, and he should, as should all the other leaders of predatory bands of invaders, be met by a vigorous system of annoyance and harassment from every eligible position along his route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>That is exactly what he most dreads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>He knows how it demoralizes his soldiers and how it imperils his march. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> The reserves of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> and Western counties may, by an efficient organization on the guerilla plan, strike more terror to the hearts of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> than many times their numbers consolidated and awaiting the enemy at some point along his route, hoping to draw him into a pitched battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>They could disperse in bands of <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="20">twenty</num>, <num value="50">fifty</num> or a <num value="100">hundred</num>, under commissioned officers, and seeking the heights along the enemy's route assail him when he least expects it, with well aimed shots from acclivities he himself cannot reach, and hurl down upon him stones that may wound his men and block his way. Such an attack from a small body of men, firing with such deadly aim as our mountaineers know how to take, would have a terrific effect upon him. It was chiefly by this kind of warfare that the <rs>French</rs> were driven from <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>There are instances of large armies being thrown into the greatest confusion by the assaults of small bodies of intrepid men occupying advantageous positions, and fighting in defence of their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> This sort of defence of the western passes would stop raiding in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.--The people there have found the folly of being intimidated by the threats of the enemy, and of running to their homes under the hope that they might in that way be spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>They were robbed as all others were, and no doubt now see that they can only obtain personal and individual defence and protection by combining with their neighbors for the common defence of all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> There could be nothing better than such a plan of defence as we speak of. The enemy in his raids is generally mounted, and moving with celerity turns the position of any large body met to intercept him. The whole mountain region is intersected by local routes, many of them mere horse paths, but such as would afford escape to an enemy amounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>And though it be possible to catch such a body of men in a trap, it has been strikingly illustrated by the history of <persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName>'s raids how difficult that is. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> The &#x0022;little war&#x0022; should at least become a sort of auxiliary to a large defensive force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>There need be no fear of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>He dare not put to death a soldier of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, acting under orders or not under orders, who with his few comrades had ambushed the foe and poured a deadly fire into his ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>No wonder that he dreads such on assault, and essays to evade it by his idle threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>That should only make us the more eager to resort to it. We hope to see the reserves organized with the view of carrying out this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The men of the <rs>West</rs> know their mountains and the passes in them, which give the power to a few gallant spirits to repulse a force very many times their number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The proper men, properly availing themselves of these advantages, may clear the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> out of the mountains and deter them from a renewal of their predatory incursions. </p> </div3>
