<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The armor of these vessels it said to be such that they will be invulnerable so the effects of any known projectiles, while their armament is said to embrace guns and mortars of the most approach construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>It is said that the power of this fleet will be such that they will be able to- day the entire city in ashes, but that they expect that, in order to avers this calamity, the city will be surrendered to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>And this is only the beginning of the exploits that are exploited of this new rebel navy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> No doubt there is much idle brag in all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>But it may be wise to provide against such an attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Intelligence from other sources has demonstrated the fact that the rebels are really having iron clad vessels built in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>'s ports.
