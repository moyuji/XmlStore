His appeal in tone and sentiment must inspire every mind with a kindred feeling, while his arguments are unanswerable: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The Border States.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> What does a new reckoning reveal as to the position and prospects of the <rs>Border Slave States</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> Now that a new Administration has come into power, and the policy of the future and results of the past can be known, let us survey the field and observe its salient points. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The Union already sundered, the position of the <rs>Border States</rs> is <hi rend="italics">new</hi> already, just as new as it would become by uniting with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The position reached by <hi rend="italics">drift</hi> is as full of new relations as though carefully selected, and entered upon of set purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>It is further evident that, amid all the changes wrought, no concessions have been made by the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Even the convulsions of dissolution have been unaccompanied by a solitary relaxation of any solitary pretension to usurped power on their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>It is, therefore, further evident, that even extreme necessity can procure no recognition of rights claimed in common by the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs>--seceded and unseceded &mdash; to the former secured, indeed, by disruption, but still unsecured by the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The position attained by drifting upon the current of events, is worse, indeed, than the old. The strength of the old Constitution has been tested and found wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The &mdash; so to speak &mdash; unnatural added strength of outside pressure, in aid of constitutional barriers, has railed likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The moral obligations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the threatened consequences of its breach, (the disruption of the <rs>Government</rs>,) have been alike disregarded by the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>She will not give up her hold upon ungranted jurisdiction, either for conscience sake, or for the sake of consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Such being the result of the test as to constitutional guaranties, what have the <rs>Border States</rs> to fall back upon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Nothing but voting power, in which, also, their position has been greatly weakened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>It <num value="15">fifteen</num> States could not protect themselves thus, can <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> do so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>This safeguard, already inadequate, has been greatly reduced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Their relations, at all events, are <hi rend="italics">new.</hi> The alternative is left them --which new position shall we accept?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Let the comparison be drawn between the <name>Constitutions</name>, the institutions, and the people, between which, the choice lies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The Northern construction of the old Constitution has prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>It has prevailed over judicial decision &mdash; over protest &mdash; over our ballots &mdash; over everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Your view, and that of the <rs type="place">Courts</rs>, has been defeated; their's sustained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>The Constitution of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, on the other hand, is the embodiment of the policy of the <rs>South</rs> from the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>It is all that we claimed the old Constitution to be, with the addition of provisions we did not insist upon under the old Government; because, although to our interest to make them, we felt bound by our bargain not to insist on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Disembarrassed by <hi rend="italics">their</hi> breach of the bonds, we present now a new Constitution, specially adapted to our own necessities and our best development.--So much for our relative Constitutions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/> To compare our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Our institutions and yours are the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Between yours and those of the <rs>North</rs> exists (in opinion at least, and that opinion potent in legislative power,) an irrepressible conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Our policy and yours harmonize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Their policy and yours conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>They have always conflicted in other respects, as well as upon the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Are we not large enough and strong enough for self-protection &mdash; so that no external motive requires union with the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Internal policy can be but promoted by separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>True, we should not have separated, had the bargain been unbroken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>But now the question comes in another form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/> Our relations, and their relations to you as peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>How do they stand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>We have ever been friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>We have fought shoulder to shoulder for the same great principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Common institutions, common interests, a common culture, have made us friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Diverse institutions, diverse interests, a diverse culture, have made them, for the most part, aliens in feeling &mdash; many of them bitterly hostile &mdash; to you and to us. Together our representatives in the national halls have debated points of strife against theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Together we have heard ourselves and our institutions reviled by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>If friendship, association, mutual good feeling, the remembrances of &#x0022;Auld Lang Syne,&#x0022; common hopes for the future, are to decide the question, in whose favor must it be decided?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Such are the results of a comparison of Constitutions, policies and peoples. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/> Both sides now want you. But why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>The motives of which side present the best appeal to your patriotism, your pride, your interests, your safety? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/> What is the future before you with the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>No furture &mdash; literally no future &mdash; unless you are content to become Northern men; unless your nation is to be changed &mdash; your feelings &mdash; your institutions &mdash; your habits &mdash; your ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Are you willing to accept the terms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>But <hi rend="italics">can</hi> you accept them, if you will?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Can you effect these changes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>What will become of the <rs n="Ethiopian" type="ethnic">Ethiopian</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Can he change his skin?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>Is he to be free?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>Is he to stay or go?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>And where to go?--and on what terms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>How will you settle the question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>It must be settled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/> But there are consequences, it may be said, of dissolution &mdash; consequences on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>We are border States, and the brunt of trouble must fall upon us. True.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>We grant it freely; and so do not wonder at your proceeding with caution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>But you will dare to decide the question, and act as brave men on the decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>You have illustrious examples in your own history of daring &mdash; and successful daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Count the costs both ways.--Will it cost more to vindicate your rights, or to surrender them?--to maintain your institutions, or to abandon them?--to remain Southern men, or to become Northern men?--to take care of slaves, or of free blacks?--To which course does patriotism, honor, consistency, point?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>To which does <hi rend="italics">instinct</hi> guide you?--no bad judge, when the whole case is known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/> In the sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought of the people of the <rs>Border States</rs>, the <rs>North</rs>, little as it may think it, has a more formidable foe to face than in their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>There was an insensitive, natural clinging to that which was old and established &mdash; apprehension of that which was new and untried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/><hi rend="italics">The <name>North</name></hi> made this revolution, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The <rs>North</rs> made it, in spite of you; and the <rs>North</rs> maintains its unjust ground with the tenacity with which it becomes you to maintain the truth and your rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>The sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought &mdash; the friends of Union--who remained its friends after the <rs>Constitution</rs> was gone &mdash; partly because they did not distinctly recognize the fact that we were in revolution any how, and the <rs>Constitution</rs> or the <rs>Union</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> or the other, had to go. The Union men laid great stress on the sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>They were greatly deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Those who have real grievances unredressed &mdash; unrepeated by the aggressor-- instead of cooling off, wax warmer by reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The more they thought of it, the more resolute were they for resistance.--Nay, the <rs>Union</rs> men themselves, upon consideration, joined their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>It has been the history everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The feeling has grown with discussion &mdash; with reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/><q>&#x0022;The cooler and clearer the atmosphere, the more distinctly we see objects,&#x0022;</q> (if there be objects to be seen.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/> And so, brethren of the <rs>Border States</rs>, you must confront some form of revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>Revolution is upon you, where you are, as real, as important, as momentous in its consequences, as if you choose to have a voice in deciding and an arm in attaining your own position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>You are left in a Government which has been already revolutionized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The position of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> was revolutionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>Its triumph overthrew the old Constitution and set up a new <num value="1">one</num>, in fact, if not in form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>With you, we endeavored to avert its overthrow &mdash; with you, to set it up again. --But we failed, and declined to enter under the new Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Too important were the interests at stake to be imperilled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The ultimatum is before you &mdash; to accept association upon new and humiliating terms with your anti-slavery confederates, or to unite with your natural allies in the maintenance of common principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>We cannot doubt your ultimate decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Your position was more embarrassing than ours, and many of our people were uneasy at the venture; but common action has in great measure harmonized conflict of sentiment here, and will do so with you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> A glorious future a waits us &mdash; so we believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>We have a magnificent National domain, and all the natural resources a kind <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> could bestow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>It was not our wish to separate from the <rs>North</rs>; but the separation forced upon us is not now unwelcome. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/> Let us have our destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>With the <rs>North</rs> you will be without influence &mdash; merely tolerated --in a government opposed to your policy and institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>You will have no future-- no history &mdash; no associations you can take pleasure in. In a word, your <hi rend="italics">influence</hi> (insignificant at that) <hi rend="italics">will be in our government,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">your interest in another government.</hi> You will have little part or lot in the matter until you cease to be what you are, and become assimilated to the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/> As you now stand, <persName><foreName>Ichabod</foreName></persName> is written upon you forever; &#x0022;the glory has departed;&#x0022; the <persName n="Presidents,IsChild,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00522" reg="mostcommon:Presidents,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsChild">mother of</roleName> <surname>Presidents</surname></persName> will have fallen into insignificance, condemned to a mere negative existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The land of <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00523" reg="mostcommon:Clay,nomatch:0"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> and <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00524" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> will be trodden under foot of the abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>The bones of Old Hickory, shamelessly <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> invoked as they have been of late to counsel submission so wrong, must almost have risen from the grave to avenge the insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>The voice of old <placeName key="tgn,7014021" n="1.000 1" reg="mecklenburg, north carolina, united states">Mecklenburg</placeName> is already heard for the right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/> But a reconstruction is called for. That were a greater miracle than the actual resurrection of the bones of old Hickory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>For the latter event there is almost cause enough.--No.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The crystal has been broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>A new life has been begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>We have felt the stirrings of this life; and to return to the body of death is as distasteful to our thoughts as it would have been to your <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>your <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>(whom shall I name?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>for the name of your patriots is legion,) to return to the embrace of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>The divorce has been for infidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>We crave no re-union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The corruption went to the core. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>The election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00525" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, we are told, was according to the forms of law. It is precisely for this reason that we have resisted to disruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The disease has reached the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>The orderly action of its vital organs turned out for us as a result the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00526" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>We accepted the indication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>It was too late longer to indulge hope. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/> Are not these positions corrects?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Have not the points been rightly stated? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/> Did you not make such points upon your confederates?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>Have you carried them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Were you long in making them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>or will they be long in abandoning them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Upon what ground will you base your surrender?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The unimportance of the points involved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>Want of sincerity in your demands?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Want of justice in making them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Want of spirit to maintain them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>None of these can be the answer.-- What, then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Speak &mdash; to yourselves; speak, and consider the impartial future your auditor --she will find an answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>From the sons of your sires she expects no uncertain sound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>The <rs>North</rs> has said to us, our systems cannot stand together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>We reply, then they must stand <hi rend="italics">apart</hi>--an unexpected conclusion, perhaps!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>They say, <num value="1">one</num> or the other must fall, as they cannot co-exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Not so, say we; they must separate &mdash; that is all. Pursue your policy &mdash; your system of civilization; you are men of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>We, of the <rs>South</rs>, will pursue, likewise, our system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>We can live apart more harmoniously, perhaps, than we have lived together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The <rs>North</rs> seems inclined to influence your choice &mdash; especially that of the Old Dominion and the <rs>Atlantic States</rs>--by military show.--We do not regret this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>There is too much pride in these noble Commonwealths for such exhibition to be otherwise than injurious to those who make it. Old <persName n="Winkle,,Rip,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00527" reg="expanded:Winkle,Rip,,,"><foreName>Rip</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Winkle</surname></persName> is slow, it is true, but he has a good substratum when it is reached. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>The old Ship of State has been broken in twain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>As to <num value="1">one</num> of her parts, we like not her helmsman; we like not, for the most part, her crew; we like not her destination.--We invite you into a new ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Its timbers are sound &mdash; its crew harmonious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>We are seeking the same port. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/> A new and grand development awaits us &mdash; with new energy, diffused into every department of life, action and thought; vast resources, physical, intellectual, moral, we have ingloriously left unprofitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>We have been fond of our ease &mdash; content with foreign supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>A separate existence will stimulate our whole energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Come with us, and let us share our destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Above all, we cannot spare the <persName n="Washington,IsChild,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00528" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsChild">mother of</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, nor the <rs>State</rs> which sent the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> declaration of freedom to the world from the old hills of </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/> It has been remarked that nations are like the century plant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>As this plant blooms but once in every <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, putting forth each time a flower of surpassing magnificence and beauty &mdash; so do nations, but once in their whole history, or oftener in revolving cycles, give birth to some great man, pre-eminent by his genius, and towering in intellect far above his fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>Not only does this hold good, but it may also be affirmed that every nation sooner or later rises to a position higher than it will ever again attain among the sovereignties of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Nations have their.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>day, their hour of influence and glory, in which their greatness is felt and acknowledged, and then they either settle down to their former level, or fall below it, or, losing their very name as well as their prestige, pass away, and have a place only in the records of a former age. The past, the present, and the seemingly inevitable future of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, have suggested these thoughts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/> In the past, it was the proud boast of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, that she was a leader among <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">confederate States</placeName>, and the noble <persName n="Presidents,IsChild,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00741" reg="mostcommon:Presidents,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsChild">mother of</roleName> <surname>Presidents</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Nor was this an empty, unmeaning boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>The claim was universally admitted; <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s supremacy was not debated; the <rs>Presidents</rs> she gave to the nation shaped and controlled its policy, and her great statesmen held undisputed sway over the empire of mind in the politics of this western world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/> Indeed, what reader of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> history is not familiar with the noble part which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> bore in Colonial and revolutionary times?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>No sooner had the encroachments of the crown on Colonial rights begun, than <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> raised her eloquent voice in opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>As early as <dateStruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></dateStruct>, the committee of her Burgesses did not fear <q>&#x0022;to speak irreverently of the <rs>King</rs>'s Government;&#x0022;</q> nor did her bold and independent yeomanry fear to assert that <q>&#x0022;a friendship for the <rs>Governor</rs> was incompatible with the interests of the <name>Colony</name>.&#x0022;</q> --Again, in <dateStruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></dateStruct>, when the news of the passage of the <name n="Stamp Act" type="legislation">Stamp Act</name> reached <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, resolutions strongly condemnatory of that measure were immediately passed by the <rs type="place">Virginia House</rs> of Burgesses, which chanced then to be in session. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/> Now, as it may be profitable to remind the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> of the present day of the great deeds of their fathers; as it may be well for them always to call to mind the rock out of which they were hewn, and the pit out of which they were dug, we ask them to linger with us around the <rs type="place">House of Burgesses</rs>, as it was assembled together in <date value="1765-05">May, 1765</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>To aid us in our task, we invoke the presence of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s historic <persName n="Muse,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00742" reg="mostcommon:Muse,nomatch:0"><surname>Muse</surname></persName>, and we lay under tribute the genius of the biographer of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s greatest orator. </p>
