<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> In the text itself there are doubtless many suggestions of value to the military man, especially upon the subject of artillery, which was <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName>'s speciality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But its character is rendered suspicious by a prevailing and pervading taint &mdash; the desire to underrate and detract from the talents and time of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, his benefactor, whom he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> betrayed and afterwards vilified, and by whom he was denounced as a traitor in a proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He could hardly write a book upon the subject of war without bringing in the name of the greatest of all warriors; yet we are told that it was a defect in his military training, that he had not been a colonel in actual command of a <hi rend="italics">regiment,</hi> which advantage, it seems, he himself had enjoyed, and the enjoyment of which he would no doubt have us to infer had made him no superior to his master that after <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct> he was not the same that he had been, that his military skill had deteriorated that he no longer thought of obtaining victory by any other means than by brave force, that <persName n="Segur,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Segur,nomatch:0"><surname>Segur</surname></persName>, the renegade, gave the best account of the battle of <placeName reg="Borodino, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,2068136">Borodino</placeName> in a book evidently written to curry favor with the <name>Russians</name>, &#x0026;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Another objection, that he did not the day before the battle send a heavy force around <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Russian</rs> wings, was also answered by him on the field, when <persName n="Davoust,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Davoust,nomatch:0"><surname>Davoust</surname></persName> offered to conduct it with his corps of <num value="40000">40,000</num> men. His objection was that <persName n="Davoust,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Davoust,nomatch:0"><surname>Davoust</surname></persName> would necessarily pose communication with the main body, and thus expose himself to destruction.--This was consistent with all his practice.--In order to <hi rend="italics">units</hi> all his forces in <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct> before attacking the enemy in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,7013496" n="1.000 10" reg="Regensburg,Oberpfalz,Bayern,Deutschland,Europe">Ratisbon</placeName>, he made this same Davonat evacuate that city, and bring his force to his on the flank of the <rs>Archduke</rs>'s march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He accomplished it with great difficulty, and the whole force was united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Now, it seems, when the whole army was already united, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was to send off <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of it, and thus expose himself to attack in detail.--Such, at least, was the opinion of <persName n="Segur,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Segur,nomatch:0"><surname>Segur</surname></persName>, and of Marment, too.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>There are, it is true, slight shades of difference, in the relative condition of the <num value="2">two</num> places, and of the armies entrusted with their defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/><placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is a little town of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000">six thousand</num> inhabitants, surrounded by a very strong country, with a river <measure n="800feet" type="distance">eight hundred feet</measure> deep, and <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile wide flowing in front of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, on the contrary, is a city of <num value="30000">30,000</num> inhabitants, is surrounded by works reaching out so far that it would take half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men to lay it under siege, will always be open through <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of its circumference, is unapproachable by a naval force, and has an army now nearly equal in strength to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s, which moreover it has beaten until it has become an object of sheer compassion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>We venture to suggest to the astute tactician of the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> that it is impudence to talk of besieging a city thus situated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>An army must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> beat another army in the field before it can besiege it; but the strategist of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> would have the beaten army improve its position by besieging the victorious army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>A notable device, truly; almost as wise in the conception as that recorded of <persName n="Antoinette,,Marie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="default:Antoinette,Marie,,,"><foreName>Marie</foreName> <surname>Antoinette</surname></persName>, who, when told that her people lacked bread, recommended <rs type="role2">Queen</rs> cake as a substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Nevertheless, the surrender was owing to treachery on the part of <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName>, who had never forgiven <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> for depriving him of the command of the army of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, after he had been disastrously defeated in the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7008561" n="1.000 1" reg="salamanca,salamanca,castilla-leon,espana,europe">Salamanca</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Here, again, we venture to suggest, is some difference, though too slight, possibly, to derange the theories of a paper strategist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>There are no traitors in command here, nor are there likely to be any.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> All this braggadocio is but whistling to keep up the spirits on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Their dependence now is upon destroying the railroads on the <rs>Southside</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>That failing, their whole scheme fails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>That succeeding, they succeed in putting our soldiers on short rations, probably for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, until the damage can be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>If they fight, we shall beat them; if they sit still, the lever will do our work for us. Either way their job is a desperate <num value="1">one</num>.
