<head>The Monitor and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> If the foreign public and their Governments permit themselves to be led astray by the <rs>Northern</rs> accounts of the relative merits of these <num value="2">two</num> vessels, they will have only their own credulity to blame for the expensive and disastrous blunders they are likely to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They have had warnings enough before this that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are incapable of rolling the truth to save them from being gulled by the monstrous fable that the <rs>Monitor</rs> drove off the <rs>Virginia</rs>, and is a superior vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The facts are directly the reverse; but without a moments hesitation, they swallow the fable, and their journals recommend the construction of vessels of a like character without seeming to suspect that the data upon which they are building may be purely imaginary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Now, the truth is, not only that the <rs>Monitor</rs> was chased away from the field by the <rs>Virginia</rs>, and not only has she never dared to accept <num value="1">one</num> of the defiant challenges which the <rs>Virginia</rs> has repeatedly given her to renew the combat, but she could not if she would, without losing every man on beard of her, even if she herself were not sunk, as she inevitably would be, in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> engagement, at once to the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We are credibly informed that only <num value="1">one</num> man who was on board of her at the time of the fight with the <rs>Virginia</rs> has survived the effects of the concussion in that engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The Virginia, with her spacious dimensions and admirable construction, bore the concussion of her own guns without difficulty, whilst the balls from her enemy rattled off from her iron sheeting like hall from a roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But it was a different thing with the <name>Bricason</name>, as the result has proven although the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, with their usual ingenuity, have contrived not only to cover up their losses, but make the world believe that their vessel was invincible and invulnerable, and in every respect a triumphed success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Since the battle, that wonderful <term type="ship">ship</term>, the <rs type="ship">Virginia</rs>, which, like everything really meritorious in this world, is unappreciated even by his friends, and eclipsed by every noisy humbug, has been greatly strengthened and rendered the most powerful and formidable craft that ever floated on the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>We do not believe that at this rate the whole navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would be a match for her There are not a dozen of the best ships of the line of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, that the could not send to the bottom just as easily as she did the <rs>Cumberland</rs> and Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We are not satisfied that the could not enter <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, for if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invaders' ships can batter down forts in Southern lands, we don't see why the <rs>Virginia</rs> should not be able to damage <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We hops before she has finished her career, she will have the honor of inflicting some vengeance upon that spot which from the beginning has inflicted such mischief upon our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>But we trust that it will be a long time before her glorious career is ended, She is capable of far greater things than she has yet accomplished.
