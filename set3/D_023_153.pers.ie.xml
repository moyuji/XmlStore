<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I can furnish the committee a copy of the plan if they desire it. I do not have it here now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Question.--State the substance of it, if you please? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Answer &mdash; I state in substance, that </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> I thought it advisable to concentrate the army in the neighborhood of Wassenton to make a small government across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> as a feint, which a view to divert the attention of the enemy, and lead them to believe we were going to move in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, and then to make a rapid movement of the whole army to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> on this side of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>As my reasons for that, I stated that the further we got into the interior of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the longer would be our line of communication, and the greater would be the difficulty we would have in keeping them open, as the enemy had upon our right flank a corps that at almost any time could, by a rapid movement, seriously embarrass us. If we were caught by the elements so far from our bass of supplies, and at the same time in the enemy's country, where they had means of getting information that we had not, it might, I thought, prove <unclear></unclear> to the army, as we had but <num value="1">one</num> line of railway by which to supply it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> In moving upon <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> we would all the time be as near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as would the enemy, and after arriving at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> we would be at a point nearer to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> than we would be even if we should take <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>On the <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> line the enemy, in my opinion, would not give us a decisive battle at any place this side of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They would defend <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> until such time as they had felt they had given us a check, and then, with so many lines of railroad open to them, they would move upon <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> or upon <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, and in either case the difficulty of following them would be very great. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> In connection with this movement I requested that barges, filled with provisions and forage, should be floated to Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, where they could vastly be landed, materials be collected for the reconstruction of the wharves there, and that all the wagons in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> that could possibly be spared be filled with hard bread and small commissary stores, and, with a large number of beef cattle, be started down to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> on the road by way of <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, and that this wagon train and hard of cattle should be preceded by a pontoon train large enough to span the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> twice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> I stated that this wagon train could move in perfect safety, because it would be all the time between our army and the <rs>Potomac</rs> or in other words our army and the <rs>Potomac</rs>; or in other words our army would be all the time between the enemy and that train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But, at the same time, I said that if a cavalry escort could not be furnished from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, I would send some of my cavalry to guard the train. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> On the morning of the <date value="11-14">14th of November,</date> feeling uneasy in reference to the pontoons, as I had not heard of their starting, I directed my <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Engineer">Chief Engineer</rs> to telegraph again with reference to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> Question &mdash; To whom did he telegraph! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Answer.--He telegraphed to <persName n="Woodbury,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Woodbury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Woodbury</surname></persName> or to <persName n="Spanding,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Spanding,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Spanding</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It subsequently appeared that <sic>that</sic> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they ever had heard of my wish to have the pontoon train started down for <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, although the authorities in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> bad had my pian sent to them on the <date value="11-09">9th of November,</date> and it had also been discovered by <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> and <persName n="Melgs,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Melgs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Melgs</surname></persName> at my headquarters on the night of the <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> and <date value="11-12">12th of November,</date> and after discussing it fully there, they sat down and sent telegrams to <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, which, as I supposed, covered fully the case, and would secure the starting of the pontoon trains at once. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> I supposed, of course, that those portions of the plan which required to be attended to in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> would be carried out there at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I could have sent my own officers there to attend to those matters, and perhaps I made a mistake in not doing so, as <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> afterwards told me that I ought not to have trusted to them in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for the details. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> In reply to the telegram I had ordered to be sent, <persName n="Woodbury,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Woodbury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Woodbury</surname></persName> telegraphed back that the pontoons would start on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, probably, and certainly on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, which would have been on the <dateStruct value="-11-16"><day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="-11-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, and would have been in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They did not, however, start until the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num>, and on that day it commenced raining, which delayed them so much, and the roads became so bad, that when the train got to <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> they floated the pontoons off the wagons; sent to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for a steamer, and carried them down to Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> by water, sending the wagons around by land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The pontoon did not get here until the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num> or <date value="11-23">23d of November.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> On the <date value="11-15">15th of November</date> I started the column down the road to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, not knowing anything about the delay in the starting of the pontoons, because the telegram announcing the delay did not reach <placeName reg="Warrenton Junction">Warrenton Junction</placeName> until I had left to come down here with the troops, and the telegram did not reach me until I arrived here on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th</day></dateStruct>, when it was handed to me by an orderly who had brought it down to <placeName reg="Warrenton Junction">Warrenton Junction</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> After reaching here, I saw at once that there was no chance for crossing the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> with the army at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It commenced raining, and the river began to rise, not to any great extent, but I did not know now much it might rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>There was no means of crossing, except by going up to the fords, and it would be impossible to do that because of the inability to supply the troops after they should cross. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, with his command, arrived here in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>He sent to me, asking if he should cross the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He was very much tempted to take his own corps across to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> by a ford near <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName>, as there was no enemy there except a very small force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> I did not think it advisable that he should cross at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The plan I had in contemplation was, if the stores and those bridges had come here, as I expected, to throw <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s whole corps across the <rs>Rappahannock Fill</rs> the wagons with as many small stores as we could, and having beef cattle along for meat, then to make a rapid movement down in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and try to meet the enemy and fight a battle before <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> could make a junction there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He Knew that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, and felt that there was force <unclear></unclear> on the <rs>Upper Rappahannock</rs> to take care of him. He felt certain that as soon as the enemy knew of our crossing down here, the forces under <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,W.,Edward,,:1"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> would be recalled, and he wanted to meet this force and beat it before <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> could make a Junction with them, or before <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> could come down on our flank and perhaps cripple us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> I had recommended that some supplies should be rent to the month of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, with a view of establishing a depot at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName> after we had advanced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> Stores have been always in as great abundance as we could have expected, for, after the <date value="11-19">19th of November,</date> the weather and the roads were particularly bad. Horses and mules were sent down to us, so that our cavalry and teams were in very good condition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> After it was ascertained that there must be a delay, and that the enemy had concentrated in such force as to make it very difficult to cross except by a number of bridges, we commenced bringing up from Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> all the pontoons we could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>After enough of them had been brought up to build the brings, I called several councils of War, to decide about crossing the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> decided to cross down at Snicker's Neck, about <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> below here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>But our demonstration was simply for the purpose of drawing down there as large a force of the enemy as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I then decided to cross here, because, in the first place, I felt satisfied that they did not expect us to cross here, but down below, In the next place, I left satisfied that this was the place to fight the most decisive battle, because, if we could divide their forces by pressing their lines at <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> points, separating their left from their right, then a vigorous attach with the whole army would succeed in breaking their army in pieces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> The enemy had cut a road along the rear of the line of heights, where we made our attack, by means of which they connected the <num value="2">two</num> wings of their army, and avoided a long detour round through a bad country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> I obtained, from a colored man from the other side of the town, information in regard to this new road which proved to be correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I wanted to obtain possession of that new road, and that was my reason for making an attack on the extreme left.--I did not intend to make the attack on the right until that position had been taken, which I supposed would stagger the enemy by cutting their line in <num value="2">two</num>, and then I proposed to make a direct attack on their front and drive them out of the works. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> I succeeded in building <num value="6">six</num> bridges, and in taking the whole army across.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The <num value="2">two</num> attacks were made, and we were repulsed &mdash; still holding a portion of the ground we had fought upon, but not our extreme advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>That night I went all over the field on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>In fact, I was with the officers and men until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I found the feeling to be father against an attack the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>In fact it was decidedly against it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> I returned to my headquarters, and after conversation with <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, told him that I wanted him to order the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 9">9th army corps</orgName>, which was the corps I originally commanded, to form the next morning a column of attack by regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It consisted of some <num value="18">eighteen</num> old regiments and some new ones, and desired the column to make a direct at tack upon the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I thought that these regiments, by driving quickly up after each other, would be able to carry the stone wall and the batteries in front, forcing the enemy into their next line, and by joining in with them they would not be able to fire upon us to any great extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I left <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> with that understanding, and directed him to give the order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> The order was given, and the order of attack was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>On the next morning, just before the column was to have started <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> came up to me and said, <q>&#x0022;General, I hope you will desist from this attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>I do not know of any general officer who approves of it, and I think it will prove disastrous to the army.&#x0022;</q> Advice of that kind from <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, who has always been in favor of our advance whenever it is possible, caused me to hesitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I kept the column of attack formed, <unclear></unclear> sent over for the division and corps command <unclear></unclear> consulted with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>They unanimously voted against the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>I then went over to see the officers of the command on the other side, and <unclear></unclear> that the same opinion prevailed among them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> I then sent for <persName n="Franklin,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, who was on the left, and he was of exactly the same opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>This caused me to decide that I ought not to make the attack I had contemplated, and, besides, inasmuch as the <rs>President</rs>, of the <rs>U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I felt that I could not take the responsibility of ordering the attack, notwithstanding my own belief at the time that the works of the enemy could be carried. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> In the afternoon of that day I again saw the officers, and told them that I had decided to withdraw to this side of the river all our forces except enough to hold the town and the bridge heads, but should keep the bridges there for future operations in case we wanted to cross again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> I accordingly ordered the withdrawal, leaving <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> to conduct the withdrawal of our forces from the town, and <persName n="Franklin,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName> to conduct it on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>During that evening I received a note from <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, and about <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> at night <persName n="Butterfield,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Butterfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Butterfield</surname></persName> came over with a message from <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, stating that he (<persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>) felt it his duty to represent to me the condition in which I was leaving the town and the troops in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>I then partially decided to withdraw the whole command, which was a still more perilous operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>It commenced raining, which to some extent was assistance to us, but a very bad thing in the moving of troops.
