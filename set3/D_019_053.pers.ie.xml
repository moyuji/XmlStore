<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He did not propose to enter upon a full discussion of the great questions before the <rs>Convention</rs>, but to notice briefly some of the arguments tied in favor of secession by gentlemen upon this floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He alluded to the influences that had been brought to bear upon the body, and claimed the privilege of expressing his mind fully and freely, independent of influences here or elsewhere.--Free speech was the right of a free people.--Ancient and modern history furnished abundant examples that where free speech was dialed the voice of liberty was drowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He then went on to examine some of the great evils brought to the notice of the <rs>Convention</rs> by some of the gentlemen on the other side.--He acknowledged these evils and repudiated them but he was here not to break up the <rs>Union</rs>, but to demand a redress of those grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>There was no instance in which the general Government had been derelict in the discharge of its duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The remedy proposed by others was secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If it be true, as many able men here think, and as many able judges decided, that there was no constitutional right of secession, the remedy can have no weight with a constitution-loving people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>If <num value="100">100</num>% proper construction of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> justifies secession, we have never had a Union at all; and if the position could be maintained, he was willing that the principle of law should be brought to bear upon such an illicit intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He would admit at such right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> He alluded to the purchase of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He could never believe that the <rs>Government</rs> would have expended such a vast amount for that purpose, if they were to be allowed to walk off with the spoils at their own pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>If the doctrine were true, in my hour of trial, a State may go out of the <rs>Union</rs>, leave those with whom she had been allied and join the enemy, or go out at her convenience, and leave the debt incurred by war for the other States to pay. The right of State to secede was spurned from the <name>Con</name><unclear></unclear> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, which met to ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He denied that a construction, Serving the right, could be properly given to be resolutions of <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">99</year></dateStruct>, and read from <unclear></unclear> writings to sustain the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The Best Coalition of secession appeared in the <orgName n="Hartford Convention" type="convention">Hartford Convention</orgName>, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>; <unclear></unclear>in the latter case, the iron logic of <rs type="role">Gen.</rs><unclear></unclear> and the verdict of the great <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, put a seal upon it, and it did not appear again until very recently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>In regard to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, he said she had been dragged out in opposition to the popular voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He then read from a speech of <persName n="Cobb,,Howell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="default:Cobb,Howell,,,"><foreName>Howell</foreName> <surname>Cobb</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, delivered some years ago, embodying is argument against the constitutional right of secession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The evils of the day, as announced here, were next commented on. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, the acrimony with which Southern institutions had been pursued by Northern men. He conceived that an act of secession would, instead of <unclear>si</unclear>, agitate the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>, the efforts Northern abolitionists to entice our slaves <unclear></unclear> abscond, the <rs>Personal Liberty</rs> bills, and the obstructions to the execution of the <rs>Future Slave Law</rs>. He asked gentlemen how secession would remedy these evils?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>In such an event, the inducements to fly across the <unclear></unclear> will be increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>There will be none of the power of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to recover them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He denounced the <rs>Personal Liberty</rs> law as an insult to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and to the whole <rs>North</rs>, but they had never been enforced, or interposed any obstruction to the recovery of fugitive slaves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>--the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> threatens to exclude the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> &mdash; to destroy the equality of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>This he would ever oppose, but would not resort to secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He would never submit to inequality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>(Some person in the lobby gave a slight hiss, which <persName n="Willey,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Willey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Willey</surname></persName> sarcastically rebuked.) Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>he contended, would never secure our equal rights in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Turning our backs upon the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and giving them up, was the most inefficient remedy that the mind of man could conceive of. It was also contended that the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> had got control of the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; that the rights of the <rs>South</rs> were insecure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He deplored the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, or any other sectional <rs type="role2">President</rs>; but he should oppose him with the weapons of reason, and when they failed it was time enough to resort to the <hi rend="italics">ultima ratio.</hi> Again, it was said that <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> we were in a minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our &#x0022;Southern sisters,&#x0022; as they were called, were responsible for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They had left us in this minority, in defiance of our remonstrances, and left us to be trodden under the heel of Black Republicanism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> It was alleged by the gentleman from <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName> that the honor of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> required that she should secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He believed her honor required that she should contend for her rights, and not yield an inch to her enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It had also been said that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would use the patronage of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to corrupt <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>This was an argument that he would not dare to use before his people, and would only say in reply that if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was of such easy virtue as to be corrupted by a little Federal pap, her honor was not worth preserving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The speaker adverted briefly to the <rs>John Brown</rs> raid, in regard to which the dignity of the <rs>State</rs> had been vindicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>If the <rs>State</rs> seceded, her border would be constantly exposed to such raids. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> In reply to the position of the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2510683;tgn,7012288" n="0.165 000000.3301	placename;tgn,2510683;middlesex village, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0120	placename;tgn,7012288;middlesex,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe" reg="middlesex village, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;middlesex,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe">Middlesex</placeName>, who had read from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>'s <persName n="Address,,Farewell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="default:Address,Farewell,,,"><foreName>Farewell</foreName> <surname>Address</surname></persName> to show that the experiment of Government had failed, he alluded to the vastness of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> empire, and thought if we were true to ourselves we were but on the threshold of our greatness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> He then proceeded to allude to the evils to result from secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The country would not only be divided into a Northern and a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, but in course of time it would be divided into petty Confederacies, and then would come constant warfare, of which we have an example in the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Another result would be the commencement of the abolition of slavery, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and ultimately in the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This was the idea of <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, <persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,nomatch:0"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName> and <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>.--They wanted to draw a belt of fire around us. Whether it be right or wrong, the moral sentiment of the world was against slavery, and the force of all would be exerted against it.--Entangling foreign alliances would be another evil result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>If the <rs>Union</rs> is dissolved, too, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> could conquer the <rs>South</rs>, and she had no means of preventing it. He said it was a very easy thing to pull down this Government, but very difficult to build it up again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>As to the question where shall <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> go, he said he would go nowhere, but stay where we are, and plant the <rs>State</rs> firmly upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The perils of the new Government at the <rs>South</rs> were alluded to. The provisional Constitution had no force derived from the people; but they were going to work to make a permanent Government, from which we might expect little less than a military despotism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> Secession implies the necessity of putting this State upon a war footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Though we might go out peaceably, it would not be <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> before we should be involved in all the horrors of civil war. The Western and North-western counties would have <measure n="450miles" type="distance">450 miles</measure> of hostile border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>They are cut off from the balance of the <rs>State</rs> by an almost impassable barrier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Should they be left in such a condition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The Legislature had inaugurated a measure to appropriate <num value="1000000">one million</num> of dollars for the defence of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>In his opinion, it would require <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> to put the <rs>Northwest</rs> in a proper state of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The State debt and largely increased taxation were next briefly considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>It would amount to a burden that the people would not endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The great resources of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>-- her commercial advantages &mdash; her mineral treasures &mdash; her geographical position &mdash; promised future greatness and grandeur to the old Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He could not conceive that she would forfeit all these considerations for the sake of becoming the appendage of some &#x0022;miserable <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.&#x0022; Secession destroys our nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The flag which has waved in triumph and protected our commerce all over the world, would no longer be as a shield to our people wherever they might be. He knew the <rs>Southern States</rs> had gone, but if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> stands fast, the wanderers may be eventually brought back, and the <rs>Union</rs> restored. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> have played their deep, temporizing game with profound address and subtlety; but there is no longer any need of concealment, and the veil drops from the false prophet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The <rs>Demon</rs> of Coercion stands unmasked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The sword is drawn and the scabbard thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>If the <num value="15">fifteen</num> Slave States had gone out in a body, this would have never been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>But, as it is, the <rs>Border States</rs> lie almost at the mercy of an invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Their forts are filled with Federal troops, whilst they have not raised a finger for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>No doubt <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, in a month, will be powerfully reinforced, and ere long <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> may be engaged in a life and death struggle for independence, honor, and for all that makes existence worth having. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/> We have no intention of arguing the points raised by his Sable <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> upon the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>That is a subject upon which there is the most radical disagreement between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, a disagreement which he proposes to reconcile by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>This pregnant paragraph is all that concerns us: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/></hi> Doing this I deem to be only a <hi rend="italics">simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it</hi> so far as practicable, unless my rightful master, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>shall withhold the requisite means, or, in some authoritative manner, direct the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>I trust that will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the <rs>Union</rs> that it will continually defend and maintain itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the <rs>National</rs> authority.

Even this movement which would once have been effectual, may now be too late to avert the catastrophe, but it will at all events mitigate its force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>It will increase the difficulties of the ferocious enterprise which these enemies of humanity propose; it is the only alternative, except the most abject humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Henceforth, we venture to predict, there will be no difference of opinion in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> as to the course of duty, of interest and of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>We have often protested against the application of the term Submissionists to any party in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.--We accord to those who have counselled delay and negotiation the same sincerity of motive which we claim for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>We believe that all parties are imbued with a common love of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and that the <name>Legislature</name> expressed the will of the whole State when it declared, by a unanimous voice, that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would resist coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>We believe that declaration will be sustained by the unanimous voice of the <rs>Virginia</rs> people; that henceforth the hatchet of internal discord will be buried, and that, shoulder to shoulder, and heart to heart, we shall stand in a solid phalanx in defence of the independence of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> sovereignty, and the sanctity of the <rs>Southern</rs> soil. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/> Several resolutions on the <rs>National</rs> difficulties were offered yesterday, and referred to the <rs>Committee</rs> on Federal Relations.

<head>Correction of an Error.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> We yesterday made a mistake over which, we suppose, all the school boys of the town have been chuckling, if they have time, in these bustling days, to think of anything so common place as their school books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>We called M&#x0152;ris, <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7000856" n="1.000 10" reg="Meroe,An-Nil,Ash-Shamaliyah,As-Sudan,Africa">Meroe</placeName>,</hi> substituting the great city for the great lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>We certainly knew better, yet we made the mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>We are not sorry for it, however, since it furnishes us with another occasion to show, not only that there is, literally, nothing new under the sun, but that the ancients did some things on a scale and in a style which the moderns cannot hope to rival. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> <placeName reg="Lake City, Columbia, Florida" key="tgn,2020038">Lake</placeName> M&#x0152;ris was said by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00286" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName></hi> to have been <num value="3600">3,600</num> stadia in circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Now, as a stadium was <num value="202">202</num> of our yards, this would give a circumference of <measure n="414miles" type="distance">414 miles</measure>. The diameter, then, was about <measure n="138miles" type="distance">138 miles</measure>, and the area equal, we should think, to the whole country bounded by a line running from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> line, the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, a line from <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> to the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> line, and the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> line as far down as the point of intersection with the line from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>In other words, an extent of country equal to the whole south side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, was covered by the waters of this lake, which, the same authority tells us, were about <num value="200">two hundred</num> cubits deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The bed of the lake, he farther says was excavated by human hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>As a proof of the fact, he states that there were, in his day, <num value="2">two</num> pyramids in it, the half of each of which was above the water and the other half below it. He says it was constructed by a king called <hi rend="smallcaps">M&#x0152;ris,</hi> to regulate the depth of the water upon the country exposed to the inundations of the <rs>Nile</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>If everything he says about it be true, it was the most stupendous work ever devised and executed by human forethought and energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The Pyramids sink into absolute insignificance beside it. The canal and locks that led to it, from the <rs>Nile</rs>, were on the most stupendous scale. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/> Our reference to the discovery of the site of <placeName reg="Lake City, Columbia, Florida" key="tgn,2020038">Lake</placeName> M&#x0152;ris was founded on our recollection of a lecture delivered by the late <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Gliddon,,George,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00287" reg="default:Gliddon,George,R.,,"><foreName n="George">Geo.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Gliddon</surname></persName>,</hi> in this city, <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> ago. We know scarcely anything of Egyptology, which seems of late years to have assumed the rank of a distinct science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>As well as we can recollect, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G.'s narrative ran nearly as follows: <cit><q rend="inline">Ancient writers had distinctly marked the site of <placeName reg="Lake City, Columbia, Florida" key="tgn,2020038">Lake</placeName> M&#x0152;ris, by placing it <num value="70">seventy</num> or <placeName><distance reg="80miles">eighty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName></placeName>, and stating that it lay between that city and Arsin&#x0152;, now a pile of ruins, going by the name of Medinet of Fajoum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>As this position corresponds with that of the modern <persName><foreName>Birket</foreName></persName>-Caroun, a comparatively insignificant affair, only about <measure n="150miles" type="distance">one hundred and fifty miles</measure> in circumference, travellers concluded that this was the real M&#x0152;ris, and that the father of history had drawn upon his imagination for his facts.--This conclusion they drew while they were standing on the very ground that the <rs type="place">Pharaotic lake</rs> had occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Nor was it wonderful, considering what a vast circumference the old lake occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>If this city had once been the centre of a lake extending <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure> from it in all directions, the boundaries could hardly be found by travelling from spot to spot inside of the circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lepsius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00288" reg="mostcommon:Lepsius,nomatch:0"><surname>Lepsius</surname></persName></hi> had greater faith in the old <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> chronicler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>He had seen his statements so often justified by modern discoveries, that he thought it better to test them than to content himself with giving him the lie.--Making a thorough examination, he discovered the remains of <num value="2">two</num> pyramids answering to the locality of those described by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00289" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName>.</hi> From these he took his departure, judging that they lay at a certain distance from the circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>At the supposed distance he found traces of embankments, &#x0026;c., answering to the circumference in question, and following them, he found that they led him back to the place he started from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Hence, he concluded that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00290" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName></hi> had told the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>This, as nearly as we can recollect, was the substance of that portion of the lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>We are not altogether certain that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lepsius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00291" reg="mostcommon:Lepsius,nomatch:0"><surname>Lepsius</surname></persName></hi> was the explorer in question, but we believe he was. </q><bibl n="Mr. G's"></bibl></cit> </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<div4 type="speech" n="1"> 
<head>Inaugural:</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> <hi rend="italics">Fellow-Citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>:</hi> In compliance with a custom as old as the <rs>Government</rs> itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> to be taken by the <rs>President</rs> before he enters on the duties of his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety nor excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> that by the accession of a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Administration their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>It is found in nearly all the public speeches of him who now addresses you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/> I do but quote from <num value="1">one</num> of these speeches when I declare, &#x0022;that I have no purpose, directly nor indirectly, to interfere with the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the <name>States</name> in which it exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>I do believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.&#x0022;--Those who nominated and elected me, did so with the full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recalled them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>And more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That the maintenance inviolate of the right of the <name>States</name>, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power of which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depends; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the greatest of crimes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/> I now reiterate these sentiments, and in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the <name>States</name>, when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause &mdash; as cheerfully to <num value="1">one</num> section as to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>The clause I now read is as plainly written in the <rs>Constitution</rs> as any other of its provisions: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/> &#x0022;No person held to service or labor in <num value="1">one</num> State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or resolution therein, be declared free from such service or labor, but shall be delivered upon the claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/> It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves, and the intention of the law is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution &mdash; to this provision as much as to any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up, their oaths are imperative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not, with equal unanimity, frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that oath?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>There is some difference of opinion whether this clause shall be enforced by national or by State authority, but surely that difference is not a very material <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to him or to others by which authority it is done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>And should any <num value="1">one</num> in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Again &mdash; In any law on this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>And might it not be well, at the same time, to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the <rs>Constitution</rs> which guarantees that &#x0022;the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens in the several States?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/> I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservation, and with no purpose to construe the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws by any hypothetical rules, and while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be more safe for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/> It is <measure n="72years" type="date">seventy-two years</measure> since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inauguration of a President under our National Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>During that period <num value="15">fifteen</num> different, and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the <rs type="place">Executive branch</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Yet, with all this scope for precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, under great and peculiar difficulties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/> A dissolution of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>I hold that in contemplation of the universal law and of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the <rs>Union</rs> of these States is perpetual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.--It is safe to assert that no government, proper, ever had a provision in its organic laws for its own termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>Continue to execute all of the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the <rs>Union</rs> will endure forever, it being impossible to destroy it, except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Again &mdash; If the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> be not a Government proper, but an association of States in the nature of a contract merely, it is a contract not to be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who have made it.-- <num value="1">One</num> party to a contract may violate it, break it, so to speak, but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/> Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that, in legal contemplation, the <rs>Union</rs> is perpetual, confirmed by the history of the <rs>Union</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The Union is much older than the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>It was formed, in fact, by the <rs>Articles</rs> of Association in <date value="1776.">1776</date> It was nurtured and continued by the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> in <date value="1776.">1776</date> It was further matured, and the faith of all the then <num value="13">thirteen</num> States plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, in <date value="1778,">1778</date> and finally, in <date value="1787,">1787</date> <num value="1">one</num> of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the <rs>Constitution</rs>, was to form a more perfect Union; but if the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs> by <num value="1">one</num>, or by a part only, of the <name>States</name>, be lawfully possible, the <rs>Union</rs> is less perfect than before &mdash; the <rs>Constitution</rs> having lost the vital element of perpetuity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/> It follows, from these views, that no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the <rs>Union</rs>, that passes resolves and ordinances to that effect, which are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or States, against the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/> I therefore consider that in view of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws the <rs>Union</rs> is unbroken, and to the best of my ability <hi rend="italics">I shall take care, as the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the <rs>Union</rs> be faithfully executed in all the <name>States</name>.</hi> Doing this, I deem to be only a <hi rend="italics">simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it,</hi> so far as practicable, unless my rightful master, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people, shall withhold the requisite means, or, in some authoritative manner, direct the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>I trust that this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the <rs>Union</rs> that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the <rs>National</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/><hi rend="italics">The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the <rs>Government</rs>, and to collect the duties on imports:</hi> but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>Where hostility to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in any interior locality, shall be so great and so universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the <rs>Federal</rs> offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> While the strict legal right may exist in the <rs>Government</rs> to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished to all parts of the <rs>Union</rs> as far as possible.--The people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The course here indicated will be followed, unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing, and with the view and the hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/> That there are persons in <num value="1">one</num> section or another who seek to destroy the <rs>Union</rs> at all events, and are glad of any pretext, I will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>To those, however, who really love the <rs>Union</rs>, before entering on so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?--Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portions of the ills you fly from have no real existence?--Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>All profess to be content in the <rs>Union</rs> if all constitutional rights can be maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Is it true, then, that any right plainly written on the <rs>Constitution</rs> has been denied?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>I think not. Happily, the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this thing.--Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs> has ever been denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>If, by the mere force of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>It certainly would if such right were a vital <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>But such is not our case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>All the vital rights of minorities, and of individuals, are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guarantees and prohibitions in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that controversies can never arise concerning them; but organic law can never be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible questions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/> Shall fugitives from justice be surrendered by national or by State authority?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The Constitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The Constitution does not expressly say.--From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.-- If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the <rs>Government</rs> must cease.--There is no other alternative for continuing the <rs>Government</rs> but acquiescence on <num value="1">one</num> side or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>If a minority in such a case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which, in turn, will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such a minority.--For instance, why may not any portion of the new Confederacy, a year or <num value="2">two</num> hence, arbitrarily secede again precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Is there such perfect identity of interests among the <name>States</name> to compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Whoever rejects it, does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>Unanimity is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The will of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible, so that rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism, in some form, is all that is left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/> I do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case on the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases, by all other departments of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>And while it is obviously possible that such decisions may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, it can be better borne than could the evils of a deficient practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>At the same time the candid citizen must confess <hi rend="italics">that if the policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal action, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,</hi> having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.--Nor is there in this view any assault upon the <rs type="place">Court</rs> or the <rs>Judges</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> <num value="1">One</num> section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>This is the only substantial dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>The fugitive slave clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well in forced as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.--The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over it in each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>This I think cannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after a separation of the sections than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in <num value="1">one</num> section, while the fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Physically speaking, we cannot separate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this.--They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Is it possible, then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Suppose you go to war. You cannot fight always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>When, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/> This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise the constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the <rs>National Constitution</rs> amended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>While I make no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself, and I should, under existing circumstances, favor, rather than oppose, a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it.--I will venture to add that to me the <rs>Convention</rs> mode seems preferable, in that its amendments are to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> I understand a proposed amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs> (which amendment, however, I have not seen,) has passed Congress, to the effect that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the <name>States</name>, including that of persons held to service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments, so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> derives all his authority from the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>The people themselves can do this, also, if they choose, but the <rs>Executive</rs>, as such, has nothing to do with it. It is his duty to administer the present Government as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor.--Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Is there any better or equal hope in the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>In our present differences, is either party without faith of being in the right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>If the <rs>Almighty Ruler</rs> of Nations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side, of the <rs>North</rs>, or yours, of the <rs>South</rs>, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>By the form of the <rs>Government</rs> under which we live, this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief, and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little into their own hands at very short intervals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> While the people retain their virtue and vigilance no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the <rs>Government</rs> in the short space of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> My countrymen, <num value="1">one</num> and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>If there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it.--Such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and on the sensitive point the laws of your own framing under it, while the new Administration will have no power, if it would, to change either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this land, are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> Government, while I shall have the most solemn <num value="1">one</num> to preserve, protect, and defend it. I am loath to close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>We are not enemies, but friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>We must not be enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field and patriot's grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone all-over this broad line, will yet swell the chorus of the <rs>Union</rs> when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/> The local troops and the companies of U. S. soldiers formed the <rs>President</rs>'s escort. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/> A large body of Federal forces were kept in reserve in case of an emergency. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/> Several prominent housetops along the route were occupied by detachments of riflemen, and the principal avenues and approaches to the city were guarded by detachments of local military. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> The day was fine, and nothing occurred to mar the harmony of the occasion. </p>
