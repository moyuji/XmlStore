<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> News from the <rs>North</rs> and from the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> world, received in this city within a few days, is of a character very cheering to the prospects of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who daily reads the extracts from Federal newspapers can fall to see that the day of our independence is not far distant, and that, before many months roll away, the dark clouds of war will be lifted from our Southern land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The question now seems to be narrowing down to <num value="1">one</num> of finance alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Victorious on every field, our chivalric volunteers have shown the enemy it is folly to cope with them unless with odds of half a dozen to <num value="1">one</num> in his favor &mdash; and can such an army be maintained against us ! The maxim of war--<q>&#x0022;That nation conquers which has the longest purse&#x0022;</q>--is likely to prove true in the present struggle between a large and formatical Government and the comparatively few but earnest and determined, people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In a battle between soldiers of equal courage and daring, victory goes with the heaviest battalions; but in the general conduct of a war, that nation conquers, <hi rend="italics">ceteris</hi> paribus, which can best afford the enormous outlay and expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A country which derives its revenue, from the products of its, own soil, is always wealthy; while that dependent upon its manufactures, and upon export and import duties, can only derive an income when its commerce and trade with foreign nations is uninterrupted by the vicissitudes of war. No Government can carry on war and pay in specialist vast expenditures, but it must have some basis of credit upon which, to issue its bonds or obligations to pay at some future date., The issuing of bonds, notes, or bills of credit, when based, upon the value of some necessary production of the soil, as in the <rs>South</rs>--upon cotton, rice, sugar, and tobacco &mdash; is a matter of great good both to the <rs>Government</rs> and the people, provided it is not carried too far. The issuing of bonds, as the <rs>Northern Government</rs> has done, based upon probable profits of a future duty upon imports, is a pernicious evil, and will inevitably result in a great financial crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>History has given us some good less bits upon this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> During the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> revolution, when it became necessary, owing to the scarcity of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, to provide some circulating medium for public convenience, continental money was issued to the amount of <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the plan worked admirably, and the colonies derived material advantage from their bills of credit, which soon came into general use. The result was that species was almost entirely driven from circulation; but so long as the people had confidence in the paper issue, it did as well for all domestic purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>So far so good; but when the paper substituted for specie was increased beyond the usual amount of specie in the country it began to depreciate in value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Of course this deprecation in creased with the amount of paper issued, until at last it became so low in public estimation that <num value="100">one hundred</num> paper dollars would hardly buy <num value="1">one</num> of silver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Still this paper currency continued the circulating medium from <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></dateStruct>, and was almost entirely used in domestic trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>When peace was declared the continental paper money fell below nothing, and the <rs>State</rs> found themselves in a prostrate condition that might have been avoided had the paper issue been limited to the actual necessities of the times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> The Federal Government has fallen into precisely the same error, and is pledging its bonds with the utmost prodigality, to carry on a ruinous and vindictive war. Every day records its progress towards the &#x0022;high old panic&#x0022; called for by the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>more than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago, and the people themselves see a financial crisis approaching that will throw the &#x0022;great <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> bubble&#x0022; in the shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The banks refuse to take the <rs>Government</rs> &#x0022;promise to pay&#x0022; as a basis for banking; the bonds are sold in the market at a discount of <num value="0.04">four per cent</num>, capitalists have no confidence in the faith of the <rs>Government</rs>, and are investing their money in gold and foreign exchange preparatory to moving it out of the country; and the people are accusing each other of conspiracy to defeat the financial schemes of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Every possible dollar has been drawn from the banks, and they have lent the <rs>Government</rs> already more than the amount of their capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The weekly bank statement in New York, for the week ending <date value="12-28">December 28,</date> shows the following condition: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The result is the banks are unable to aid the <rs>Government</rs> further, and have already gone to a ruinous extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Last week a Bankers Convention met in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, in which resolutions were passed adverse to the reception of National bonds, and <num value="1">one</num> of the members, <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName>, if I am correctly informed went on to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The excitement in the <rs>North</rs> regarding the <rs>Burnside</rs> expedition is growing day by day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In its success are bound up the hopes of the nation, and on its success depends the continuance of the war; for if it fails there will be no more grand armadas to infest the <rs>Southern</rs> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>If it succeeds, there will be encouragement to new attempts, and we may look for scenes of rapine, plunder and brutal atrocities, unheard of since the days of <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> and his hand of buccaneers.

But <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> is no ordinary soothsayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Such failures do not in the least dispirithim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>His &#x0022;self- consciousness.&#x0022; as <placeName reg="Oakey Hall">Oakey Hall</placeName> calls <persName><roleName n="Massa">Massa</roleName> <foreName>Greeley</foreName></persName>'s vanity, is altogether too great to admit of a defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>He picks his prophetical flint and tries again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> This time he predicts a Northern civil war because <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> was not presented with a real sword for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Evidently he imagines that the <rs>Pathfinder</rs> intends to burke Honest Old Abe, transfix the <rs>Cabinet</rs> like pigeons on a skewer, and seize the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Conscious, however, that he is unprophetically behind the age, and that he has read in the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> that the <name>Abolition</name> conspiracy is unpopular, and only exhibits itself in certain non-combative ways, peculiar to the excitable <rs>Greeley</rs> and the virulent <rs>Philips</rs>, <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> shirts his ground and boisters up his prediction of a Northern civil war by the excessively subtle and abstruse arguments that the leading New York dailies are discussing their relative circulation, and that <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> has elected a new <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Therefore, says the oracular <rs>Russell</rs> of course we shall have a Northern civil war. <orgName n="Common Sense" type="newspaper">Common sense</orgName> people do not see the deduction, and thing the argument rather <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> obscure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>But then, is not obscurity a prophetic quality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Why, for <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years the world has been puzzling itself over some of the <name>Biblical</name> predictions, and can yet make nothing out of them.

To be oracular <num value="1">one</num> must be obscure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>What is the use of being a prophet if every <num value="1">one</num> can understand your reasons for your predictions? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> Nor is the objection less trivial that the reasons contradict the prophecy; for if the papers have no greater matter than their circulation to discuss, and if the people can become so excited about such an unimportant affair as a mayoralty election, then, certainly, there can be no great conspiracy brewing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>But is it not the privilege of a prophet to contradict himself, if he like?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>All religions have contradictory dogmas; and are we, therefore, to be without any religion?--Ah, no; <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="nearbymention:Russell,D.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> seems to write trash; but he knows more about this country, its people and institutions than even <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName>, who expounds our constitution for us, or the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, which informs us that we persecute British, residents and drive them out of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>When he sees conspiracy breeding in a newspaper discussion about circulation, and civil war pregnant in a chapter election, we folks who have not the girt of <hi rend="italics">double <num value="1">one</num></hi> had better be silent and look but for squalls. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>He throws the entire blame on <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, who he excuses on the score of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>We extract a few of the reading points of the speech: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> It should not be forgotten that this question was simply <num value="1">one</num> of law &mdash; just as was that of a matter of trespass between individuals; the object being to determine which was <num value="8">eight</num> and which was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>But it cannot be forgotten that, in times past, <hi rend="italics">on this identical point of law,</hi> <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> persistently held an opposite ground from that which she now takes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> There are yet other points, however, on which had the ship been carried into port for adjudication, controversy must have arisen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The <num value="3">three</num> following points have been presented: </p> 
<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>That the seizure of the rebel emissaries, without taking the ship into port, was wrong, inasmuch as a navy officer is not entitled to substitute himself for a judicial tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2">2</num>. That had the ship been carried into port, it would not have been liable on account of the rebel emissaries, inasmuch as neutral ships are free to carry all persons not apparently in the military and naval service of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3">3</num>. Are dispatches contraband of war, so as to render the ship liable to seizure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/></item> </list> 
<p> * * * * * * * * </p> 
<p> <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> then took up the point which has been made, that the steam-picket having on board the emissaries, was on this account liable to capture, and rebutted it. He said that the policy of our Government, most positively declared in its diplomatic and also attested in numerous treaties, leaves no room to doubt that a neutral ship, with belligerent passengers, (not in the military or naval service,) is not liable to capture, and therefore the whole proceeding was wrong, not only because the passengers were taken from the ship, but also because the ship, however guilty, morality, was not guilty, legally in receiving such passengers on board. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> * * * * * * * * </p> 
<p> Other authorities were cited also as clearly proving that according to <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> principles and practice the ship was not liable to capture on account of dispatches on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>And here against we have the concurring testimony of continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, especially of the <rs>French Government</rs>, in the recent letter of M. <num value="1000">Thousand</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> Of course this whole discussion proceeds on the assumption that the rebels are to be regarded as belligerents, which is the character already accorded to them by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It they are not regarded as belligerents, then the proceeding of <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> is undoubtedly illegal and void.
