<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We were prepared for it, by a review which we read a few weeks ago of a narrative of his sojourn at <placeName reg="Jeddoe, Portage, Ohio" key="tgn,2420040">Jeddo</placeName>, written by the <rs>English Ambassador</rs> there, who said that the authorities had ordered all foreigners to quit the island, and had murdered many of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The same writer says that the potentate who signed the treaty with <persName n="Perry,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Perry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Perry</surname></persName> was put to death, and that the aristocracy, who much resemble the barons of the fundal system in the middle ages of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, both with respect to the independence of their power and their relations to the crown, had all determined that none of the treaties made with the powers of Christendom should be carried into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Of course <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, as well as <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle, will be down upon the unfortunate <rs>Asiatics</rs>, and we shall see a repetition of the crimes which made <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> an Aceldama and deluged <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> with blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> This is the hardest case that has ever come under our observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <rs>Japanese</rs>, since the expulsion of the <name>Jesuits</name>, <measure n="250years" type="date">two hundred and fifty years</measure> ago, have obstinately refused, as they certainly had a right to refuse, all intercourse with Christendom, except a very limited <num value="1">one</num> with the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>No <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nation &mdash; not even <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, their nearest and most ambitious neighbors &mdash; ever thought of interfering with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>To the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> alone are we to ascribe the intrusion upon them which has been witnessed of late years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>On the heads of that infernal race will fall all the blood and crime that is about to startle the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They forced themselves on the <name>Japanese</name>, just as they have been in the habit of forcing themselves upon society in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <rs>Japanese</rs> did not seek their company, and did not want it.--We wish to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> it were possible for them to sink every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ship and slaughter every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldier that may be sent against them. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> --When the <name>Register</name> of the <name>Treasury</name>, <persName n="Tyler,Mister,Robert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Tyler,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>, said that our finances were the weak point of our defences, he spoke a very painful, but a very apparent, and, let us add, a very useful truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Since an officer so high in the esteem of the <rs>Government</rs> has not hesitated to proclaim such a fact, and to prove it by statistics, we presume that newspapers will no longer be charged with a desire to render the public distrustful of the currency, when they venture to hint that it is somewhat redundant and ought to be curtailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In fact, we can see neither sense nor policy in attempting to conceal a truth which is obvious to the whole world &mdash; a defect which can be cured only by concentrating public thought upon it. That the circulation of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> reached at <num value="1">one</num> time <measure n="624000000dollars" type="currency">$624,000,000</measure>; that it is still within a fraction of <measure n="500000000dollars" type="currency">$500,000,000</measure>, and that the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s estimate of its capacity of endurance is far above the mark, are truths which ought to be known to the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When the crash of <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> --the greatest and most extensive that the world had witnessed since the explosion of <persName n="Law,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> scheme in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and the <rs type="place">South Sea</rs> bubble in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> &mdash; took place, the circulation of the whole country &mdash; <rs type="color">gold</rs>, <rs type="color">silver</rs>, and notes &mdash; although the population was over <num value="25000000">25,000,000</num>, was only <measure n="214000000dollars" type="currency">$214,000,000</measure> and a fraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Yet it was the redundancy of the currency that occasioned the explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Any man, therefore, who has a grain of common sense must see the danger of a country, numbering <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7000000">seven millions</num> of inhabitants, in which a circulation <num value="3">three</num> times as large as that which produced this great calamity is in existence, and we cannot see the object to be gained by refraining to comment upon it. The whole country already knows all about it, and perfectly understands the consequences, unless a stop be put to further issues, and the volume of the outstanding notes be reduced to <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of its present bulk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The great question is, How is this to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The tax will do much; but <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>'s remorseless <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing press</rs> threatens to neutralize all the benefit that otherwise might be expected from it. While it is estimated that the tax will call in old issues, or prevent new ones, to the amount of <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure>, <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">assignats</hi> are pouring forth from his fatal machine at the rate of <measure n="50000000dollars" type="currency">$50,000,000</measure> a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Unless it can be stopped we see no good to be derived from either the tax or the sale of the cotton loan bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Doubtless some steps will be taken to that end by Congress, unless we are to be overwhelmed by these <hi rend="italics">assignats.</hi> If it can possibly be arrested, then, we think, the tax and the cotton loan might be so managed as to cause a reduction equal to the demands of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> When <persName><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>., upon getting possession of the throne, found the finances of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in an embarrassed condition, and no money in the treasury, he conceived the idea of relieving the national necessities by means of what he terms the <hi rend="italics">credit mobilizer</hi> --that is, a national loan, in which every individual of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> should partake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The loan was advertised &mdash; the <rs>Emperor</rs> made a strong appeal to the people &mdash; nearly every man, woman and child in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> took a share &mdash; and it was all taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Every person was allowed to subscribe according to his or her ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Some took a whole share, some <num value="0.5">a half</num>, some <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, some <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>, and so on. Now, people may say what they please of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and we ourselves sometimes criticise his acts pretty freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He has made many mistakes of course, for he is a man, and subject to the natural laws that regulate the human mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>To say that he occasionally blunders, is but to say that he is human.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Nevertheless, he is <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable men of this or any other age, and the people at large know it, as well as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and <rs n="European" type="group">Europeans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They are conscious that he has made as few mistakes as any man probably could have made in his situation, and that with the smallest means over placed in the hands of a revolutionary leader, he has contrived to carry on a war more tremendous than any ever waged against <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They see all this, and their confidence in him is unbounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>If he will issue a proclamation appealing to the whole people to come forward and take this cotton loan, in the way the loan of <persName><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>was taken, our word for it, it will all be taken in a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> hope he will try it; and if he feels diffident of his influence, let him recollect the manner in which the people have responded to every proclamation he has issued. </p> </div3>
