<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Quite a handsome <dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>New Year's</occasion></dateStruct> gift to the <rs>Government</rs>, wasn't it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>An expedition like the present <num value="1">one</num> had been talked of for a long time, but we had despaired of its ever being executed, until our present gallant leader came among us. His arrival inspired us with fresh hopes, and his skill and energy enabled us to put into action our hitherto fruitless desire to inflick a blow upon our common enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> may well be proud of her many noble sons who are heading our armies, and of none more justly so than of the &#x0022;dashing Maguler.&#x0022; History will wreathe his brow with unfading laurels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But to my account. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> All the preparations having been completed, the night of the <date value="1862-12-31">31st of 1862,</date> found us silently marching along the road from the bridge to <placeName reg="Galveston city">Galveston city</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The distance was only <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, and as the plan was to reach the city about <num value="2">2</num> o'clk A. M. we had plenty of time to make the trip leisurely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our forces consisted of several regiments of infantry and about <num value="22">22</num> pieces of artillery, though the principal attack was to be made by the artillery, as there were only about <num value="310">310</num> of the enemy in the city, and they were behind a barricade at the cuter end of the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The night was a lovely <num value="1">one</num>; the moon looked down upon us, as we stole along, as peacefully as if there was no such thing as war. Perhaps it was in deference to her known prejudices on the subject that <persName n="Magruder,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Magruder,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> postponed the attack until she had disappeared length the horizon, which occurred about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time>. Be that as it may, she would have witnessed a very pretty <num value="8">eight</num> if she had deferred setting an hour or <num value="2">two</num> longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Well, we reached the suburbs of the city about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time>. The streets were completely deserted; the few inhabitants who had remained in the city were sleeping soundly, and had we not awaked and warned then of their danger they would have slept on until the cannon's roar had startled them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Our march through the city was certainly the most quiet procession I ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><num value="1">One</num> might a most have imagined that we were so many ghosts, following the old year to his burial, except that ghosts in the matter of dress have a great partiality for white as a color, and our costume was, as you may suppose, none of the fairest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But it is not surprising that our usually noisy <placeName reg="Texan">Texan</placeName> boys were quiet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The scene, the dead hour of night, and the fact that this was to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle of many of them, all conspired to make them serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Then, too, the great heavy waves came tumbling and roming in from the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, chanting out upon the still night sir, as they dashed along, something that sounded amazingly like a funeral dirge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But onward we stole, through long, lonely streets now around this corner and now turning that, until at length we reached <address><street n="Strand street">Strand street</street></address>, which guns parallel with the water, and is the next <num value="1">one</num> to the wharves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The moon was now down, and everything was enveloped in darkness; the guns were noiselessly placed in position and loaded the men looking like so many shadows as they took their places in the gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There, within <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>, lay the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs>, the <name>Owasso</name>, the <rs>Clifton</rs>, and <num value="2">two</num> other boats, with their broadsides turned towards us, and ready to open upon us the moment we fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This we knew, for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had been ashore the day before and told the people that they knew all about our plans, and were waiting for us. In fact, they were so certain of victory that they allowed us to place our guns in position without firing upon us. All being ready, our gallant General opened the attack by firing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun. In a few moments the bright flashes, the booming reports, and whizzing shells told plainer than words that the action had begun in earnest, for the next hour the roar of cannon was incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The clear, been crack of our little lifted guns, the dull sound of our seacoast howitzers, and the mighty thundering bass of the columbiads and <num value="100">100</num>-pound <name type="weapon">Parrott guns</name> on the gunboats combined to form a piece of music that might well have been dedicated to the <rs>King</rs> of Pandemonium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> gun on the <rs type="place">Scarlets Lane</rs> that really seemed to threw lamp posts; plunging through a large brick house was nothing but fan for those big fellows; in they went at <num value="1">one</num> side and out at the other, leaving a hole through which a horse and cars might pass.--As for bricks, window-blinds places of plank, and such things they flew around in the most reckless manner, evidently viewing with the shells and carrier in making our boys below uncomfortable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> This state of things continued for what seemed to me about <num value="1">one</num> lunar month, though some of my friends and all the other correspondents concur in the opinion that it was only <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. I suppose the discrepancy occurred from my measuring time by my feelings and they by their watches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Up to this time, which was just before daylight, nothing had been heard from our boats which were to have made the attack simultaneously with us. The light had raged furiously on both sides, but was fast becoming evident that our land forces alone were no match for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> boats, with their great guns and mortars, which vomited <num value="0.5">a half</num> pushed of grape and canister at us at a pop. How any of us ceased without receiving <num value="1">one</num> of those nasty pills as a new year a gift, is a mystery to me, for the <name>Janks</name> distributed them in the most miscellaneous and lavish manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>By the way, talking about gifts let us give the devil his due and admit that in the articles of shell, grape, canister, etc., the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are generous however parsimonious and close they may be in other things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Won't the <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">army of Virginia</orgName> and our <placeName reg="Texan">Texan</placeName> boys there admit that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Strange to say, though so much ammunition had been expended, as yet very few casualties had occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>To me, being, a novice in such matters, the thing seemed positively inexplicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I accounted for it by attributing it to the special <rs>Providence</rs> which has descreed that balls <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">et omne genus</hi></foreign> should be blind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If any other observer on the subject has any other or better explanation to offer we should be glad to bear it. As far as I could learn, <persName n="Sherman,,Lt,Sydney,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Sherman,Lt,Sydney,,"><foreName>Lt</foreName> <foreName>Sydney</foreName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sherman,IsFather-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,Lt,Sydney,,"><roleName n="IsFather-General">son of Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, was the only officer who had as yet been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He fell early in the action, while nobly fighting the gun which he commanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The ball which struck him --a Minie &mdash; entered his left side and lodged, inflicking a mortal wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He was taken to the <name>Convent</name>, which was used as a hospital, where, after lingering a few hours, he calmly breathed his last, another offering on the altar of his country <persName n="McMahon,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McMahon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>McMahon</surname></persName> was shot through the ankle while gallantly commanding his battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Several of his men were wounded though I was unable to learn their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Might of <persName n="Odium,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Odium,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Odium</surname></persName>'s men had also been wounded though none mortally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I forgot to meet on that early in the engagement a charge was made by <num value="300">300</num> of our infantry on <num value="3">three</num> companies of the <orgName type="regiment" key="42MARegiment">42d Massachusetts regiment</orgName>, stationed behind a barricade at the end of <placeName reg="Kuhuts wharf">Kuhuts wharf</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The enemy had torn up the planks from the wharf and made a breastwork of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Our boys rushed out into the water with their sealing ladders and dashed up them, but the position was too strong and they had to retire, leaving our artillery to shell them out. We lost some <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> in this charge, and would have lost more, but it was pitchy dark and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> fired very will dy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Daylight at length arrived and every <num value="1">one</num> was seriously looking for our boats, which ought to have been up <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> before, as was forwards learned, they had come down within light at about <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, and, bearing nothing of us, retired fire or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>, under the impress on that the land attack had been postponed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>There they waited until about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time>, when the land attack begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>To that end, a uniform currency, in which taxes, subscriptions to loans, and all other ordinary public dues may be paid is almost, if not quite indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Such a currency can be furnished by banking associations authorized under a general act of Congress, as suggested in my message at the beginning of the present <unclear> </unclear> on.
