<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> There is in many of the hospitals, perhaps in all, a great want of nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Our ladies, it is true, have exerted themselves nobly in behalf of our heroic and suffering soldiers, but not, a few of them have themselves become broken down by their exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>There must be a large number of persons in this city who have leisure enough to attend to these duties, and who might be enrolled in an organization for this purpose, as is sometimes the case in cities visited by pestilence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The wounded require attention, not of an onerous kind, but in applying water to the wounds, which become exceedingly painful when dry, and in supplying them with feed, which they ought to receive often, though in small quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>From want of such light attentions as these, so easily rendered, and which any child might perform, many a gallant fellow may suffer and die. We know that we have a multitude of warm and generous hearts among us, but have we no <persName n="Howard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Howard,nomatch:0"><surname>Howard</surname></persName> or <persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="mostcommon:Nightingale,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName>, who can suggest and organize means of making effective the sympathies of the public in everything connected with the relief of our soldiers? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>If these men were our enemies, it would be barbarous to neglect their wants; but our friends, our champions, our deliverers, languishing, and some of them dying from wounds received for their country, who have bought our safety with their best blood can there be more monstrous ingratitude and <unclear>in </unclear> then to omit any means which may be necessary to <unclear>alle </unclear> their pangs and save their lives? </p> </div3>
