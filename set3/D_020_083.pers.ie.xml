<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>The enemy then approached us on the west side, sending their shell and cannon balls before them, almost into the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>We soon discovered that this force was small, and only intended, by loud demonstrations, to draw us off. We kept a howitzer and a small party to watch them, and employed our main force in skirmishing with the principal body. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/> The day was spent without any collision, except an occasional encounter between the advanced guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>The enemy kept bushed, and of course we could not charge upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>The sun was about setting; they were all around us, and reported to be <num value="5000">5,000</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>We had <num value="350">350</num> cavalry and <num value="150">150</num> militia to depend upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>After holding a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> we concluded to fall back <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> upon the <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>We did so, taking bag and baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>The next morning a message reached us that the scoundrels had entered <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName>, and that a few of the militia were firing upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/> By common consent of the men and officers, and without many commands or words, we saddled up, mounted, and in a few minutes were galloping back at the utmost speed of our horses, sending clouds of dust to the skies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>The enemy were by some means apprised of our coming a short time before we reached town, and tool up the double-quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>We dashed into the town at lightning speed, shouting at the top of our voices, and making the air ring with the clashing of sabres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were half a mile ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>The head of our column dashed up within <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure>, dismounted and opened fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>We soon came up with the last wing, leaped a fence, and gained a position nearer and in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> round from &#x0022;<placeName reg="Brock's Gap">Brock's Gap</placeName>&#x0022; made them take up double-quick again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>They sent a volley or <num value="2">two</num> at us, which did no damage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/> The whole of our cavalry now joined and pursued them to the <rs>Northwest</rs> pass, a narrow defile, <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>We had now ascertained their numbers not to exceed <num value="1500">1,500</num>, though the day previous we had stood our ground against the phantom of <num value="5000">5,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>But was it prudent to advance through such a defile with <num value="350">350</num> cavalry against <num value="1500">1,500</num> well-armed infantry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>We paused not to consider, but sending a shell or <num value="2">two</num> from a howitzer after them, at <orgName n="command"><persName n="Funsten,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00445" reg="mostcommon:Funsten,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Funsten</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, I dashed through with my company as skirmishers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/> The enemy were just beyond, preparing to take a meal, and not dreaming that we would follow them through the pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Upon sight of us they took to double-quick again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>I followed up pretty closely, and arrested <num value="1">one</num> man who had fallen back from fatigue, took his gun and sent him to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Pretty soon the whole command came up and on we pushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>A few minutes brought us in sight of the retreating foe. They drew up in line of battle, and fired their volleys at us, which we answered in marksman style, bringing many of them to the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>They gathered up their dead, and off they took again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/> We hurried on through the mountains, through narrow defiles and thickets until dark for <measure n="16miles" type="distance">sixteen miles</measure>, fighting them throughout the whole day. They were run to the verge of death, and had it not been for some misunderstanding of orders, which caused us at <num value="1">one</num> time to fire upon our own men, we would have flanked them, and in their tired condition captured the whole of them, along with their baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>As it was, we killed and wounded great numbers, took <measure n="5" type="prisoners">five prisoners</measure>, a number of guns, <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> horses, and run the broken-down enemy in sight of their camp at New crock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>A reliable lady told us they passed her house with <num value="3">three</num> wagon-loads of dead and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>They having a reserve force at New <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, we concluded to return to <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName>, as we and our horses also were much fatigued, and in no condition to encounter fresh troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/> Thus ended an exploit by the much abused <persName n="McDonald,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00446" reg="nearbymention:McDonald,Emmett,,,"><surname>McDonald</surname></persName> cavalry, which, I think, has not been equalled in daring during the war.
