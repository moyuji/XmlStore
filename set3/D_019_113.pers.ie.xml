<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> In Convention at <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>,<date value="1861-05-13">May 13th, 1861,</date><persName n="Fulter,Doctor,Richard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Fulter,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Fulter</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Md.</placeName>, from the <rs>Committee</rs> on the <rs>State</rs> of the <name>Country</name>, made the following. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> report: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We hold this truth to be self-evident, that Government are established for the security, prosperity and happiness of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>When, therefore, any Government is perverted from its proper design, becomes oppressive, and abuses its power, the people have a right to change it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> As to the <name>States</name> once combined upon this continent, it is now manifest that they can no longer live together as <num value="1">one</num> Confederacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The Union constituted by our fore fathers was <num value="1">one</num> of co-equal sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The fanatical spirit of the <rs>North</rs> has long been seeking to deprive us of rights and franchises guaranteed by the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and, after years of persistent aggression, they have at last accomplished their purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> In vindication of their sacred rights and honor, in self-defence, and for the protection of all which is dear to man, the <rs>Southern States</rs> have practically asserted the right of seceding from a Union so degenerated from that established by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and they have formed for themselves a Government based upon the principles of the original compact &mdash; adopting a charter which secures to each State its sovereign rights and privileges. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> This new Government, in thus dissolving former political connections, seeks to cultivate relations of amity and good will with its late confederates, and with all the world; and they have thrice sent special commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> with overtures for peace, and for a fair, amicable adjustment of all difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The Government at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> has insultingly repelled these reasonable proposals, and now insists upon devastating our land with fire and sword, upon letting loose hordes of armed soldiers to pillage and desolate the entire <rs>South</rs>, for the purpose of forcing the seceded States back into unnatural Union, or of subjugating them and holding them as conquered provinces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> While the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the land are thus swayed against each other, it might naturally have been hoped that at least the <rs>Churches</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> would interpose and protest against this appeal to the sword, this invoking of civil war, this deluging the country in fratricidal blood; but with astonishment and grief we find churches and pastors of the <rs>North</rs> breathing out slaughter and clamoring for sanguinary hostilities with a fierceness which we would have supposed impossible among the disciples of the <rs>Prince</rs> of Peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In view of such premises, this Convention cannot keep silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Recognizing the necessity that the whole moral influence of the people, in whatever capacity or organization, should be enlisted in aid of the rulers, who, by their suffrages have been called to defend the endangered interests of person and property, of honor and liberty, it is bound to utter its voice distinctly, decidedly, emphatically; and your Committee recommend, therefore, the subjoined resolutions: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> I beg leave to put to my noble friend, the <name>Under</name>-<rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> for Foreign Affairs, a question of which I have given him private notice, in reference to a subject which deeply interests this country, and, I may say, the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Almost all your lordships have, no doubt, read the accounts which arrived this morning from <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName>, and must have learnt with pain, as well as some astonishment, that a civil war had broken out between the <name>Secessionists</name> in that country and the other States of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Fortunately, up to the date of those accounts, hardly any blood had been shed, and too much praise cannot, I think, be bestowed upon the commander of the fleet engaged in the transaction to which I refer, for abstaining from entering on a useless contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It is impossible, however, that a struggle such as that which seems now impending in <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> &mdash; a struggle so unnatural, and calculated, I may add, to prove so fatal to the parties concerned in it &mdash; should not produce a reverberation throughout the rest of the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> I may further observe that no country on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> is perhaps more likely to suffer from the civil war which threatens the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than our own; for, altogether apart from those feelings of regret with which we must witness the breaking out of strife between persons belonging to the same family as ourselves, and kindred to us in language as well as in blood, our political and material interests are deeply involved in this unhappy schism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>That being so, I cannot but believe that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Ministers, feeling upon this question with all <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> subjects, have already done their utmost by officious means to bring about some arrangement by which so dreadful a calamity as that of which I am speaking may be averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>I therefore wish to ask my noble friend what steps the <rs>Government</rs> have taken with that object; whether they have made any attempt to prevent the quarrel between the different States of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> from coming to a bloody issue; what hopes they entertain of succeeding in so lendable an endeavor, and whether they have invited, or are in correspondence with, any other <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Government with the view of obtaining their assistance in seeking to put a stop at the outset to a civil war, of which, if once fairly commenced, it will be impossible to foresee the end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>We have also received with the utmost concern the accounts to which my noble friend has alluded, informing us that these dissensions have brought that country to the brink of civil war, if, indeed, civil war may not be said to have already broken out within her territories; and in answer to the question, what steps have been taken by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Ministers to avert this great calamity &mdash; for a great calamity it undoubtedly must prove to be not only to the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> themselves, but to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which is so closely connected with them by the ties of kindred &mdash; I have to state that after the most mature deliberation the <rs>Government</rs> came to the conclusion that it was not desirable that this country should intrude her advice or counsel on the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> However great the interest which we may feel in the welfare of her people, and however anxious we might be to rescue them from the misfortune which appears to be impending over their heads, we yet thought that a great and independent nation might not welcome advice given with respect to her internal affairs, if that advice were proffered without being solicited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The instructions, therefore, given to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> were, that he should, on every fitting occasion, express the earnest desire entertained by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government that the differences which prevail between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States of <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> should be arranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>That is the answer I have to give to the question of my noble friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It reveals to that people that the true sources of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> power and prosperity are Southward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It shows that the shipping which met that of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in every port on the globe belongs only to the <rs>North</rs>; that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> goods which competed with their own in all the open markets of the world, even in the markets of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, came altogether from Northern factories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Nay, more; it teaches them that the monopoly which the <rs>North</rs> possessed of the <rs>Southern</rs> markets and of the <rs>Southern</rs> coasting trade, built up, enriched, and strengthened Northern manufactures and the <rs>Northern</rs> marine to the degree which enabled that section to wage so successfully with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> a dangerous rivalry and competition in these branches of enterprise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> The merchants and manufacturers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are beginning to see in the <rs>South</rs> not merely a source for the supply of cotton and other leading staples, but a new market for <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> goods heretofore closed against all the world except the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They are awakening to the fact that, in the coasting trade of this great section, a new field for the enterprise of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> shipping is now opened, from which it has heretofore been driven off by our jealous navigation laws. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> It has been the policy of the <rs>North</rs> to prejudice the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> mind against our section, and by every artifice to depreciate us in <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> estimation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It has been its study to conceal the resources of the <rs>South</rs>, and to envelope its concerns in a cloud of obscurity and prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>As a fortunate prospector in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> conceals the discovery of a rich placer from all around, and toils in secrecy and silence, by day and night, in extracting its precious nuggets of gold; so has the <rs>North</rs> with jealous eye kept guard upon the <rs>South</rs>, while enriching itself from her exhaustless treasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The war interrupts this most profitable game of avarice and plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It brings the <rs>South</rs> prominently forth to the eye of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from the clouds of defamation and ignorance which had enveloped her; and it discloses to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that, in all matters of commerce, while the <rs>North</rs> is her natural rival, the <rs>South</rs> is her natural ally.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> But the material wealth of the <rs>South</rs> is not all that the war will disclose to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>All who know this venerable Diocesan will recognize in this expression of his views the wisdom, firmness, and piety which they are accustomed to associate with his honored name: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/> Having thus presented a statement of those things pertaining to our Diocese which the canon requires of me, I now ask your attention to a few remarks concerning the present unhappy condition of our State and country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/> My brethren and friends will bear me witness how carefully I have ever avoided, in all my communications, the least reference to anything partaking of a political character, and how I have earnestly warned my younger brethren against the danger of injuring the effect of their sacred ministry, by engaging in discussions which are so apt to disturb the peace of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>But in the present circumstances of our country the cause of religion is so deeply involved, that I feel not only justified but constrained to offer a few remarks for your consideration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/> It has pleased <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to permit a great calamity to come upon us. Our whole country is preparing for war. Our own State, after failing in her earnest effort for the promotion of peace, is, perhaps, more actively engaged in all needful measures for maintaining the position which she has, after much consideration, deliberately assumed, than any portion of the land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> A deeper and more honest conviction that if war should actually come upon us it will be on our part <num value="1">one</num> of self-defence, and, therefore, justifiable before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, seldom, if ever, aminated the breasts of those who appealed to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>From this consideration and from my knowledge of the character of our people, I believe that the object sought for will be most perseveringly pursued, whatever sacrifice of life and comfort and treasure may be required.--Nor do I entertain any doubt as to the final result, though I shudder at the thought of what may intervene before that result is secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in great mercy and with His mighty power, interpose and grant us speedy peace, instead of protracted war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>But can it be, that at this period of the world, when so many prayers are offered up for the establishment of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00514" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s kingdom in, all the earth, and such high hopes are entertained that the zealous efforts put forth will be successful, and our country be <num value="1">one</num> of the most effective and honored instruments for producing the same, that the great work shall be arrested by such a fratricidal war as that which is now so seriously threatened?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>is there not room enough for us all to dwell together in peace in this widely extended country, so large a portion of which is not yet unsettled, and may not be until the world that now is shall be no more?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The families or nations which sprung from <num value="2">two</num> venerable patriarchs of old, could find room enough in the little pent up land of Judea to live in peace, by going the <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="1">one</num> hand and the other to the opposite.--At a later period, when <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Judas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00515" reg="mostcommon:Judas,nomatch:0"><surname>Judas</surname></persName> separated, and the latter having the city and temple in possession, and the supremacy, according to prophecy, was preparing to go up against the former and reduce the people to submission and bring them back to union, the <rs>Lord</rs> himself came down and forbade it, saying; <hi rend="italics">Thou shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren, the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>Return every man to his house, for this thing is of me.&#x0022;</hi> and they hearkened unto the <rs>Lord</rs>, and ever latter the history of the <num value="2">two</num> kingdoms is written in the same sacred volume in which are also recorded the evidence of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> favor to both, and though sometimes at controversy, yet how often were they found side by side defending the ancient boundaries of Judea against surrounding nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant that our country may learn a lesson from this sacred narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Let none think that I am unmindful of law and order and of the blessings of Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>I was trained in a different school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>I have clung with tenacity to the hope of preserving the <rs>Union</rs> to the last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>If I know my own heart, could the sacrifice of the poor remnant of my life have contributed in any degree to its maintenance, such sacrifice would have been cheerfully made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>But the developments of public feeling and the course of our rulers have brought me slowly, reluctantly, sorrowfully, yet most decidedly, to the painful conviction that notwithstanding attendant dangers and evils we shall consult the welfare and happiness of the whole land by separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>And who can desire to retain a Union which has now become so hateful and by the application of armed force, which if successful would make it tenfold more hateful, and soon lead to the repetition of the same bloody contests? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> I trust, therefore, that the present actual separation of so many and such important portions of our country may take place with out further collision, which might greatly hinder the establishment of the most friendly and intimate relations which can consist with separate establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>I trust that our friends at a distance, and now in opposition to us, will most seriously review their judgment, and inquire whether the evils resulting from a war to sustain their wishes and opinions as to a single Confederacy, will not far exceed those apprehended from the establishment of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>--an event far more certain than the result of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution at the time of its occurrence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/> In connection with this civil and geographical separation in our country, and almost necessarily resulting from it, subjects of some change of the ecclesiastical relations of our Diocese must come under consideration.--There is a general and strong desire, I believe, to retain as much as possible of our past and present happy intercourse with those from whom we shall be in other matters more divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>A meeting is already proposed for this purpose in <num value="1">one</num> of the seceded States, whose plans, so far as developed, I will submit to the consideration of this body at its present session. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/> I cannot conclude without expressing the earnest desire that the ministers and members of our Church, and all the citizens of our State, who are so deeply interested in the present contest, may conduct it in the most elevated and <name>Christian</name> spirit, rising above unworthy and uncharitable imputations on all who are opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Many there are equally sincere on both sides, as there ever have been in all the wars and controversies that have been waged upon earth; though it does not follow that all have the same grounds of justice and truth on which to base their warfare. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>While abhorring, as I am sure we all do, the former part of this cold-hearted maxim, let us cherish and adopt the latter, so congenial with the spirit of our holy religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>From personal knowledge of many of them, and from the information of others, there is already, I believe, a large portion of religious principle and genuine piety to be found among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>I rejoice to learn that in many companies not only are the services of chaplains and other ministers earnestly sought for and after, but social prayer meetings held among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Our own Church has a very large proportion of communicants among the officers of our army, and not a few among the soldiers.
