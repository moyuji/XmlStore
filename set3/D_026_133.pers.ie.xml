<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday was a day of excitement in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>At a very early hour of the morning our inhabitants were aroused from their slumbers by heavy and incessant reports of artillery, which seemed to extend from the right to the left of our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As usual, many rumors were in circulation during the day, but everything subsided towards evening under a knowledge of the fact that the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms were everywhere victorian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Below we give a summary of recent <unclear>operations</unclear> on the lines. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>From <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> In the engagement of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> <unclear></unclear> was complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, commanding <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s carps, attacked the enemy's right, driving them at all points, and capturing over <measure n="700" type="prisoners">700 prisoners</measure>, including commissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>An official <unclear></unclear> from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, received late the <unclear></unclear> says we drone the enemy from <placeName key="possibilities=50" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Turkey Hill</placeName>, thereby gaining an important position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>As night closed in upon the <unclear></unclear>, our men rested upon their arms in triumph, having suffered but small loss, and <unclear></unclear> severe punishment upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Our position, which is naturally a strong <num value="1">one</num>, with the right resting upon <unclear></unclear> Chickahominy at <placeName reg="Sparrow's house">Sparrow's house</placeName>, was made stronger during the night, and every preparation made for a severe battle on the following day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Whether it was the purpose of our commanders to renew the attack yesterday morning or not, we do not know, but if it was, the arrangement was anticipated by the enemy, who, soon after daylight, made <unclear></unclear> attack in heavy force upon the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">first corps</orgName> (<persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s) on the light, and the conflict gradually spread along the line to the left, where it raged with great intensity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A witness of the fight says that amid the heavy roil of musketry and almost deafening sound of cannon, he could at times hear the trampolinist yells of our men, as they hurled back the enemy reliantly, inflicting heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is a singular coincidence that the lines occupied yesterday were nearly the some as those of the memorable <date value="1862-06-02">2d of June, 1862.</date> that of the enemy being near that held by <placeName reg="Fort Mc">Mc</placeName>.Cletian when he made his final stand before being driven from the field of Cold <unclear> </unclear>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> A dispatch from the battle field, dated at <unclear></unclear> o'clock, says: <q>&#x0022;All goes on well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We repulsed the enemy with ease, inflicting heavy loss in front of <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s, Holie's, and a portion of <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The enemy was repulsed <num value="7">seven</num> times by <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s <unclear></unclear>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/></p> 
<p> At <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> the enemy, driven back at all points, ceased firing, and remained comparatively quiet during the day. It is reported that we took <measure n="800" type="prisoners">800 prisoners</measure>. A <unclear></unclear> officer, who left the front at <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, says that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s staff estimated the enemy's loss as great as that in the <rs n="Battle of the Wilderness" type="battle">battle of the Wilderness</rs>, if not greater, while ours was migrainous slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This is confirmed by the statement of our army correspondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>An excited courier who come in yesterday reported that <measure n="25000" type="dead">25,000 dead</measure> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> lay in front of our works, and that <num value="1">one</num> field of <measure n="5acres" type="area">five acres</measure> was literally piled with dead bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This may be regarded as a rather extravagant assertion; but that their loss was very heavy admits of no doubt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> A wounded <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officer, who was brought down last evening, stated that they designed the attack of yesterday as a general <num value="1">one</num>, hoping doubtless to take a step in advance towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, or to gain the road to unite with <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Brast,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, both of which design were happily thwarted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> <num value="2">Two</num> sections of the <placeName reg="Letcher, Sanborn, South Dakota" key="tgn,2097321">Letcher</placeName> battery were brought into action yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They received their fire until the enemy got well up, when they opened with grape and canister, mowing great gaps through their ranks and driving them back in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The battery lost not a man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Much of the fighting on the centre was done by <orgName n="Poagne's Battery"><persName n="Poagne,Battery,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Poagne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Battery"></roleName><surname>Poagne</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, which sustained itself handsomely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Among our wounded officers are <persName n="Capers,Colonel,H.,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Capers,H.,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Capers</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, in the thigh, not dangerously; and <persName n="Baker,Adjutant,Frank,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Baker,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Adjutant">Adjutant</roleName> <foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Baker</surname></persName>, of the same regiment, whose leg has been amputated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>He expressed himself in favor of peace, and deprecated a single hour more of war, seeing in its continuance &#x0022;the seeds of debt, military ambition and despotism, against which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will demand a virtue and intelligence in the masses such as history nowhere shows. &#x0022; He professed himself profoundly humiliated at the sight of negro soldiers. &#x0022;The most humiliating hour I ever lived,&#x0022; he says, &#x0022;was when <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of white men, having ground the negro to powder under their heels in the death grapple with the <rs>South</rs>, were obliged to get down on their knees and ask the negro to help them fight.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Even such a man can see the damning infamy in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> people have involved themselves by the employment of negro soldiers, desirous as he is to carry through the nefarious projects of the <name>Abolitionists</name> by any and every means, fair or foul, honest or dishonest.--How then must it appear to the rest of mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Here is a nation, <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> strong, boasting of its strength and its resources, as no nation ever boasted before, possessing unlimited means of aggression, an army of half a <num value="1000000">million</num>, a navy of <num value="600">600</num> vessels, unlimited supplies of arms, ammunition, and all the appliances of war, having access by means of its ships to all parts of the world, receiving annually <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of immigrants, at least half of whom are turned into soldiers as soon as they land &mdash; warring upon <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of people, who have no ships, whose ports are all blockaded, who in the beginning had neither arms, nor munitions of war, nor credit, nor money &mdash; and so utterly unable to overcome them, as to be obliged to incite their slaves to insurrection, and beg them to help them fight!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>All history fails to present a spectacle of parallel degradation; and what makes it worse is that this nation, thus humiliated, was and is the most boastful, lying, presumptuous nation that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Their newspapers constantly talk about &#x0022;whipping all creation,&#x0022; and the belief is general among the masses that they can defy the world in arms.

But he declined their overtures for the reason that it would give a ferocious turn to the war, causing horrible devastation and unheard of murders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>He should, he said, be espousing the cause of barbarism against civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>He could not for a moment entertain the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Be it remembered that the <rs>Russian</rs> serf was a white man, of the same race with his master, and fully as capable of improvement; whereas the negro is of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> descent, and has never been left to himself in any part of the world without degenerating into a barbarian.
