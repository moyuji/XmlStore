<div5 type="entry" n="1">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Yesterday, at the close of a heavy gale, when had lasted for <measure n="60hours" type="date">sixty hours</measure>, it was reported by the officer of the deck that a battery, whose existence had been previously unknown to us, situated on <placeName reg="Lyanhaven Bay">Lyanhaven Bay</placeName>, had opened fire upon the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">John Clark</rs>, of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, which had arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7008927" n="1.000 4" reg="le havre,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Havre</placeName> the day previous, and, anchoring in the bay during the gale, with <num value="2">two</num> anchors down, had dragged within its range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We could see the enemy's shell dropping about the ship in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In a short time we ran down to the ship, and opened a brisk fire upon the battery, which was as vigorously returned and sustained for <measure n="40minutes" type="date">forty minutes</measure>, when having effectually silenced their guns and thrown several broadsides into them, which elicited, however, no response, they having <q>&#x0022;shot up shop,&#x0022;</q> we turned our attention towards extricating the ship from her perilous<unclear/> position, which we finally did by sending a part of our crew on board and getting her off, under her canvas, having failed in several attempts to get a line aboard of her to tow her off, owing to the heavy sea and strong tide prevailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This occupied <measure n="1.5hours" type="date">one and a half hours</measure> after we had fired the last shot, giving our adversary every opportunity to renew the combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Finally, we got under way and anchored near the outer light-ship, and, while ruminating over the events of the day, were run foul of by the <rs>John Clark</rs> as she stood for her anchorage, smashing a portion of our upper works, starting several knees forward, carrying away <num value="1">one</num> of the flukes of our anchor, and doing other damage &mdash; throwing herself into our aims, as it were, with an unwieldy gratitude for which we were entirely unprepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <rs>Clark</rs> was struck once or twice, I believe, by fragments of shells, but sustained no material damage, and this morning in charge of a pilot, stood on up the bay towards <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>. </p> </div5>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Concealing himself, he allowed the boat to reach the canal aqueduct, when he challenged them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Instead of answering the challenge, the leader said to the others, <q>&#x0022;Boys, by G &mdash; d they've got us, pull back like h &mdash; l.&#x0022;</q> The sentinel gave the alarm and fired, wounding or killing at least, <num value="1">one</num> of the party, but before he could receive assistance or load his piece they were bearing upon them, and the boat and crew consequently escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The spot where this occurred is near the farm of a man named Cross, and the men in the boat were probably his friends coming to communicate with him, or ascertain his fate, as well as to get inside our encampments and report their condition, positions, and movements to the rebel leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>In beauty and fertility, it is a Paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>No other island, no other spot of earth in the <rs>Western Hemisphere</rs>, deserves to be named in the same day with it. Yet this principal pearl in the old colonial diadem of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> has been cast before swine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, in a foolish freak of revolutionary folly, gave over Hayti to the dominion of barbarism, and she owes it to the civilization of <sic>thie</sic> age to undo the mischief she has done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>In a review of <hi rend="italics">Soulouque and his Empire,</hi> a spirited <name>French</name> volume, a writer for <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="De Bow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:De Bow,nomatch:0"><surname>De Bow</surname></persName></hi> sets forth the advantages both to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and ourselves of a redemption of Hayti by its ancient and rightful master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>For ourselves, it is admirably situated to guard the transit across the <name>Isthmus</name>, and in the hands of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, will keep <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <rs>North</rs> in check, and keep open the passage of the <name>Isthmus</name> for the trade of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>For <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the acquisition of Hayti, once the most productive affluent of all the colonial tributaries to her commerce, would be a desideratum which the practical mind of her present <rs type="role2">Emperor</rs> cannot fail to appreciate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>For the island its restoration to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> would be the resurrection of the dead to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Once it was a garden spot; now, every day, becoming a wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>No more complete and conclusive demonstrations of the incapacity of the negro to govern himself can be furnished in all the world or all time than the desolation his improvidence and laziness have brought upon this <name>Eden</name> of the <orgName n="Western world" type="newspaper">Western world</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The staples once furnished by that island have become necessary to the wants of mankind <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, which had no scruples in conquering <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName>, ought to have none in the reclamation of Hayti.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The negroes themselves, who speak French and affect <name>French</name> fashions in all things, would be pleased with the transition from negro despotism to <name>French</name> supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>At present they have become little better than barbarians licentiousness is universal; robbery and murder every-day occurrences; those who have property are not for <num value="1">one</num> moment safe in their possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The hideous Paganism of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> still exerts its influence among multitudes, including many of the highest in position, and although this <rs n="Roman Catholic" type="religion">Roman Catholic</rs> religion has been for a long time the only <num value="1">one</num> recognized in Hayti, the head of that faith refuses to recognize the <rs type="place">Church</rs> in that Island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>On the accession of <hi rend="smallcaps">Soulouque</hi> to the throne, he asked the <rs>Pope</rs> for a Priest, who should be authorized, as the proxy of <name n="his Holiness" type="role"><rs type="role" reg="Pope">his Holiness</rs></name>, to crown him, and also to send him a few Bishops; but he never received a reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The idolatries and iniquities of this abandoned island, which have caused it to be renounced by the ecclesiastical authority which is recognized by itself, can never be removed but by its subjugation by a civilized power, and the compulsion of its people to habits of order and industry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> In fine, with the establishment of Southern independence, we see a bright future, not only for our own country, but for the whole <orgName n="Western world" type="newspaper">Western world</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/><placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> will be rescued from the gulf of anarchy and bloodshed; Hayti be civilized and made happy; the pseudo-philanthropy of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> undergo a final collapse, and even the <rs>North</rs> itself become a wiser and a better people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Nothing is more beneficial than low diet and occasional fasting to people who suffer from an apoplectic tendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The <rs>North</rs> has been corrupted and enervated by its vast accession of commercial wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Its large cities have proved <q>&#x0022;sores upon the body politic,&#x0022;</q> which have infused deadly poison <sic>nto</sic> every vein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The tendency in the <rs>North</rs> has long been to city life, and whilst all its enterprise and energy have been concentrated in those huge, festering hives of demoralized humanity, the comparatively pure and invigorating pursuits of agriculture and of country life have been abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>With final separation from the <rs>South</rs>, the <rs>Northern</rs> cities will dwindle down to respectable dimensions; the sceptre of commerce be transferred to other sections, and the crowded populations be forced to go into the fields and prairies and <q>&#x0022;root pig or die.&#x0022;</q> Thus, even in the <rs>North</rs> itself, a happy effect upon the morality, happiness, and healthfulness of the inhabitants may be confidently expected to follow the establishment of Southern independence. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> Here we have the whole truth in a nutshell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The withdrawal of <num value="12">twelve</num> States whose active co- operation is necessary to carry out the stipulations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, has rendered it impossible to comply with the provisions of that instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It is therefore absolutely void, and of no effect, according to a principle of law common to every code that ever had existence among men. Even in every State had still continued in the Union-even if every State now sent its Representatives and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to Congress &mdash; even if it was still possible to elect a President according to the powers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; still that Constitution would be no longer in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>It has been overthrown by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> himself, and by the <rs>Congress</rs> under whose inspiration he acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>He has destroyed every safe guard which it provided for public liberty.--The Constitution divided the <rs>Government</rs> into <num value="3">three</num> departments &mdash; Legislative, Judicial, and Executive &mdash; and defined their several limits with the greatest particularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The victims of his tyranny are thrown into dungeons without knowing why they were arrested, and there they stay as long as he thinks proper to detain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare martial law within a limited space, for a limited time, and under certain peculiar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>It is for resisting this tyranny that they are called rebels by the tame slaves that live on the other side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>We glory in the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It is always the reproach which rulers cast upon those whom their tyranny drives to resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/> As I informed you by telegraph, our army fell back from <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, between the hours of <num value="12">12</num> and morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Of course the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question that everybody asks is, why it was done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>and to this I can only reply that our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, who have thus far conducted the campaign with entire success, deemed it expedient to do so. When we remember that our army is commanded by <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, the greatest General of the age, and by <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, the most skillful engineer, and by <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Francis,M.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, a man of great ability and thorough training, we can well afford to accept expediency as a reason for any movement that may seem singular and uncalled for, by those who know nothing of the designs of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>In saying this, I do not wish to be understood to say that the people should submit to be led blindly by these men, however skillful and great they may be, without having the privilege of criticising or discussing their acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>On the contrary, I hold that all our civil, as well as military officers, derive their powers from the people, and are, to a certain extent, amenable to them for their deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>The people caused the movement which brought about this war; the people inaugurated the war; they sent their sons, brothers, and kinsmen to fight the battle; they furnish the means and are to derive the future benefits of the struggle, or share the disasters, should any occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>They are, therefore, entitled to know as much of the conduct of the war as prudence will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>When it is necessary to carry out some piece of strategy, or attain some desired end where great secrecy is necessary to prevent furnishing information to the enemy, then the people should submit to the temporary inconvenience of being deprived of facts that will ordinarily be given them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> is over run with spies, who gather their information of our movements and designs from their duties, and then communicate it to the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>It will be seen, then, that it becomes necessary to act with the greatest caution, to withhold for a time all important movements, and to keep the secrets of the campaign from all, except the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>If the people have confidence in their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, they will be perfectly willing to submit to anything that the good of the country requires &mdash; and who is there that does not have confidence in such men as <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00275" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,S.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00276" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Francis,M.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00278" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, <persName n="Dorn,,,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00279" reg="mostcommon:Dorn,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Dorn</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00280" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, and their confreres? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/> Some time ago, while speaking of the occupation of <placeName reg="Munson's hill">Munson's hill</placeName>, I remarked that it, together with the neighboring eminences, could be made, by the erection of field fortifications, a good line for defensive operations, and that counter works could be made opposite those of the enemy that would be valuable to check his advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The whole chain of hills from <placeName reg="Lewinsville">Lewinsville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> would make an admirable base for defensive operations, but would be of little value as a base of offensive movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>They were untenable unless strongly fortified, and this would have necessitated a siege, which might have proved as long and as serious as the siege of <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Scott, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057451">Sebastopol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>The good people grumbled considerably at the idea of giving up any territory once occupied, but at the same time they grumbled at the inactivity or delay of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>They did not seem to consider that to hold a position immediately under the enemy's batteries, and within range of his cannon, it would be necessary to have fortifications, and that the construction of them would cost our men many months' of manual labor and of tedious garrison duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Volunteers are of little value to garrison a fort, and soon get demoralized it kept inactive in camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Hence we find a reason for old <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00281" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s dislike for them as his system of tactics is based upon a fortification of the country over which his army advances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>The system of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00282" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> or of Mariborough is best suited to a volunteer army &mdash; long and rapid marches, frequent battles, and decisive movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Although we have thus far stood entirely on the defensive, the time may come when it will be advisable to act on the offensive, and therefore a field suitable for both is what is needed for successful operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It will be remembered, also, that we are fighting a subjugating army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/><placeName reg="Munson's hill">Munson's hill</placeName> was evacuated, and we fell back to <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName> for a time, where a better field for a fair fight offered itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>This was a direct challenge to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00283" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, which he refused to accept, and for a month every opportunity was offered, with the advantage of position and point of attack decidedly in his favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>For <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> our force kept the <q>&#x0022;grand army&#x0022;</q> within good running distance of their fortifications, never loosing an occasion to give them a showing for a right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/> If <num value="1">one</num> looks at the map of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, he will see that the <rs>Potomac</rs>, from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> to a point tar below this, makes a curve outward, sweeping in its course by the cities of <placeName reg="Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7015724">Georgetown</placeName>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Our forces are scattered from <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> to the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Draw a line through between the <num value="2">two</num> points and it will fall not far from where we now are. <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the right and left flank of our line will be about equidistant from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>It can readily be seen that, were there no other advantages, the <sic>obcupation</sic> of this line brings our force in a position to be easily concentrated at either of the <num value="3">three</num> places mentioned, should it become necessary to do so. There are also some admirable natural positions here whereon, to man&#x0153;uvre troops, and positions where both armies could have an opportunity of crossing lances in an open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> having once occupied the country, have made most elaborate surveys of the ground, and undoubtedly have the best possible topographical maps and drawings of every hill, wood, and valley, as well as the course and condition of every road and bye-way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>If, then, they offer battle here, it will be with as good knowledge of the country as we have ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>Whether <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00284" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> will accept this as the battle ground, or will choose some other, makes no difference; there is none, probably, that would offer his <orgName n="Army of Occupation" type="army">army of occupation</orgName> better opportunities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/> These of course are mere speculations in regard to a movement, the success of which can only be determined in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>For the present we must put what construction on it we please and await patiently the result, content to know that our men are ready to meet the enemy anyhow, anywhere and on any terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have confidence in their men; the men have confidence in their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>Whenever or wherever it comes, the next battle will be a decisive <num value="1">one</num>, and will tell powerfully upon this country and this nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> an order was issued to the troops to prepare to march at a moment's notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Some supposed that the great battle was beginning, and made all preparations for a fight and for a serious time of it. By <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> everything was ready, the tents were struck, the baggage trains started, and the whole army gotten in movable condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>Up to this time the real object of the change had not been known, but it became generally understood that it was not to be an immediate advance, and that, for the present, <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00285" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName> was to be abandoned to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>This, of course, caused great consternation among the citizens of the town, who flew hither and thither through the village half frantic with dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/><rs n="carpet bag" type="product">Carpet bags</rs> and trunks were hastily and closely packed; rooms and houses were stripped of their valuables; horses and cattle were driven from the farm-yards, and every vehicle that rolled on wheels was pressed into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>About <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> the excitement was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>For once the quiet old town, in whose streets the grass has grown since the time <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Fairfax</foreName></persName> trod over them, was turned upside down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>The trees seemed to dance about in the wildest manner, and to chatter up to the venerable brick piles, which kept time to the music of some imaginary <q>&#x0022;Piper of Niecee.&#x0022;</q> Regiment after regiment filed through the streets; long trains of transport wagons, droves of toiling and lowing beeves, cavalcades of horses, batteries of artillery companies and squads, of men and lines of stragglers, singing snatches of familiar songs, passed by in orderly march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Between the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> and the hotel, and far down the road beyond the town, beyond our lines, up and down, a wild scene presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>On every side huge bonfires were blazing, sending up masses of smoke which blackened the atmosphere, and spreading out like a funeral pall, half obscured the stars, which shone with unusual brilliancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Heavy, black clouds gathered themselves overhead as if to prepare for an orderly retreat; and the gibbous moon, like the goddess <rs>Juno</rs> in her silver chariot, came out to chase the dark battalions from the sky. The country for miles around was blazing with lights, and far away on the distant hillsides, beyond the wood, across the valley, glimmered the campfires, through the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>In the observatory, built upon the roof of the hotel, the signal men were telegraphing to the outpost, and the red glare of the torches waving to and fro, and falling upon their moving forms and faces, and upon the busy masses below, gave all the appearance of demons engaged in some sardonic orgies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The hillside upon which the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">First Virginia</orgName> was encamped was brilliantly illuminated by fires kindled and fed by baggage, provisions, old tents, and other matter that could not be transported.--I recollect to have seen &mdash; in the <rs>Belvidere</rs> at Wiemar, I think &mdash; a picture of the occupation of a Polish town by the <name>Austrian</name> troops.--The streets were full of soldiers and terrified citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>Camp-fires were kindled in every direction, and through it all ran a vein of busy, excited life, that pleased me well.-- <q>&#x0022;Ah!&#x0022;</q> thought I, <q>&#x0022;how much I should like to be a witness of such a scene.&#x0022;</q> After years of wandering from that gallery which so delighted my boyhood, here, far across the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, was a picture as similar as <num value="1">one</num> could wish. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/> At <num value="12">twelve</num> the army was put in motion, and in perfect silence, without the beat of a drum or the note of a bugle, the men marched out their forsaken encampments, and took the </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>The route was completely filled, and the halting of a single wagon caused the stoppage of men and the train for miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The <rs>Generals</rs> superintended the march in person, and were riding here and there seemingly unconscious of danger or fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Whole families were seen walking by the wayside, carrying such articles as they could hastily gather in their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Old women, maidens, and little children tramped through the weary night to a home of safety beyond the reach of a vandal foe. The individual cases of suffering were too numerous to be particularized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>With feelings of intense sorrow and pain I rode by these unfortunate families, driven from their happy homes to seek shelter behind the line of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Leaning on the arm of an aged man the form of a sick girl, whose patient, pensive face comes to me more often than it ought, passed in the singular cortege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>The sight was <num value="1">one</num> that brought tears into eyes long unused to weeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/> The way in which her doings came to be brought to light is <num value="1">one</num> of the most singular testures in the whole affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>While she was playing the spy upon supposed abolition agents, she was herself being watched and spied on suspicion of being an abolition agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>At length the officer thought her actions were suspicious enough to war rant her arrest, particularly as he had not been able to catch her in an overt act of treason, and believed she was meditating it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/> The <rs>Mayor</rs> told her that he did not feel himself authorized to give her a commission <unclear> </unclear> detective, but that he would thoroughly investigate the information she had given him, and if it proved reliable, she might have the satisfaction of having performed a service to her country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>He set her at liberty on her own recognizince, to appear when called for, and in the meantime issued warrants for the arrest of <persName n="Peck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00343" reg="mostcommon:Peck,nomatch:0"><surname>Peck</surname></persName> and <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,Wm,H.,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/> <q>&#x0022;My little sunbeam,&#x0022;</q> the father fondly called her, while the mother would say, in her low, sweet tones, <q>&#x0022;our angel.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/> <num value="1">One</num> night the young housekeeper waited until it was pitch bark for her father to come home to his frugal supper, and then, with fearful forebodings at her heart, undressed the little boys and put them to bed, and tied on her hood and cloak to go for him. A crowd met her at the very threshold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>With a wild cry, she rushed toward the inanimate form they carried upon a board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>It was her father, brought home to them with a broken leg. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/> A week had passed since this misfortune.--By the sale of their few pieces of furniture, the wolf had been kept from the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>But now nothing remained save the coarse bed on which the distressed ones slept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>No coal for the little grate; no tea for the feverish lips; no crusts for the famished children!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>What should be done? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/> It was a question little <persName n="Marie,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00459" reg="mostcommon:Marie,nomatch:0"><surname>Marie</surname></persName> asked herself again and again as they lay there watching the few pale sunbeams that struggled through the window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>And she asked it oftener after she had risen and dressed herself and brothers, and smoothed the <num value="2">two</num> beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Bread they must have that day. They were all faint even now, and the boys clamoring for their breakfast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/> Suddenly a bright thought came to the little daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>She remembered having seen in the coffee houses young girls, no taller than she, waiting upon the customers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>Perhaps they would try her. <q>&#x0022;If they only would,&#x0022;</q> she <sic>murmered</sic> softly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/><q>&#x0022;I am handy, quick, and patient, and I would try so hard to oblige.&#x0022;</q> I am pretty, too, she might truly have added, had there been a spark of vanity in her heart; for she was a sweet child, with a brow like a sunny snowdrift, and eyes like the spring violets that nestle in the woodlands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/><q>&#x0022;I will try at least, and see what I can do;&#x0022;</q> and after watching a moment the weary sleep of her parents, she whispered to the little boys that she was going out to get some bread for them, and hurried away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/> She did go to the baker's, but her pitiful story failed to touch his hard heart, and there were tears on her cold cheek as she turned away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Even if she secured a place, she could hope for no wages till <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and there were <num value="4">four</num> weary days between this and that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>Bread would be too late if she waited till then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>What should she do &mdash; beg?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>She asked herself the question with a quivering lip.--Never before had their poverty driven them to that straight, and it was hard, even now, with the picture of that wretched home fresh in her vision, to plead for charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>But she did it. Again and again she said to the passers-by <q>&#x0022;Please, sir, please, <unclear>ma am,</unclear> give me a penny to buy bread for my sick parents.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/> But the gentlemen had their overcoats buttoned to their chins, and the ladies were enveloped in furs, and it was too much like trouble to find their <rs n="pocket books" type="product">pocket-books</rs> or purses just to supply a beggar's wants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/> <q>&#x0022;Go to the soup-house,&#x0022;</q> said <num value="1">one</num>, at last, more churlish than the rest.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/> It was a new idea to her, and as fast as feet could carry her she went, and entering in breathless haste told her story to the attendant matron. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/> <q>&#x0022;I will report the case to the committee,&#x0022;</q> said the woman quietly, making a memorandum of the name and number of the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/><q>&#x0022;Come in to-morrow morning, and I will do what I can for you.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/> To-morrow!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>She would be too weak to walk so far by that time, and what would become of the rest? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/> With a heavy heart, she went home, having no courage to present herself as a waiter to any of the coffee houses she passed on her way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/> <q>&#x0022;Did you get some?&#x0022;</q> cried the boys, gathering about her, and pulling off her cloak to see if it were hidden in her cloak or under her arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/> <q>&#x0022;Did you get some?&#x0022;</q> said <num value="2">two</num> faint voices from the bed in the corner, and the coverlet was thrown off, and <num value="2">two</num> pairs of thin, white hands put forth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/> <q>&#x0022;No, no,&#x0022;</q> she answered plaintively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/><q>&#x0022;But I will try again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Keep up good hope.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/> <q>&#x0022;There will be plenty out of the oven now. Yes, plenty,&#x0022;</q> she said to herself, as she buttoned her cloak on the threshold; <q>&#x0022;plenty, and I'll have some, too. They shall not starve.--Men and women forsake me; <name n="God" type="God">God</name> doesn't hear me any longer!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>There is nothing left for me to do but <hi rend="italics">steel.</hi>&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/> Her face paled as she spoke it, and for a few moments there was a wild wrestle in her heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Then she went on quietly, pausing an instant before each baker's door, and looking anxiously within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>By and by she found <num value="1">one</num> that seemed empty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/> A whole pile of steaming loaves lay upon the counter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/> She rushed in and seized <num value="1">one</num>, and hiding it under her cloak, fled madly up the street. --But the baker had seen her from the little sitting-room door, and was after her, crying lustily, <q>&#x0022;Stop thief, stop thief!&#x0022;</q> A crowd followed her and the poor child was soon run down. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/> <q>&#x0022;A clear case,&#x0022;</q> said the police officer, who took her in hand--<q> &#x0022;property found on her.--She must go to the court-room.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/> In vain she pleaded with them, and told her story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/><q>&#x0022;They must do their duty, she might have begged; she might have gone to the soup house; there was no excuse for stealing, at any rate.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/> No excuse, and her mother was dying for food! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/> An important trial was just closing, and all the avenues to the court-house were thronged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/> <q>&#x0022;They'll be through soon,&#x0022;</q> said the officer to the baker; <q>&#x0022;we'll wait here a few moments No danger of her getting away while my grip is on her,&#x0022;</q> and he rightened his grip on the shrinking arm, till the flesh quivered with pain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/> <q>&#x0022;Take me home <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>,&#x0022;</q> she said sadly; <q>&#x0022;they will worry about me so. My poor mother will die if she thinks I'm lost&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/> <q>&#x0022;They'll soon find out where you are,&#x0022;</q> said he, gruffly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/> <q>&#x0022;Oh, dear!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>oh, dear!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>What will become of them?&#x0022;</q> and she sobbed aloud. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/> A little girl about her age was passing by &mdash; a rich man's child &mdash; you would know it by!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>the embroidered dress and cloak, the <rs n="rich velvet" type="product">rich velvet</rs> hood, and the costly fur tippet and muff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>But there was no false pride hidden under the expensive raiment; a warm heart was beating there, and its sympathies went out far towards the poor little prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>For a moment she paused, as if irresolute upon her plan of action; then laying her mittened hand gently on the officer's, she said politely: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/> <q>&#x0022;May I speak with her?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/> <q>&#x0022;O, yes; she's not committed yet.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/> Putting her soft rosy cheek close to the purple cold <unclear>o e,</unclear> she whispered very earnestly.--<persName n="Maria,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00460" reg="mostcommon:Maria,nomatch:0"><surname>Maria</surname></persName> told her a touching story; and begged she would, by the love she bore her mother, to find out her humble home, and comfort the distressed ones. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/> <q>&#x0022;I will, I will,&#x0022;</q> the stranger replied earnestly; <q>&#x0022;and don't you cry any more; my father knews the judge, and he'll get you away to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>Good-bye &mdash; keep up a good heart;&#x0022;</q> and off she ran. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/> She knew her mother to be <num value="1">one</num> of the most charitable of women, and hastened home to tell her the story of Maric; but unfortunately, she had just gone to ride, and would not be back till near dinner time. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/> <q>&#x0022;What can I do?&#x0022;</q> she cried, and wrung her hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/> <q>&#x0022;They want coal, and bread, and tea, and so many things, and I have only <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> in my pocket.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/> She sat down on the marble steps and pondered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>All at once her eyes brightened, and a beautiful color flushed her face. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/> <q>&#x0022;I'll do it,&#x0022;</q> she said resolutely; <q>&#x0022;mamma will forgive me, when she knows all. Without fire, without food, nearly naked, quite starved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>O, she will be so glad I thought so far;&#x0022;</q> and she bounded down the street and rushed around the corner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/> Pushing open the plate-glass door of the most fashionable hair-dresser of the city, she went quietly up to the attendant, and asked to see Monsieur B. He ushered her into the inner room, saying he would call him. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/> For a moment her lips quivered; then she spoke up quickly: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>The hair-dresser was astonished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>What could the child mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>To cut off those curls, long, silken, and gold colored, the pale gold of a stray sunbeam, it would have been sacrilege almost for a mother to have done it; to sell them, was surely a crime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/> <q>&#x0022;Does she, your mother, does she know you come here?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/> <q>&#x0022;And how is it, my dear?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>Make a friend of me, and tell me how it comes you ask me to buy your hair;&#x0022;</q> and he stroked the glossy curls as tenderly as a father might. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/> She hesitated, and then opened her heart to him. There was a mist on his eyes when she finished her plaintive story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>He walked the floor a moment as if irresolute, then stopping before her, he took out his pocket-book, and handed her <num value="2">two</num> half eagles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>She put them in her purse, and quietly took off her hood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/> <q>&#x0022;Not now, my little angel!&#x0022;</q> he said, huskily; <q>&#x0022;not now, I am too busy, to-morrow will do as well; or stay; I will come in this evening.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>The little boys helped her to build a fire in the cold stove, and when it blazed merrily, she put on the kettles, and soon had a refreshing cup of tea for each invalid, and a platter of smoking potatoes for the children. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/> He did so, and there was not a dry eye in the audience when he ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>Even the baker hung his head, and seemed to muse.--Before the breathless silence had been broken, he looked up and said to the judge, <q>&#x0022;I withdraw my complaint; let her go with me and take all she wants.&#x0022;</q> </p>
