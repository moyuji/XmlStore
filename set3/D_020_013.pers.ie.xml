<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Another fight and success so far with the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Before daybreak this morning (<dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>,) the troops at this camp were aroused by the firing of the <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName>, and in a short time our men were in line and ready for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>About light another volley was fired, apparently about a mile from our camp and the excitement was increased by the rapid movement of the <orgName type="mil" key="GARegiment">Georgia Regiment</orgName> and the cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Finally orders came for us to take proper positions, that the enemy was advancing upon us, and that the <orgName type="mil" key="GARegiment">Georgia Regiment</orgName> had fired upon them and held them in check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This regiment kept up a fire upon them until about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time>, killing <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> of the enemy, and receiving in turn only <num value="1">one</num> men wounded, slightly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> At <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time>, the <name>Georgians</name> were marched off and the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 23">23D Regiment</orgName> took its place, on the brow of a hill to a very short distance of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The <num value="23" type="ordinal">23D</num> remained on the ground until dark, when they were relieved by the <num value="27">27</num> <unclear></unclear> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <num value="23" type="ordinal">23d</num> under the command of its brave and able commander, <persName n="Taliaferro,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,William,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName>, behaved with coolness and courage worthy of veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The Sharpshooters, <persName n="Tompkins,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Tompkins,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Tompkins</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, were selected as the advance corps, and took up their position within <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of the enemy, and acting as skirmishers, took to the woods and done their duty faithfully and well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In fact, they being the only company armed with this, they had to bear the brunt of the fighting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> This company, as soon as they were stationed, commenced a rapid fire on the enemy, which was as promptly returned; but fortunately with little execution to us. The fire was kept up until <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>, at which time we were relieved I cannot particularize any <num value="1">one</num> who performed the most service, where all done so well, not only in this corps, but in the whole regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The enemy's loss is estimated at <measure n="25" type="killed">25 killed</measure>. How many wounded could not be ascertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The firing is still carried on by the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 27">27th Regiment</orgName>, our men now being in the trenches, sleeping on their arms, expecting to go at it again to-morrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The enemy commenced their work with yells and cheers, swearing and using all kinds of vulgar language, which our troops replied to by well aimed bullets and a determination to <unclear></unclear> rather than yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I have not time to write any more to-night, but will give you particulars when the battle is ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> There has been nothing of special interest for the past day or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Rumors continue to rather us of a speedy bombardment of our city, but are regarded of little consequence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> We learn from a lady who conversed with <persName n="Segar,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Segar,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Segar</surname></persName>, a former resident near <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, that the <rs>Lincoln</rs> scoundrels took from her <num value="2">two</num> homes and a carriage, and kept them for some weeks, when for some reason they were indirect to return then <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> S did not have them long in her possession before they were again stolen; and when last seen, <persName n="Butler,Mrs.,Picayune,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Butler,Picayune,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Picayune</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> was seen taking a pleasant ride between <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:1"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We knew <persName n="Picayune,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Picayune,nomatch:0"><surname>Picayune</surname></persName> was proverbial for stealing; but we must say this excels former traits in his character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> On yesterday a salute was fired here in honor of the death of the late distinguished Governor of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He was held in high esteem by his many friends in this city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> And scarcely do we make this announcement, when we are called upon to receive the remains of <num value="1">one</num> of our most respected citizens, <persName n="Griffith,Mister,W.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="default:Griffith,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Griffith</surname></persName>, who died at the <rs type="place">Springs</rs>, whither, like <persName n="Ellis,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Ellis,Thomas,H.,,:2"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName>, he had gone to repair his health. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>There have been enemies in our midst who have obtained permission to go down the river under the plea of fishing, but who have been engaged in secret service for the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We have indisputable proof of this fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Another attack was made on <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName> this week, from the <name>Rip</name>-Raps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> or <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <num value="17">seventeen</num> shot were fired from this point, but doing no damage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It is thought that a tall pine tree in the neighborhood of <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries has been the means of directing the fire of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This pins is considerably taller than the rest, and several of our men have complained to this effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It should be removed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The young man Rayman, who deserted a short time ago from <orgName n="company"><persName n="Grimes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Grimes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Grimes</surname></persName>' company</orgName>, of <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName>, is said to have carried with him in his flight a full description of <placeName reg="Craney Island Pig Point">Craney Island Pig Point</placeName> and <placeName reg="Boush's Bluff Batteries">Boush's Bluff Batteries</placeName>, with number of forces, &#x0026;c. This is probable, from the fact that he is quite a smart fellow, and capable of giving correctly any information of that kind to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> We are in possession of facts which warrant us in believing that we have yet amongst us a great many scoundrels who sympathize with the <rs>North</rs>, and who would gladly aid in our subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Such, we again say, should be looked after. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Within the past day or <num value="2">two</num> a large fleet has arrived near the <name>Fortress</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> Our community was somewhat astir yesterday, about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>, caused by a most desperate fight, quite a number being engaged, in which sabres and pistols were freely used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The affair grew out of a dispute about the present <q>&#x0022;crisis,&#x0022;</q> in which <num value="2">two</num> men named Keight and <persName n="Reynolds,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,nomatch:0"><surname>Reynolds</surname></persName> received severe injuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The latter was wounded in the shoulder by a pistol ball, which, striking the bone, it is thought lodged in his lungs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Surgical aid was quickly called, but we learn their situation is considered dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They are residents of our city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/> &#x0022;We have deemed it proper to call your attention to the fact that since the militia have been called out there are many able-bodied young men who profess to have attached themselves to volunteer companies, have not enrolled their names, and they spend their time in visiting those companies for a few days and then return to their homes for as many weeks, intending thereby to avoid enrollment in the militia and all duties imposed upon the regular volunteers, such as drilling, standing guard, &#x0026;c. The captains of the volunteer companies, not considering them regular members, take little heed of them, while their men extend the hospitalities of the camp in the hope of inducing them to become regular members by enrolling their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>This sort of dissimulation and low cunning to avoid military duty altogether should be exposed, and the officers in command put on the alert so that such trickery may be stopped, and such individuals brought down to peremptory service in <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> or the other. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>These forces, where such characters exist, can make no surprise march, and when the enemy approaches they become conductors, leading him through the difficult and dangerous passes, secret paths and byways, so as to entrap or surprise our citizens and soldiers, as was the case in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, and more recently in the town of <placeName reg="Romney, Hampshire, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119828">Romney</placeName>, <placeName reg="Hampshire, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002265">Hampshire county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/> I cannot close without giving you a rich piece of scandal in shopkeeping life that has been the town's amusement for same days.--Have you ever heard of a suit to recover the value of <num value="2">two</num> ringlets?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>If you have not you are behind us. The case is this: The pretty daughter of a poor merchant of this place honestly and finally aided her family with her earnings as a dress cutter and fitter, and in the pursuit of her occupation intently had to make small purchases in a shop situated in the old part of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>The shop in question rejoiced in the presence of a young and dishing clerk whose parents were in easy circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/> The clerk, guided by sentiments I will not undertake to analyze, had often begged our pretty dressmaker to give him <num value="1">one</num> of her beautiful ringlets but <unclear></unclear> Marguerita refused, as any clever <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> might very rightly do.
