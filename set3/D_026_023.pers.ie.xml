<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>And this scheme is to be carried into operation for the special benefit of the negro, and to the prejudice of the white owner of the soil, for it must not be forgotten that the negro is the chief object of the solicitude and affection of the <rs>Washington</rs> despotism. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> But we have already dwelt too long on this last decide of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Autocrat, and must hasten to a conclusion, with the intention, however, of referring to it again at some future time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> The amnesty which is offered to the <rs>Confederates</rs> under a certain rank, in official and military life, is too absurd to be worthy of even a passing notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>To offer a pardon to men who have shown their ability to maintain their position, who are thoroughly united, who are urged by every consideration to persevere in the determination with which they set out, is preposterous in the highest degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The Southern people are fighting in a just cause, as they are fighting against usurpation, and confiscation, and for freedom and State rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They are fighting to preserve their land against the fate of <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Polska" key="tgn,7006366">Poland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>They are fighting against a power that has trampled every principle of law and constitutional authority under foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>They are fighting for their homes, for their dearest rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>But so long as they are united and actuated by the spirit which they have thus far exhibited, they cannot be subjugated, and we trust they never will be. Whatever doubts might be entertained in regard to the justice of their cause, there can be none now. Others may hesitate to say this; but there is no man possessing a sense of justice, and who is not impelled to silence by the dread of a penalty which has fallen upon many for exercising the right of free speech, who will not acknowledge that the cause of the <rs>South</rs> is to-day the cause of Liberty against Despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The fear takes the opposite direction now. There is a <unclear>ant;</unclear> and not a superfluity, of hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>But the fact is hot owing wholly or mainly, to the inability of the laborers to live.-- Wages are now nearly double what they were <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago, while the price of provisions is moderate, and the quantity of food is much varied and improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> --Since the year <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>, I have devoted much thought and labor to the invention of a machine for &#x00E6;rial locomotion by man.--The proper form and external appendages of the body were early and readily devised; but its successful operation has been delayed by the want of a suitable power to give it practical effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>That difficulty has been overcome, however, by my recent invention of an air engine, which is admirably adapted to, and deemed amply sufficient for, this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>For obvious reasons, it would be improper to publish the plan by which the great and long-sought <hi rend="italics">desideratum of </hi>&#x00E6;rial locomotion may be attained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> Early in the year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> I sent a memorial to the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">Provisional Congress</orgName>, then in session at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, asking assistance in behalf of my invention, with the view of employing it against our enemies in the existing war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>At a later period still another memorial was handed to a member of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName> Congress, but which never was presented to that body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>And, to complete this sketch of such efforts on my part to obtain legislative aid, in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> last I memorialized the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName>, at that time convened in extra session in this city; but, I regret to say, that all of these applications failed to elicit any attention to the great importance of this invention to our country at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>And finally, at the suggestion of <persName n="Gens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="mostcommon:Gens,nomatch:0"><surname>Gens</surname></persName> R E <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and G T <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, I referred the subject of my invention to the <rs type="place">Engineer Bureau</rs> of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, where it remained many weeks without investigation, and was withdrawn a few days since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>And feeling a profound personal interest in the success of our cause and the future welfare of our country, I now appeal to the citizens and soldiers of the country at large for aid in raising the means to construct and put in operation the <hi rend="italics">Artisavis</hi> (<persName n="Bird,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="mostcommon:Bird,nomatch:0"><surname>Bird</surname></persName> of Art.) By the use of a considerable number of these machines all of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies now upon our soil and their blockading fleets may be speedily driven off or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>In the present condition of our currency it will take a large sum to construct the requisite number of Birds of Art for this object; but if this appeal should be responded to generally, none need contribute more than <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num> dollar</hi>--a sum that every <num value="1">one</num> may spare without inconvenience &mdash; in order to rid our country of the perils and privations of this fiendish war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> A short extract from my memorial to the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName> will serve to show how this desirable object may be accomplished: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> &#x0022;Now, let it be supposed that this number (<num value="1000">1,000</num>) of these Birds of Art were stationed at a point <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles distant</measure> from a hostile military camp, fortification, or fleet of war vessels; that each <hi rend="italics">Artisavis</hi> was supplied with a <measure n="50l." type="pounds"><num value="50">fifty</num> pound</measure> explosive shell, and being started singly, or <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> abreast, going out and dropping those destructive missiles from a point of elevation beyond the reach of the enemy's guns, then returning to the place of departure and reloading, and thus continuing the movement at the rate of <measure n="100miles" type="distance">100 miles</measure> per hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It will be seen that within the period of <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure>, <hi rend="italics"><num value="150000">one hundred and fifty thousand</num> death dealing bombs,</hi> could be thus thrown down upon the foe, a force that no defensive art on land, however solid, could withstand even for a single day; while exposed armies and ships would be almost instantly destroyed, without the least chance of escape.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Legislature of Virginia"></bibl></cit>
