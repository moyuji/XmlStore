<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> If we regret the course of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> at this period, so critical in the affairs of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> &mdash; when our cause is so bright, and there and so many reasons for encouraging us all to a united and grand effort &mdash; when we have as there is cause to believe, reached a turning point, that opens to us the prospect of an early and successful formication of our struggle &mdash; a propitious day, when the sky is growing brighter for us, and darker and gloomier for our hated foes &mdash; at such a time, we confess something like astonishment at the course of <persName n="Stephens,Vice-President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Vice-President">Vice-President</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>He is reported to have made a speech at <placeName key="tgn,2023617" n="1.000 65" reg="milledgeville, baldwin, georgia">Milledgeville</placeName>, to the members of the <orgName n="Georgia Legislature" type="legislature">Georgia Legislature</orgName>, which, if correctly represented, must have been chiefly a complaint entered against the <rs>Government</rs> for all its leading measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>We can hardly believe that he permitted himself to go as for as he is reported to have gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>He is said to have disapproved not only the act suspending the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> in certain cases, but the currency, and military bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>We had not expected this from a man of <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>'s calm disposition, and reputed good sense and sound discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>With regard to the suspension of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> we conjecture that a case will hardly arise in which it will be resorted to by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It confers, indeed, a dangerous power on the <rs>President</rs>, but Congress knew the man, and had no fear of its abuse for the very limited period during which it was conferred, and deeming it important for the public welfares did confer it upon him. Its necessity may have been exaggerated; but the country cannot believe it will be abused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Every act of the <rs>President</rs> in reference to offenders against the laws has betrayed a disposition of forbearance so strong that the press and the people have complained that the public interest has suffered by his excessive clemency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Deserters were pardoned until remonstrance came from the country and the army with great energy and unanimity; nor was <num value="1">one</num> shot until it was deemed absolutely indispensable for the preservation of discipline in the army that the crime should be punished rigidly, just as it is in all armies and in all countries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> But granting that a strong sentiment of State rights and devotion to the principles of personal liberty may induce some citizens and some States to complain of the suspension of that writ, which tradition has rendered so sacred in the public mind, it would be more creditable to their motives and their patriotism if they were satisfied to express frankly and fearlessly this sentiment and there rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>To involve it in a mass of complaints against the general expediency of the measures of the <rs>Government</rs> for the preservation of the public credit and for the maintenance of the army, is prejudicial to their attitude in defence of what they claim to be vital principles of constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>We could not have supposed that <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> would have allowed his own position to sustain a prejudice of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Upon him, in case of the death or disability of the <rs>President</rs>, would devolve the solemn responsibility of <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.--Were he to enter upon his duties with a repudiation of all the grave measures for the defence of the country, his power and the efficiency of his Administration would very naturally encounter consequential difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Those measures &mdash; the financial and the military &mdash; are the very best under the circumstances the <rs>Congress</rs> could have matured, (with some partial defects, which a little time of practical test will develop, and that may then be amended.) They are about going into successful operation, giving every encouragement of the best results in strengthening the army and elevating the public credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It is most inopportune that at such a time &mdash; with the enemy at the door &mdash; that any community &mdash; nay, any individual, and of all men the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice President</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> &mdash; should utter a word to their prejudice, or to discourage the loyal people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> in their hearty acquiescence in those measures, and their ready submission to all the heavy burthens imposed upon them &mdash; burthens that must be borne or we must submit to that horrid <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> despotism which will not only deprive us of everything we have, but degrade us to the ignominious condition of serfs. </p>
