<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> In the long and bloody war in which your country is engaged, you have achieved many noble triumphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>You have won glorious victories ever vastly more numerous hosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>You have cheerfully borne privations and toll to which you were unused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>You have readily submitted to restrainers upon your individual will, that the citizen might better perform his duty to the <rs>State</rs> as a soldier.--To all these you have lately added another triumph, the noblest of human conquests &mdash; a victory over yourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> As the time drew near when you who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered the service might well have been expected to claim relief from your arduous labors and restoration to the endearments of home, you have heeded only the call of your suffering country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Again you come to tender your service for the public defence &mdash; a free offering which only such patriotism as yours could make &mdash; a triumph worthy of you and of the cause to which you are devoted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> I would in vain attempt adequately to express the emotions with which I received the testimonials of confidence and regard which you have recently addressed to me. To some of those <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> received, separate acknowledgments were returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>But it is now apparent that a like generous enthusiasm pervades the whole army, and that the only exception to such magnanimous tender will be of these who, having originally entered for the war, cannot display, anew their zeal in the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It is, therefore, deemed appropriate, and it is hoped, will be equally acceptable, to make a general acknowledgment, instead of successive special responses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Would that it were possible to render my thanks to you in person, and in the name of our common country, as well as in my own, while pressing the hand of each war-worn veteran, to recognize his title to our love, gratitude and admiration. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> Soldiers! By your will (for you and the people are but <num value="1">one</num>) I have been placed in a position which debars me from sharing your dangers, your sufferings, and your privations in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>With pride and affection my heart has accompanied you in every march; with aclicirude it has sought to minister to your every want; with exultation it has marked your every heroic achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Yet, never in the toilsome march, nor in the weary watch, nor in the desperate assault, have you rendered a service so decisive in results as in this last display of the highest qualities of devotion and self sacrifice which can adorn the character of the warrior- patriot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> Already the pulse of the whole people beats in unison with yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Already they <sic>comare</sic> your spontaneous and unanimous offer of your lives, for the defence of your country, with the halting and reluctant service of the mercenaries who are purchased by the enemy at the price of higher bounties than have hitherto been known in war. Animated by this contrast, they exhibit cheerful confidence and more resolute bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Even the murmurs of the weak and timid, who shrink from the trials which make stronger and firmer your noble natures, are shamed into silence by the spectacle which you present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Your brave baulecry, will ring loud and clear through the land of the enemy, as well as our own; will silence the vainglorious boastings of their corrupt partisans and their pensioned press; and will do justice to the calumny by which they seek to persuade a deluded people that you are ready to purchase dishonorable safety by degrading submission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> Soldiers! The coming spring campaign will open under auspices well calculated to sustain your hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Your resolution needed nothing to fortify it. With ranks replenished under the influence of your example, and by the aid of your representatives, who give earnest of their purpose to add, by legislation, largely to your strength, you may welcome the invader with a confidence justified by the memory of past victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>On the other hand, debt, taxation, repartition of heavy drafts, dissuasions, occasioned by the strife for power, by the pursuit of the spoils of office, by the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, for the plunder of the public treasury; and above all, the consciousness of a bad cause, must tell with fearful force upon the over strained energies of the enemy.
