<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> It was reported the other day that <persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName> had been made a <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>We know not whether the report be true or not; but we are under the impression that there is no man in the army whose services entitle him to such promotion more than he.--<persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName> has, in the opinion even of officers regularly educated at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, manifested, throughout this whole struggle, whenever his services have been brought into requisition, a genius for war which only wants a wider field for its exercise to give its possessor a just claim to the title of a great captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He is evidently <num value="1">one</num> of those &#x0022;heaven-born generals&#x0022; that sometimes appear in the course of a long war, and when they do, instantly throw all competitors in the shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>He is a general by instinct, or, if you will, by intuition, as all great generals have always been. &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Poeta naxitur, nonfit,</hi>&#x0022;. (a poet must be born a poet and cannot be made <num value="1">one</num>) is the axiom of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It is true of the poet, and we are disposed to think it true, to a certain extent, of every other talent.--The man of genius, whose talent is exercised in any particular walk, will, in that walk, leave all competition behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Who could become a Henry by pouring over <placeName reg="Blackstone, Nottoway, Virginia" key="tgn,2110692">Blackstone</placeName> and <persName n="Coke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Coke,nomatch:0"><surname>Coke</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Who could become a Newton by studying his eyes out over volumes of mathematics and natural philosophy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It is the great original genius that lays the corner-stone of every art and every science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Men of routine can only learn by rote what genius has dedicated to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Military schools will prescribe the study of <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>'s campaign in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Sallie,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s campaign in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>But no military school can create a Jackson or a Lee. Nature must do that, and it is very seldom that nature condescends to do any such thing.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> Boldness of design, rapidity of execution, perfect secrecy, cautious planning, daring execution &mdash; these are the characteristics of his generalship, as developed in the progress of the war. He is like lightning in the eyes of enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>They never know when to expect him or where to look for him. Space is no protection against his enterprises, and forts and breastworks no safeguards against his daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>He appears to annihilate the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and to laugh at the strength of the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>His sagacity is equal to his boldness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>He anticipates all plans laid to entrap him, and turns to grief all attempts to overwhelm him by numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>We saw in a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> paper, but yesterday, that <persName n="Rousseau,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:Rousseau,nomatch:0"><surname>Rousseau</surname></persName> was hunting for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>He would gladly take him to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> land, but <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName> won't go.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>He will find it very hard to shake him off, and perhaps by this time he wishes he had let him alone. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> Soldiers are proverbially quick in discovering the merits of a commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>What he orders to be done, is done at once, and without a question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>They conclude, whatever it may be, that it is right for no other reason than that he orders it. There certainly are men born to command &mdash; men upon whom nature has fixed the seal of authority so decidedly that it cannot be mistaken.
