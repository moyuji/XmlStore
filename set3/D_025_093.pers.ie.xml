<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> --The extreme brightness of the atmosphere on Saturday rendered it a day peculiarly fit for the generation of rumors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>People felt happy under the influence of the fine weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Every man felt &#x0022;his bosom's lord sit lightly on his throne,&#x0022; and &#x0022;all day long an unaccustomed spirit&#x0022; lifted him from the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>It was not wonderful, therefore, that all the rumors were of a rosy hue. The &#x0022;reliable gentleman&#x0022; was in town early, and began his tour as soon as he arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation we had of his presence was from an enthusiastic friend, a professional gentleman of much eminence, who met us with sparkling eyes and countenance radiant with joy, seized us by both hands, and, with a voice quivering with excitement, exclaimed, &#x0022;Glorious news!&#x0022; He was able to get out no more, and it was some time before he could make us understand that he had seen &mdash; not the elephant, but &mdash; the &#x0022;reliable gentleman,&#x0022; and had learned from him that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had <measure n="18000" type="captured">captured 18,000</measure> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>We thought this a pretty big haul, but our friend was so earnest that we did not venture to dispute the correctness of his information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>We passed on, therefore, to hear the same tale repeated in a <num value="100">hundred</num> different shapes. &#x0022;Where did the intelligence come from?&#x0022; &#x0022;From the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName>.&#x0022; &#x0022;Did you hear it there?&#x0022; &#x0022;No!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>but I saw a man just from there, who says <persName n="Withers,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00278" reg="mostcommon:Withers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Withers</surname></persName> told him so.&#x0022; Full of hope we repair to the office, and meet Col.

We continue our investigations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Soon meet another friend with the same intelligence. &#x0022;How did you get it?&#x0022; &#x0022;It came from the <rs>President</rs>'s private <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>There can be no doubt of it. It must be so.&#x0022; We are now certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>We meet a man to whom we communicate the glad tidings and the source whence they came. &#x0022;Why, I have just seen the <rs type="role" reg="Private-Secretary">private Secretary</rs>, and he said nothing about all this.&#x0022; Here is a damper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Surely if such a communication had been made to the <rs type="role" reg="Private-Secretary">private Secretary</rs> he would have said something about it. We resolve, however, not to despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We meet a gentleman to whom we communicate what we have heard. &#x0022;Why, it must be true; for I was at the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> office just now when a gentleman came in and said a member of the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> had risen in his place and read a dispatch from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00279" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to the <rs>President</rs> to that effect.&#x0022; Here we were again staggered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We know that dispatches were generally addressed to <persName n="Cooper,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00280" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>, and that the <rs>President</rs> was away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>But we began to pluck up our spirits, and determined to see the end of the mystery.--So we went up to the <rs>Capitol</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>A member was on his feet, and, upon inquiry, we found that he had made the announcement, not exactly as it had been told to us, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He said the intelligence in question had been flashed along the wires.&#x0022; We determined to wait until he was done, to ask him for the source of his information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>He seemed determined to speak against time, and in the impatience of our humor at the time we could not wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>So we applied elsewhere &mdash; that is, to lobby members; but they could tell us no more than we have signified above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>We had resolved to give it over, when, meeting a gentleman connected with this paper on the steps, he told us that he had himself mentioned the rumor prevailing around town to a member of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, and that the enthusiastic speaker had gotten hold of it after it had been considerably adorned, and had put it forth in its then imposing shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Having thus traced the thing as far as we were able we returned, but found on our way that new evidence had been brought to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>It was now a wounded soldier, who had fought and bled in the terrible action that furnished the wholesale surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The report gathered strength and was proceeding merrily, when its career was cut short by the telegram which we publish to-day, and which we suppose is pretty nearly correct. </p> </div3>
