<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> [The announcement by <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>] that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will not recognize the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> until it has established its own independence to her satisfaction, puts a quietus to any expectations of aid and encouragement from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We have never known but <num value="1">one</num> man in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> who, at the beginning of this contest, doubled that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would have to succumb to <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName>, and that was <persName n="Floyd,,John,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Floyd,John,B.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We recollect well <persName n="Floyd,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>'s letter on the subject, which was transferred at the time to the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi></orgName>, and not <num value="1">one</num> opinion of which, so far as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was concerned, did the public endorse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It turns out, however, that <persName n="Floyd,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, with his accustomed sagacity, was right, and the rest of us all wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Whilst we have repeatedly warned the community against manifesting any dependence on foreign support, we have never entertained the shadow of a doubt that their interests would ultimately compel both <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to break the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If the counsels of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> had been followed, it would have been broken before this time <persName n="Massey,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Massey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Massey</surname></persName>, an influential member of Parliament, lately stated that the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> had repeatedly urged the <rs>British Government</rs> to that course, but his recommendations had all been declined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><q>&#x0022;Behold with how little wisdom the world is governed,&#x0022;</q> and never was that truth more strikingly illustrated than in the stupid and stolid indifference of the <rs>British Government</rs> to the fates of the <rs>South</rs> and of its own manufacturing population. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We need not recapitulate here the <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> interests &mdash; commercial, manufacturing, and political &mdash; which throw their gigantic weight into the scale against the <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> of <name>British</name> money in the <rs>North</rs> which might have been confiscated in the event of a war between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>That these interests would direct her course and make her an ally of the <rs>South</rs>, was always believed at the <rs>North</rs> more firmly and universally than it has ever been in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> and the <rs>Northern</rs> journals almost without exception have taken it for granted from the start that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would side with the <rs>South</rs>, have accused her of it in every daily issue, and have been endorsed by the evident convictions of their own Government, which has appropriated <num value="7000000">seven millions</num> of dollars for the fortification of the <rs>Northern</rs> seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>So that it cannot be said that the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders held out unreasonable expectations to the <rs>Southern</rs> people, for these expectations were as widely spread in the <rs>North</rs> as the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But they seem to have been doomed to disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <rs>North</rs> has managed to convince <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> that she can get the cotton without breaking the blockade, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has been credulous enough to swallow that story. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Another reason, besides her diversified and self evident interests, gave rise to the belief that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> would recognize Southern independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was, that, beyond all dispute, English anti-slavery influence has been brought to bear for nearly <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> upon the domestic institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs> in such a manner as to leave no doubt in reflecting minds that her object was, not to abolish slavery &mdash; for her commerce and manufactures were dependent upon its products &mdash; but to divide the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, on which she was dependent for products essential to her welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Slavery in <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, in other countries, received no attention from <name>English</name> philanthropists; it was only slavery in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> that excited their horror and aroused their energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It was to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> that they sent emissaries, stirring up the smouldering embers of fanaticism in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and urging on that war of aggression upon <placeName reg="Southern Rights">Southern Rights</placeName> which has culminated in the present bloody struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was abolition authors like <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Stowe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName>, and fugitive negroes from the <rs>Southern States</rs>, who were made the companions and pets of the <rs>British</rs> nobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>All the moral aid and comfort that any nation could give to say cause on the face of the earth was given by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to the abolition cause in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and never, till the <rs>Union</rs> was dissolved, did <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> ever discover that there was more than <num value="1">one</num> side to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> slavery question, and that the <rs>South</rs> was entitled to be heard at the tribunal of nations.--Since that period, the most intelligent and well written arguments we have ever seen in behalf of Secession have appeared in <name>English</name> journals; the character of the <rs>Southern</rs> people has been eloquently defended, and even the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, if not openly vindicated, apologized for and presented to the <rs>British</rs> public with every extenuating circumstance that human ingenuity could suggest.--A change so wonderful could never have occurred if the public sentiment of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, which is generally all-powerful in that kingdom, had not warmly favored a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, and a recognition of Southern independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> If <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> expects to get Southern cotton or Northern capital by this late disclosure of <name>British</name> policy, he only proves to the world that he is in his dotage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He will get neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Why did he not declare the position of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> long ago?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Why did he suffer both belligerents to remain in doubt till this time of the purposes of the <rs>British Government</rs>, and continue to excite hopes in the <rs>South</rs> and apprehensions in the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Let him now get the cotton if he can. If the <rs>South</rs> is worthy of independence, she will make a bonfire of the whole rather than permit the <rs>North</rs> or <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to seize a pound of it. Let the <rs>South</rs> now show her faith by her works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Let her plant no more cotton for the benefit of foreign or Northern consumers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Whatever be the result of this struggle &mdash; and if the <rs>Southern</rs> people are true to themselves, there can be but <num value="1">one</num> result &mdash; <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has lost forever the friendship of the <rs>North</rs>, and has thrown away from her that of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> last, another of the course of winter lectures was delivered in the <orgName n="Baptist Church 2" type="church">Second Baptist Church</orgName>, by <persName n="Baldwin,,O.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Baldwin,O.,P.,,"><foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, who chose for his subject the <q>&#x0022;Battle of Life. &#x0022;</q> It was gratifying to notice the large and appreciative audience which turned out to listen to the talented orator upon this interesting theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The house was well filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Increasing in interest as the course goes on, no <num value="1">one</num> can fail to notice the fact that these intellectual entertainments are gradually gaining in public favor, and, in proportion, are detracting from the villainous theatricals and disgusting pot-house performances endeavoring to thrive in this city, where a lady would blush to be seen, and where gentlemen seek a convenient pillar to screen them from observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Such places have been too long encouraged; they are the seed-plots from which the murrain vice extends over many a broad field of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They are productive of no single item of good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The better class of community &mdash; thinking men and women, should endeavor to crush out the morbid interest attached to such vile places &mdash; not, perhaps, by open warfare, but by persistently encouraging a system of intellectual entertainments, which shall gradually take the place of those only calculated to degrade and debase the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The increasing audiences at these lectures teach us they are rapidly gaining in public favor, and that they are being attended, not only on account of the charitable purpose for which they were inaugurated, but for their own intrinsic worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The battle of life was portrayed in charming style and abounded in axioms, as well as instructive and amusing passages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>While it served to while the evening hours pleasantly away, it also furnished material for much study and after-thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The large audience listened throughout the lecture with undivided attention, frequently interrupting the orator with applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The battle ground was chiefly confined to the space outside the rebel fortifications, extending up the river bank a distance of <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, to the point where <persName n="McClernand,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:McClernand,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClernand</surname></persName>'s forces rallied from the retirement which they were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> forced into by the impetuous charge of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>It must be remembered that it was here that the grand <unclear></unclear> was made by the rebels up the river bank, with the intention of turning our right bank and cutting their way out. Some <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> men composed the force sent out for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>They advanced under cover of a deadly fire of artillery, and steadily drove <persName n="McClernand,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:McClernand,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClernand</surname></persName>'s force before them a distance of <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> reds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Our troops here made a stand, and having been reinforced by <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> regiments, began the assault, before which the enemy were forced to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The ground was contested with desperation, and the slaughter on both sides was immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The whole space of <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> was strewed with dead, who lay in every imaginable shape and form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> Federals and Rebels were promiscuously mingled, sometimes grappling in the fierce death-throe, sometimes facing each other as they gave and received the fatal shot or thrust, sometimes lying across <num value="1">one</num> another, and again heaped in piles which lay <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7feet" type="distance">seven feet</measure> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>I could imagine nothing more terrible than the silent indications of agony that marked the features of the pale corpses which lay at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Though dead and rigid in every muscle, they still writhed and seemed to turn to catch the passing breeze for a cooling breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Starting eyes, gaping mouths, clenched hands, and strangely contracted limbs, seemingly dragging into the smallest compass, as if by a mighty effort to rend asunder some irresistible bend which held them down to the torture of which they died. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> <num value="1">One</num> sat against a tree, and, with mouth and eyes wide open; looked up into the sky as if to catch a glance at its fleeting spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Another clutched the branch of an overhanging tree, and hung half suspended, as in the death pang he raised himself partly from the ground; the other hand grasped this faithful musket, and the compression of the mouth told for the determination which would have been fatal to a foe had life bind a minute later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> clung with both hands to a bayonet which was buried in the ground, in the act of striking for the heart of a rebel foe. Great numbers lay in heaps, just as the fire of the artillery mowed them down, mangling their forms into an almost undistinguishable mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Many of our men had evidently fallen victims to the rebel sharpshooters, for they were pierced through the head by rifle bullets, some in the forehead, some in the eyes, others in the bridge of the nose, in the cheeks, and in the mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>This circumstance verified a statement made to me by a rebel officer among the prisoners, that their men were trained to shoot low and aim for the face, while ours, and general thing, fired at random, and shot over their heads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> The enemy in their retreat, carried off their wounded and a great many of their dead, so that ours far outnumbered them on the field.

<head>Burn the cotton and tobacco.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> Owing to the crowded state of our columns, we have been unable to give the proper notice to the important proceedings of the cotton and tobacco planters on the question of burning such portions of the cotton and tobacco in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> as may at any time be in danger of falling into the hands of the <name>Federalists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Upon the main question of doing this the <rs>Southern</rs> sentiment is unanimous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>As to that proposition of making the <rs>Government</rs> the purchaser of all these staples in the country, there will be a difference of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>There can be no doubt, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>that some plan may readily be adopted to accomplish the object of keeping these staples out of the hands of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> It is proper that some plan should be concerned in by the planters and the <rs>Government</rs>; but of <num value="1">one</num> thing we are satisfied, and that is. that, even in the absence of any plan, there is patriotism enough amongst the people to burn up all the cotton and tobacco that is likely to fall into the enemy's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It would be the most suicidal folly to permit the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to get a single bale of cotton or a pound of tobacco that can be burned before he gets it &mdash; The people are all convinced of this, and will destroy all, if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>They will burn as the enemy approaches, and if he overruns the country, they will burn it all. But this noble spirit is the best sign that the enemy cannot overruns the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>A people ready to make such sacredness cannot be conquered &mdash; their country cannot be overrun by an invading army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Independent of the spirit of resistance such a people must exhibit, the fact that the enemy will only seize ashes and smouldering ruins, instead of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars he expects to acquire by overrunning the land, will have a potent chest upon him. Nothing could be so delightful to his expectations as the appropriation to his own use of so much wealth that <hi rend="italics">did not belong to him</hi>--nothing could a grieve and sadden his heart as to be deprived of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> The burning of our staples will have another good effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It will teach the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> how much in earnest we are. They will understand from it that the <rs>South</rs> will never give up these staples to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and that through their invasion the foreign manufactories can never be supplied with cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>They will learn what a mistake they have made in respecting a blockade that is not efficient; but <num value="1">one</num> that has deprived them of that cotton which may now be destroyed, and the destruction of which must greatly prolong and increase commercial and manufacturing embarrassments and distresses. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>So far as concerts the <rs>Northern</rs> people and foreign nations, they must bide their time and be misled to the extent of their confidence in the lying organs that reach them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>But our own people, we are sure, are too well fortified against the weak devices of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>That <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> <q>&#x0022;flag of truce,&#x0022;</q> which has been productive of so much advantage to the enemy and so much injury to us, is the means employed to introduce the newspaper poison of the <rs>Northern</rs> press &mdash; to disseminate the falsehoods intended to act on the hopes and fears by turns of a people who, we are confident, are completely armed against both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>After ages will look back with amazement at the means employed to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>, and, if we be true to ourselves, that brave and loyal spirit which must triumph over them will be the admiration of the world as long as time shall last. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/> --My attention has been directed to a communication from your special correspondent, in this morning's issue of your paper, in which the following passage occurs: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> &#x0022;When the <rs>Wise Legion</rs> came <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the beach the steaming, with several flats attached, was close by the shore, and it was expected that the men would have been taken off. The commander of the tug was <persName n="Bacon,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="nearbymention:Bacon,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Bacon</surname></persName>, aid to <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>, and it was fair to presume that he would do all in his power to get as many as possible from the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The men, therefore, watched his motions with great interest, and saw the anchor hove up as if to comb in shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>All were prepared to wade out to the flats, which might have been done had they remained as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>When the anchor was up, <persName n="Bacon,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="nearbymention:Bacon,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Bacon</surname></persName> steemed away from the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, and left the men to be captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>All of the <rs>Wise Legion</rs> might have been saved, for they remained on the point <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> before being summoned to surrender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/> <q>&#x0022;As soon as it became evident the steamer was leaving, several prepared to fire upon the man in uniform standing upon the desk, but were restrained by their officers, who hoped that the tug was only turning to come nearer land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>But straight across the sound she was carried, towing the flats along, and we last saw her steaming for <placeName reg="Nags Head, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075828">Nag's Head</placeName>.--With little exertion, every man of the <rs>Wise Legion</rs> might have been taken on board, and had the flats been turned adrift many might have escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>What the excuse for such conduct was. I cannot imagine; it is to be hoped that <persName n="Bacon,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="nearbymention:Bacon,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Bacon</surname></persName> has a good <num value="1">one</num>, and will give it to the public without delay.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> Your correspondent is not mistaken in supposing that I would early and particularly notice so grave a charge as he here prefers; but common fairness and justice would have demanded that the writer should have communicated with myself before thus publicly and unhandsomely referring to the part which I bore in the <rs>Roanoke</rs> disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>A brief statement of the facts of the case, and the orders <unclear></unclear> which I acted, will exculpate me from the base and unwarranted charge of deserting my comrades-in-arms of the <rs>Wise Legion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>A life so frequently risked voluntarily, and without pay, for the <name>Legion</name>, is far less valuable to me than my reputation as a soldier, in this instance so wantonly aspersed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Your correspondent should have known and appreciated this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> On the morning of <date value="02-08">the 8th of February,</date> (the day on which our forces at <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName> surrendered,) I was ordered by <persName n="Wise,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>After landing <persName n="Fry,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Fry</surname></persName> and his command, I went ashore for the purpose of getting the barges and lighters, in a small boat, the shallowness of water not permitting the steamer to approach nearer than <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> of the landing. --On shore I met <persName n="Bolton,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Bolton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Bolton</surname></persName>, Wise Legion, who went with me to <persName n="Barry,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Barry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Barry</surname></persName> to get a detail of negroes, for the purpose of carrying the barges off to the steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>I also, at the same time, met <persName n="Dolan,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Dolan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Dolan</surname></persName>, formerly of <placeName key="tgn,7005562" n="1.000 9" reg="nicaragua">Nicaragua</placeName>, who was down in a cart after ammunition for the pieces at the barricade, who told me that <hi rend="italics">all was going right,</hi> and in whose opinion I had a great deal of confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>I left the beach with the barges and lighters, and taking them to the steamer, started for <placeName reg="Nags Head, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075828">Nag's Head</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Upon-reaching the steamer, having been up for several rights previously, and expecting no rest that night, I retired to the captain's booth to sleep across the <rs type="place">Sound</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>I heard nothing of a surrender until I reached <placeName reg="Nags Head, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075828">Nag's Head</placeName>, where I met <persName n="Duffield,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Duffield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Duffield</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Acting-Assistant-Adjutant General">Acting Assistant Adjutant General</rs>, on <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s staff, and he informed me that news had reached him of a surrender, when I told him I did not believe it, but if he advised, I would return immediately to the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Upon his advice I did so, and upon the passage picked up <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> small boats with from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="5">five</num> man in each, and learned from these escaping stragglers that our whole force had surrendered, and that it was worse than useless to proceed further towards the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Accordingly,) I returned to <placeName reg="Nags Head, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075828">Nag's Head</placeName>, arriving there about dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>I followed on <measure n="17miles" type="distance">seventeen miles</measure> up the beach, and over took the <rs>General</rs>, after an arduous march through the rain and sand, at Jallop's. I would further state that, when I left the beach at <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName>, <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Green,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="nearbymention:Green,T.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Green</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> was not out of sight on its march to the barricade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>I was not to be expected that I should bring off the island the very men whom I had just when there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>My orders and duty were to reinforce the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, not to bring away refugees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>I did not, when I left the island, anticipate a surrender, nor did those with whom I conversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>I was vested with no discretion to remain there after landing my men. I had only to en route my orders, which I did promptly, until informed by <persName n="Duffield,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Duffield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Duffield</surname></persName> of the surrender.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/> Whether the surrender was <q>&#x0022;deeply humiliating,&#x0022;</q> as the <rs>President</rs> declares, or whether it was premature, it is no part of my purpose to decide; and I carefully abstain from the had taste, and worse morals, of criticizing the conduct of others without the light of all the facts before me. At the same time, I demand a similar courtesy from others, whoever they may be. I had thought no member of the wise Legion &mdash; for many of whom I would willingly risk my life &mdash; would do me such injustice; but, if I have been mistaken, it is no part of my character or intention to permit such assaults with impunity. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Bacon,,W.,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="default:Bacon,W.,S.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName>  <surname>Bacon</surname></persName>, Wise Legion.</signed> </closer> </div3>
