<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He had married after the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war and was the possessor of <num value="1">one</num> of the finest estates in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> But it is not of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s career so much as of his military character and qualifications that I propose to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Looking at him in this light, therefore, he may be fully and correctly described in the <num value="5">five</num> following words: &#x0022;He is simply a soldier.&#x0022; It is not meant to be asserted that he is not a gentleman of intelligence and culture, and of polished manners in <rs n="General Society" type="misc">general society</rs>--for he is all this &mdash; but what I mean to affirm is, that when he is at the head of an army his whole being and character seem to be absorbed and merged in that of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>He is destitute of diplomacy, and knows neither friends nor foes in the discharge of his duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>If <num value="1">one</num> of his officers has been taken from civil life where he occupied a large space in public estimation, as in the case of <persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>, he shows him precisely the same consideration as he does the least distinguished of his subalterns who has won his way with his sword to the same position &mdash; neither more nor less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>He expects the <num value="1">one</num> to know his place and obey his orders as implicitly as the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> That this stern military rule is founded in abstract justice, if not in wisdom, no <num value="1">one</num> can deny; and yet it, with his earnest, perhaps austere manners, when occupied with business, has had the effect to render him unpopular with some of his officers, who, in their turn, have inoculated the subordinate officers in their respective commands with somewhat of their own feelings and opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is said, but with what truth I am not prepared to decide, that for some time past <persName n="Gen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Gen,nomatch:0"><surname>Gen</surname></persName>. B. has been more conciliatory in his bearing towards persons having business to transact with him. Be this as it may, it is certain that he has never turned aside from his duties in the field to court the favor of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>He is the hardest worker I have met with in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>. <orgName n="Day and Night" type="newspaper">Day and night</orgName>, in sunshine and in storm, in cold weather and in hot, he is ever at his post; and he allows no pleasure, however tempting, and no society, however charming, to take him away from his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>He not only works himself, but he requires every <num value="1">one</num> about him to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>His staff officers, like himself, know not what it is to enjoy a day of relaxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>I have thought that he remains too closely at his quarters, and that it would be better for his health and for the good of the army if he would inspect his lines oftener and see and judge for himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> Of his capacity for command I need not stop to speak; the world will judge him by his campaigns rather than by anything I might say. As an organizer of forces and an administrative officer, he ranks deservedly high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>There are no better soldiers in the whole army than his <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> troops, of which he had the exclusive training and disciplining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He possesses unusual quickness and capacity for business, and is a man of ardent patriotism and undoubted courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>If he did not seek death in the late battle on <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, he was certainly indifferent to it. He is a member of the <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal Church</orgName>, and in private life his habits are as exemplary as those of any <name>Christian</name> gentleman in all the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>His loss of property has been very heavy, the enemy having taken everything he possessed except his land, and driven his wife from her home with only the clothing in which she stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>In stature, he is a tall, thin man, with piercing black eyes, iron-gray hair, and heavy eyebrows that meet above the nose and impart to his face an aspect of much austerity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> His stern manners, unsocial habits, and devotion to business, have rendered him unpopular with many of his superior officers; while his neglect of those arts by which ambitious men are won't to win popular applause, has had much to do in shaping public opinion against him, in that it left his opponents free to say and publish what they pleased concerning him. As a disciplinarian, he is very rigid and has probably had as many executed as any <num value="2">two</num> commanders in the army; and yet he is far more popular with his soldiers and regimental officers than with those in higher positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>As a strategist and fighter, his friends may well point to the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs> and the operations which preceded it; and yet, in a contest before the people through the public prints, the most commonplace of his political <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> is more than a match for him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> When <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> was about to relinquish the command of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, I called, as others did, to bid him adieu.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He spoke freely and feelingly of the recent disaster, and seemed to be far more concerned for the success of our cause and the welfare of the troops than about his own reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>He remarked that he did not know but that <placeName reg="Sidney Johnston">Sidney Johnston</placeName>'s rule, that a commander should be judged by the results of his campaigns, was a just standard, and that so far as his fall was the consequence of his own conduct, he was prepared to accept it and abide by it; but insofar as it was the result of the incapacity, disobedience or perversity of others he thought he ought to be relieved, and he believed that impartial history, when all the facts were brought to light, would do it. His own disgrace or destruction was a matter of but little consequence; he had lost his property and his health in the service, and was ready to give his life and reputation for the success of the cause, of which he entertained no doubt whatever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> Recalling to mind how much he had lost, and how much he had suffered in health and reputation, I confess, as I bade him farewell, that I could not withhold my sympathy and admiration from a man who was so firm and unselfish in the hour of adversity, and in whose resolute eyes there glistened a tear, not for himself, but for his bleeding country. </p> <closer> <signed>Sallust.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> At sunset we were <placeName><distance reg="85miles">eighty five miles</distance> from Wilmington</placeName> Bar. At <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time> the wind, which had been light from the <name>north</name> and <name>west</name>, suddenly sprang up, and in the course of <num value="1">one</num> hour blew a gale causing an ugly cross sea, and reducing the speed of our ship from <num value="11">eleven</num> knots to <num value="5.5">five and a half</num> which was the utmost we could get out of her with <measure n="30l." type="pounds"><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> of steam. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> Things began to look squally as to our being able to make the run in time, but it was too late to think of turning back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>We were, too, at this time passing <num value="2">two</num> suspicious lights, which we took for the outer vessels of the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>At <num value="11">11</num> I hauled her into <placeName reg="Masenboro' inlet">Masenboro' inlet</placeName>, as I found if I did not met smooth water I could not save my time, and it was not until <time value="4.5oclock">4&#x00BD; o'clock</time> that I made the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>About noon, while to the southward and eastward of the inlet, as soon as I got fairly under the beach and in <measure n="18feet" type="distance">eighteen feet</measure> of water, I sent word to <persName n="Gray,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Gray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gray</surname></persName> and <persName n="Nicholson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Nicholson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Nicholson</surname></persName>, my <num value="2">two</num> passengers, that it would be impossible for me to save my dark to <sic>to</sic> the fort, and that at daylight we would be subjected to a very heavy fire (in all probability) from the fleet, as I was determined to try to run along the beach, (I had, however, no other chance,) and that if they would get ready I would land them in the little bay of <placeName reg="Masenboro' inlet">Masenboro' inlet</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>This they bravely refused, saying it would take too much time, and that if I could stand the fire of the fleet they could too. I therefore prepared for the worst, and ordered the anchors taken in on deck, unstocked, and lashed down, the colors set, and all hands but the officer of the watch and the <num value="2">two</num> men at the wheel sent below, determining, if I had to lose her, to make it cost the enemy dearly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> Just as day was dawning we touched the beach slightly, but did not stop, and while hauling away from it, saw a gunboat standing directly across our bow, (she must evidently have heard our wheels,) and was steering so as to cut us off from the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>We being in <num value="3">three</num> fathoms of water, I was much surprised to find a boat running so boldly for us. To pass outside of him would be to lose my ship, for he would then cut me off from the support I expected from our own batteries in a few miles more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>To run my ship ashore at this point would have been madness, for the beach here is an <hi rend="italics">outer <num value="1">one</num>,</hi> the sound extending inside of it for miles, and consequently I could expect no protection, and my whole ship company would either be destroyed on this bold beach or taken by the enemy prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>To turn back and run to sea was to give the ship to the enemy without an effort to save her. I therefore determined to try and pass inshore of the bend or over him, (not dreaming that he would dare run into <measure n="18feet" type="distance">eighteen feet</measure> of water.) This matter was soon decided, as we approached each other rapidly, and I could hear the noise of his men preparing for action, &#x0026;c., and when about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> from him I hailed him, telling him he would be afoul of me, hoping to induce the thought that I was <num value="1">one</num> of their own ships, but was soon made aware of my mistaken opinion by a broadside of grape and canister, accompanied by a volley of musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>I then ordered my ship pointed for her, and hoped to strike her just forward of her waist boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Unfortunately he perceived this move of mine; and shifted his helm, causing his vessel to swing away from me, and making it impossible to strike fair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> Our ships came together the next moment with a fearful crash, carrying away his starboard boat rail and part of his stem and cutwater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>My engine was kept working to its full capacity, as I had but <num value="1">one</num> chance of getting clear of him in case I failed to sink him, and that was to force my ship past him before he could board, as I distinctly heard him call away his boarders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>In this last attempt I failed, as the ships were both going ahead, and had now swung broadside on, and he firing broadside after broadside into us while in this condition, and almost at the same time boarding us on the port quarter and wheelhouse guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Then ensued a scene which none but an eye-witness would believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Officers and men rushing along our deck, shooting and cutting at everything that came to sight, and even shooting, in their mad career, <num value="1">one</num> of their own men &mdash; and in the case of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">Jany</month></dateStruct>, of my ship, shooting him as he was coming up the hatchway to give himself up. Having satisfied themselves with this (courageous charge) they went below and broke open everything that came to sight, state-rooms, trunks, boxes, &#x0026;c., officers and men quarreling over trunks for the contents and the owners standing by. This robbery and carouse was kept up until the arrival of <persName n="Ridgely,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Ridgely,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Ridgely</surname></persName>, in the <term type="ship">flag-ship</term> <rs type="ship">Shenandoah</rs>, when it was quickly put a stop to by the appearance of <persName n="Skerritt,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Skerritt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Skerritt</surname></persName>, to whom it was reported, (<persName n="Skerritt,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Skerritt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Skerritt</surname></persName> is an officer and gentleman of the old navy.) Not <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of the capturing ship &mdash; the <rs>Niphon</rs> &mdash; belonging to this class of officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> The ship was then plugged (having received <num value="41">forty one</num> shots in her hull,) and sent to <placeName reg="Beaufort, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2073632">Beaufort, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The crew otherwise were sent North in the <term type="ship">transport</term> <rs type="ship">Newbern</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> Thus ended the fate of the favorite <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Ella</rs> and <persName><foreName>Annie</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>A more cowardly and murderous fire a vessel was never subjected to, and the conduct of the boarding the most unheard of barbarity upon record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The officers of my ship behaved &mdash; as we all had a right to expect of them &mdash; cool, determined, and at their posts all of them, as they had often said if they were killed their bodies would be found at their stations in their engine-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Strange as it may appear, her engine was not struck, although the balls are to be seen sticking in the wood work of the gallery frame. </p>
