<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> On the subject of corn supply there had also been an interesting debate, growing out of the proposition to reduce the quantity of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/><num value="1">One</num> member made a calculation in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> to show that the supposed surplus of corn &mdash; say <num value="10000000">10,000,000</num> bushels &mdash; was fallacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The estimated crop of <num value="15000000">15,000,000</num> bushels, on the supposed bales of <num value="14">14</num> bushels to the acre, was not verified by the facts in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, as it was notorious that in the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> region the yield was very short from a diminished breadth of land planted, owing to the absence of labor in the army, and to the excessive drought of last summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> when in the upper counties it was common for <num value="3040">30,40</num>, and <num value="50">50</num> bushels to be produced to the acre, the average for the <rs>State</rs> was only <num value="16">16</num> bushels, while in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, in many parts of the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> region, the production was only <num value="10">10</num> and <num value="15">15</num> bushels &mdash; Even in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Georgia</placeName> the average was not over <num value="10">10</num> bushels, as the experience of planters will testify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>From these promises he said that it was evident that no such surplus is on hand for the use of the army, and for the people of the mountains where the scarcity is most alarming. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> What reply was made to these statsments does not appeal in our exchanges; but there is evidently a fallacy in the calculation of the quantity that may be produced to the acre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Hitherto our planters have mainly warned only the poorest of their lands for corn and reserved the most fertile for cotton, and thus the yield has not shown the <name>Cerelly</name> of the soil for massing the farmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Cotton now being limited the richer lands will be put into corn and better worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The yield therefore, will probably be nearly double the above estimate </p> </div3>
