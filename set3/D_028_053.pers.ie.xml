<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> --The immediate effect of a snub is to induce a feeling of deprivation and exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Its physical sensation is like the sudden loss of a garment, and the consequent rush of cold; and we do, in fact, lose, in the surprise, the snug covering of our usual self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>We are dependent creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>We are apt, on the instant of others not respecting us, to feel ourselves not respectable, small, inferior, incompetent, unable to hold our own; and hence the main annoyance.--That which predominates in a snub is the pressing difficulty of how to take it. We are caught unawares without our weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>There are assaults and aggressions of a nature to arouse our courage and to quicken our powers, which call for and suggest an answer, which may be resented on the spot without injury to our dignity; but this is not <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>All that can be done generally under a snub &mdash; all, at least, that we actually do &mdash; is to pull up suddenly with an inner blank sense of tingling, a doubt as to where we are, a confused feeling of having the worst of it, which our instinct teaches us to keep to ourselves as much as possible; for it must be noted that a snub is, of necessity, a sudden blow, given when we are at a disadvantage, careless, and at case in the security of social intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Social intercourse takes sympathy for granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>It assumes <num value="1">one</num> general genial sentiment, a disposition to follow a lead, to pursue objects in the spirit in which they are started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>A snub is a check, a blank, it is a curtain suddenly drawn down, it is pulling up against a dead wall, it is cold obstruction and recoil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Either the snubber has authority on his side, and we have laid ourselves open by some inadvertence, by a misplaced trust in his condescension &mdash; and we have seen parents painfully snub their children in this sort, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> allowing them liberties, then stopping them with a harsh check in mid-career of spirits, and this in the presence of strangers,--or, perhaps, we have given way to enthusiasm, and are met by ridicule; or we have made a confidence which we think tender, and it is received with indifference; or we tell a story, and are asked for the point of it; or we are given to understand that we are mistaken where we have assumed ourselves well informed; or our taste is coolly set at naught; or we talk and are reminded that we are prosy; or we are brought face to face with our ignorance in a way to make us feel it most keenly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The strength of a snub lies in the sudden apprehension that we have committed ourselves, and a consequent painful sense of insignificance,--that there is somebody quite close to us, regardless of our feelings, looking down on us, and ostentatiously unsympathizing. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>All these officers are requested, and those connected with this army are directed, to receive and receipt for all arms and equipments, whatever their condition, and forward the same, with a duplicate receipt, to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and report their proceedings to these headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.
