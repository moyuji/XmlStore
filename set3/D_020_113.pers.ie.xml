<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> --A correspondent demands of us sundry information--<q>&#x0022;can you give us some particulars as to the principles by which our <rs type="role2">President</rs> is governed in his appointments of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>; and also of the difference between what is called a &#x0027;full General&#x0027; and a <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> of the <rs>Provisional Army</rs>?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> We might plead in reply, that we have never graduated at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, nor rubbed up against the walls of the institution; and therefore are to be presumed entirely ignorant of all military matters: or else, if ever so well informed through some miraculous agency unknown to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, are not authorized to speak, having no diploma from that crack <orgName n="North institution" type="institution">institution of the North</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As editors, however, are a notoriously presumptuous set of people, claiming to hold </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>--a charter illinoitable as the winds, </l><l>To blow on whom they please, </l> </lg> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> we shall make bold to vindicate this reputation, by responding to the interrogatories of our, correspondent; premising, however, that as military learning is not a speciality with the profession, our response on the subject must not be accepted as infallible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> In fully appointed armies, we suppose that the order of rank, beginning at the highest grades, is as follows: General, <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs>, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs>, <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Captain">Captain</rs>, &#x0026;c. We believe in the army of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> there is no such rank as <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>; and that next after full General comes <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Whether the rank of <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> is unknown to our law or not, it is certain that no officer in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> holds that commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>All the rest of the grades we have enumerated, however, are represented in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We suppose the full General in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service corresponds with the <rs>Field</rs>-<rs type="role" reg="Marshal">Marshal</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> in the <rs>Federal</rs> service, and the rank usually held by commanders of divisions operating independently in the field, in all the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> services. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> There are <num value="5">five</num> full <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, whose relative rank, as among themselves, is as follows: <num value="1">1</num>. <persName n="Cooper,,S.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Cooper,S.,,,"><foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>; <num value="2">2</num>. <persName n="Johnston,,A.,Sydney,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Johnston,A.,Sydney,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>Sydney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>; <num value="3">3</num>. <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>; <num value="4">4</num>. <persName n="Johnston,,Joseph,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>; <num value="5">5</num>. <persName n="Beauregard,,G.,T.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.--What principles governed the <rs>President</rs> in thus arranging the relative rank of these officers, we cannot undertake to explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We believe that the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> sanctioned the schedule, and what the <rs>President</rs>, by and with the advice and consent of the <rs>Congress</rs>, has done, let no man question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We will only say, that if <hi rend="italics">we</hi> <sic>had had</sic> the arrangement of relative rank among these <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, the gradation would have been very different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We believe all the full <rs>Generals</rs> are graduates of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Within the last month or <num value="2">two</num> quite a number of commissions have been issued for <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They have been announced from time to time by the press, as they were issued, and we need not enumerate the recipients of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Several of them have been conferred in promotion from <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs>-ships; others have been conferred, originally, upon persons holding no previous commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We believe the oldest commission of <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> in the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">Provisional Army of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName> is that of <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Polk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We think we are not mistaken in saying that these commissions have, in every case, so far, been conferred on graduates of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Whether it be the intention of the <rs>President</rs> to confine himself in the conferring of them to that class of persons, we cannot undertake to say; though we trust not; for <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, however admirable an institution it may be for the formation of drill officers and engineers, and however valuable as a school for tacticians and disciplinarians, is certainly incapable of conferring that genius which is born with and which makes the <rs>General</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> In regard to the principles which govern the <rs>President</rs> in conferring rank and making promotions, we of course can say but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It must be remembered that after passing the grade of <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, promotion does not go by seniority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Upon the <rs>President</rs> is conferred an absolute discretion in respect to the commissioning of general officers; subject only to the ratification of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This feature is not peculiar to the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, but belongs to that of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, and of course obtains throughout the military establishments of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is a feature that cannot be changed, and is absolutely necessary to the harmony and efficiency of the service and to the ends of subordination and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If Congress were entrusted with this power, the baneful influence of politics would take possession of the army and utterly demoralize the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The whole subject of promotion is, therefore, wisely left at the discretion of the <rs>President</rs>; and we feel bound to say that, so far as we can perceive, the discretion has not been abused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>There may be room, here and there, for criticism, and probably mistakes, which are unavoidable by all men, may have been committed; but we see nothing to impeach a sound, just, and patriotic intention on the part of the <rs>Executive</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> When mention is made of commissions in the <q>&#x0022;Provisional Army&#x0022;</q> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the meaning is that the commissions are not permanent as if in the regular military service of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, but are to cease at the termination of the war. The <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">Provisional Army</orgName> is raised to meet the exigency of the war, and is not a permanent establishment of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Commissions in the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">Provisional Army of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName> are to be considered in contradistinction to commissions emanating from the <name>States</name> individually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>For instance, we believe <persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pillow</surname></persName> holds a commission as <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> from the <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">State of Tennessee</placeName>, while <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Polk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> holds <num value="1">one</num> of the same tenor from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We believe we have practically responded to the interrogatory of our correspondent. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We have urged the idea on various occasions, and it demands the attention of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are constructing iron-plated ships to attack our batteries, we should defend our batteries in like manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Ships, without this plating, ought not to be able to overcome shore batteries properly established and manned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We trust that, after the lessons lately received upon our sea coast, we shall be prepared to give the enemy a proper reception hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The enemy's strong arm is his navy; but, if we pay timely and proper attention to our shore batteries, we can easily neutralize his advantage in that respect. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> There was a rumor here this evening that the enemy had advanced upon <placeName reg="Germantown, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099260">Germantown</placeName>, and had driven in our pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This I believe to be untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Yesterday I was some distance into the enemy's country, and quite <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> beyond our line of pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We saw no signs of the <rs>Federals</rs> beyond a small party on a foraging expedition, who fled at our approach. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It seems they were out on a thieving expedition and had been accompanied by others who had been gone but a few moments when our party came up. The men were very silly and uncultivated, and all seemed to care very little about their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They were men of no sensibility or spirit, and I could but think it was no wonder we whipped them in every fight. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>They seemed to know very little about army movements &mdash; in fact very few questions were asked them for fear it might annoy them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They kept quiet for a time, but all could not be restrained, and giving <num value="3">three</num> cheers, they crowded around the prisoners. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> The village of <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName> looks quite deserted, but few of the citizens remaining in their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The houses have not been disturbed by our pickets, who are now in the village, and all kinds of property has been respected by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But <num value="1">one</num> house has been disturbed, and that was on account of a note that was found in it. It was as follows: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> I give the note from memory, but believe it is correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It was certainly very indiscreet in <persName n="Bailey,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Bailey,A.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Bailey</surname></persName>, if she be loyal at heart, to underscore the word forced, as if to make it appear she was a martyr, driven from her home against her will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I believe none of the citizens were ordered away from the town with the army, but were merely advised to leave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> The enemy have been near the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> but twice or <num value="3">three</num> times since we fell back from it, and then only in small parties, which were probably out on reconnoitering or foraging expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>On the <placeName key="tgn,7015783" n="1.000 8" reg="annandale, fairfax, virginia">Annandale</placeName> road we heard a few men had been up early in the morning, but saw none near by. Riding down the turnpike, we finally saw a small party, some <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> in number, who ran as we came in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>They seemed to be pickets, as they were posted on an eminence commanding a view of the country for some miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I believe they have some force near <placeName key="tgn,7015783" n="1.000 8" reg="annandale, fairfax, virginia">Annandale</placeName>, and along the line from there to <placeName reg="Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia" key="tgn,2111722">Falls Church</placeName> and <placeName reg="Lewinsville">Lewinsville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> From the top of the hotel in <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName> we could still see the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> flying from <placeName reg="Uptons Hill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2741436">Upton's Hill</placeName>, and also the line of their fortifications by <persName n="Taylor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Tom,,,"><surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="White,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><surname>White</surname></persName>'s hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>No other changes were visible except those made by the fall of the leaves, which gave a less obstructed view of their works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I believe there has been no advance since we left the town, except by small parties of scouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>I cannot help believing, however, the statement made some time ago that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has tried to advance at <num value="3">three</num> different times, but his men failed to come up to the mark. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Returning from <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, we called upon <persName n="Squires,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Squires,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Squires</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">First Company</orgName>, <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, now on picket duty near <placeName reg="Germantown, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099260">Germantown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>We found the camp on a little hill, in front of which was a valley and a small stream of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>This stream has been a source of much amusement to the boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Having nothing to do, time hangs heavily on their hands, and they have nearly exhausted their stock of sports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The other day, however, some tiny boats were made with paper sails, and now they have a regatta every day, sometimes betting heavily on the speed of the different boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><num value="1">One</num> can hardly imagine the fun or the amount of excitement such simple sports will produce until he has been for a long time deprived of every amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I recollect a few years ago, while on a voyage to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, how hard pushed we were to occupy the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Reading was impossible; cords played out; chess too much labor; watching the petrel and the huge schools of porpoise had become an old story, and so we collected our party and formed a <orgName n="Ways and Means Committee" type="committee">committee of ways and means</orgName> to devise amusements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>It was laughable to see how old and young enjoyed the most childish sports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Finally, St. Agnes light came in sight, and we run into the <placeName reg="English Channel" key="tgn,7005239">English Channel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>When the pilot boat came in sight, bets were made as to which leg he would put over the rail <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; whether he would wear a coat or a northwester; a cap or a <q>&#x0022;stove pipe&#x0022;</q> on his head, or whether he was fat or lean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The bets being made, there was great excitement until the little man was at the helm steering away towards <placeName key="tgn,7011467" n="1.000 10" reg="Beachy Head,East Sussex,England,United Kingdom,Europe">Beachy Head</placeName> and the bets decided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> Some of the boats the boys had made were fine models, and had been made and rigged with especial reference to fast sailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Really, the yacht race was very interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> There is really nothing to write about of interest, and I almost give up all hope of a fight at this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Still, I believe our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> expect <num value="1">one</num> before snow comes again, upon general principles merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>During the evening he made them a speech, which was loudly cheered, and which gave great pleasure to the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Visits from such men, and speeches to the volunteers has a good effect, and seems to enliven the tedium of camp life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>I wish it were more common. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> Owing to the recent rain the roads have become in very bad condition, and in some places almost impassable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> I was engaged at the above-named theatre for <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure>, with the privilege of <num value="8">eight</num>, and made my appearance in the new piece entitled <q>&#x0022;The Elves, or The Statue Bride,&#x0022;</q> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="09-25">the 25th September.</date> At my suggestion, and under my direction, my agent gave the management the plans of the last scene, and superintended its getting up, with the understanding, of course, that it was to be used only for me. I was received, as I am proud to say I am always in <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName>, most warmly, and the houses were full every night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Immediately after the production of the piece, the management commenced importuning my agent to induce me to perform on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> nights, going so far as to say, <q>&#x0022;Can't we get her to play <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>?&#x0022;</q> My reply through my agent, was that if I played <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, I should have no hesitation in playing <hi rend="italics">every</hi> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>; but that it had been expressly understood in my engagements here that under no consideration whatever would I perform on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>; that I would refuse the best engagement ever offered rather than break this resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>No more was said on the subject at that time, but it soon became apparent that the piece was to be played without me on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. I protested against this, and, I think, with reason, considering I had paid for half of it <measure n="137dollars" type="currency">one hundred and thirty-seven dollars</measure>, and did not wish it played to the manager's profit and to my loss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> Notwithstanding my protest, the piece was put up for <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, I received a note from <persName n="Coad,,H.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="default:Coad,H.,,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Coad</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, prompter of the theatre, stating that he was desired to say from the manager, that the <q>&#x0022;Love <persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>&#x0022;</q> and a farce would constitute the performance for <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>. Whether this was done with the idea of making me appear in old pieces, and of keeping the <q>&#x0022;Elves&#x0022;</q> to their own especial profit, or merely to frighten me, I cannot say. At any rate, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I saw <sic>yestereay</sic> morning in the newspapers, was an announcement to the effect that I was that evening to appear in the <q>&#x0022;Elves.&#x0022;</q> During the day, however, my agent received a letter from the manager, stating that I had broken my engagement with the <rs>Metropolitan Theatre</rs> by not playing on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and by not sending him the manuscript of <persName n="Taylor,,Tom,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="default:Taylor,Tom,,,"><foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s <q>&#x0022;Overland Route;&#x0022;</q> consequently he would not allow me to perform that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Now, the claiming of manuscripts was simply an idle excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>By the statement of the machinist, the scenes could not be prepared <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> in <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>; and I may state here that it is not usual for artists to give into <hi rend="italics">uncertain</hi> managerial hands valuable manuscripts <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> before they can be made legitimate use of. Besides, the manager knew that the parts were not even copied out, and that I was hard at work on them myself, intending to give them into the theatre as soon as <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> of the <num value="3">three</num> scenes should be completed by <persName n="Rogers,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, the scene painter, and <persName n="Stackhouse,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Stackhouse,nomatch:0"><surname>Stackhouse</surname></persName>, the machinist &mdash; without which it would have been a waste of time to rehearse.--Having explained that point, I come to the other so-called violation of my engagement, namely, the not playing on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> nights.--I can only say, it has been clearly understood by all the managers in this city that I would not engage to do so. I have steadily refused, when I knew my share of the receipts would be from a <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> to <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two hundred dollars</measure> every <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>; so it is plain the manager had no shadow of right to demand or expect me to perform on those particular evenings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>But I would rather be, as I am, deprived of my engagement &mdash; which was averaging <measure n="771dollars" type="currency">seven hundred and seventy-one dollars</measure> a night (gross receipts!)--than to act in violation of the law and my own convictions of right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> In conclusion, I must state that I can have no controversy with the manager of the <rs>Metropolitan Theatre</rs>, for, in self-respect, I could not descend to such a thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> That <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has far too great a respect for international law and morality, and far too much consideration for future and remote consequences, forcibly to interfere with or prohibit the blockade we have, we trust, made clear in previous numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>But those, who in their dread of a scarcity of cotton, would have our Government take this perilous and unwarrantable step, would do well to consider whether, apart from the impropriety and irrationality of their demand, they are not defeating their own end by making it. The seceding States have based much of their action and many of their expectations upon the conviction that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> cannot do without their cotton, and that, if it be long enough withheld, she will interfere to break the blockade by force; in other words, that he will embrace their cause and virtually declare war against their rival; that is, that she will take precisely the line which these complainants are urging her to take. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> The South is deliberately working and toiling to force us into a quarrel with the <rs>North</rs>; and <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> are found ready to fall into the trap, and help her sinister designs! 1s it not obvious that so long as the <rs>Confederates</rs> entertain any hopes that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will thus interfere, they will obstinately retain their cotton on the plantations, and effectually prevent our getting it in any mode?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>And is it not obvious that nothing will so foster and prolong these fallacious hopes as the language which, under the dread of coming pressure, these inconsiderate merchants and manufacturers are using?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>That the distress must be great and wide-spread in the industrial districts of <placeName reg="Cheshire, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008114">Cheshire</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName>, if the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> crop is really and permanently withheld, we entertain no doubt, and we are not surprised that all concerned (and who is not concerned?) should view the prospect with alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>But the sole practical question is, how can the threatened danger be most effectually, and yet rightfully averted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Now, as we have repeatedly shown, the resources of the <rs>South</rs>, never very vast or very ready, are derived solely from the sales of their produce; for of accumulated funds they have no great store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The sale of their cotton crop will, therefore, soon become to them an object of absolute necessity; and when they feel this, and can be definitely satisfied that forcible intervention from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is an idle dream, they will hurry their cotton down to the ports or to some easy and safe distance from the coast, so as to have it ready for shipment by any vessels that arrive and are prepared for the risk of endeavoring to evade the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>At present they feel at ease, for there is no cotton gathered and packed, and no ships ready to receive it; so they can safely indulge in a menace, which they hope will bring terrified <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to their aid. But as soon as the cotton is ready to come forward, we have no doubt it will be transmitted to the coast, provided they can be made to renounce their hopes of foreign interposition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> Now, as far as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is concerned, we believe we may confidently assert that her interposition will be strictly limited to insisting that the blockade of every port announced to be closed shall be <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> efficient, and continuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>She must take care that the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName> shall be ample and impartial, shall be considerable enough really to prevent ingress and egress, and shall connive at the escape of no ships, and shall give papers to none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>If these requirements are not fulfilled &mdash; and we are by no means satisfied on this head &mdash; then we are entitled, and are bound to notify to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that the blockade of that port or that coast is not effective, is not therefore valid by the law of nations, cannot be recognized by us, and will not be respected by our ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>If we are vigilant enough in this respect, we apprehend that the blockade in several quarters will be found inadequate, and will have to be renounced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But this is a very different matter from interfering to <q>&#x0022;prohibit the blockade&#x0022;</q> altogether, on the ground that it is very mischievous to us.--The <num value="1">one</num> proceeding is strictly in accordance with international law and justice.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> --We are not surprised to learn that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who boast of outnumbering the <rs>South</rs> <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, are yet unwilling to thrust their precious carcases within reach of Southern bullets without artificial protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Scientific American" type="newspaper">Scientific American</orgName></hi> describes a breastplate, which, it is said, is being extensively worn by the officers and men in the <rs>Federal Army</rs> before <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It is composed of thin spring steel, and is worn between the cloth and the lining of a common military vest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It has <num value="2">two</num> leaves which lap at the edges when the vest is buttoned, so as to cover the entire chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It weighs only <measure n="3l." type="pounds"><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure> and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, and, according to the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>.</hi> can be worn with case by any officer or soldier during the most active exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>That journal adds that it is very strong in proportion to its weight, can resist the thrust of a bayonet or sword, and will resist the bullets of muskets and pistols at ranges which would otherwise be fatal to life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> If this be true, which we may be permitted to doubt, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have the honor of being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> nation of modern times whose soldiery were afraid to take the field until they could be clothed in coat of mail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>And the breastplate itself, like most <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> inventions, seems to be of little account in the hour of trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It seems to have done very little service at <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, neither to have kept out bullets nor bayonets, nor prevented the men from taking to the water like so many ducks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have yet to discover that the inside of a soldier's heart is more important than the outside, and that if the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Nature has not placed a good, stout heart in the interior, not even <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> brass on the outside can make him a hero. </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> However, we doubt the whole story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>A breastplate would be a poor protection to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The region that contains the heart is with him the very smallest fragment of his whole body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>No experienced <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fighter ever aims at the heart of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The most skillful shot could not be expected to hit so minute an object, which yet is so hard that the toughest bullets cannot crack it. The head is a better target; and the long, agile legs, better still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The next inventor, if he desires to be of service to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, must adapt a breastplate to the rear instead of the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/><num value="1">One</num> of the ancient failings of the universal <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation was its facility of lying, but it remained for the war to develop its talents in a way which has astonished mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The veteran sinner is so addicted to lying that he would blush to the roots of his hair if he happened to stumble over a single truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Here he is, in a late number, describing <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s preparations to swallow the whole <rs>South</rs> at a single mouthful with as much audacity of statement and minuteness of detail as if every word that he uttered was Gospel truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The fact that all that he says now is but a rehash of his <q>&#x0022;Grand Army&#x0022;</q> articles before the <date value="07-21">21st of July</date> does not abash him in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>He now informs us that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has been able any day since the <date value="09-01">1st of September</date> to overwhelm the <rs>South</rs> with his prodigious numbers, but has graciously postponed it till a period fast approaching the annihilating blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The question then arises, why did he not amuse the leisure of the long interval by preventing the erection of the formidable batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs> which blockade the <rs>Federal Capital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>If he did not know of their construction, occupying months as it did, then he has been outgeneraled, and has found in our Southern <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> his masters in the art of war. If he did know, and had the numbers <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> reports, why did he permit the erection to go on?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The truth is, it has taken the <q>&#x0022;Grand Army&#x0022;</q> a long time to recover from the back-breaking knock down of the <date value="07-21">21st of July;</date> and if it is in force now in numbers and discipline, it has yet to obtain the confidence and manhood necessary to meet men who are prepared and willing to die rather than surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>All the falsehoods that <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> can manufacture will never cloud the vision or daunt the souls of the <rs n="Spartan" type="ethnic">Spartans</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>An equal number of Federal prisoners will, of course, be hung to atone for the privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Then the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will retaliate for this just punishment, which will ensure instant retaliation on our side, and the war will ultimately become <num value="1">one</num> of extermination, and <q>&#x0022;no quarter asked or given.&#x0022;</q> This is what it ought to have been from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>A Berlin paper has an admirable hit at the <rs>Bull Runners</rs> on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is difficult for the civilized world to understand how men who are in earnest can avail themselves of such paltry pretexts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>What would be said of our Southern Army if its members should disband, at a period when their services were needed, because the time of their enlistment had expired?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> clause of the <orgName type="regiment" key="7Section">7th section</orgName> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> article of the <rs>Provisional Constitution</rs> of the <hi rend="italics">Confederate</hi> States, in pursuance of which you are now assembled, declared, in the exact words of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the <hi rend="italics">United States</hi></rs>, that <q>&#x0022;no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on the presentment of the <rs>Grand Jury</rs>, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in service in time of war or public danger.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The only authority possessed by the <rs>Courts</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to take cognizance of any offence is bestowed by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <hi rend="italics">Confederate</hi> States, and acts of Congress made in pursuance of powers therein granted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> You have, therefore, no such general authority to inquire into offences against the laws of the <rs>State</rs>, or against good morals, or good order, as is possessed by Grand Juries in the <rs type="place">State Courts</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> You have, in general, to deal only with those crimes and misdemeanors which are declared to be such by the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; or by statutes or laws of a State or of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</hi> which were adopted by the <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="37Section">37th section</orgName> of the act passed by the <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName>, and approved on the <date value="1861-03-16">16th of March, 1861,</date> provides that <q>&#x0022;the laws of the <hi rend="italics">United</hi> States in regard to crimes and offences&#x0022;</q> shall <q>&#x0022;be in force until otherwise provided by law of Congress.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> Thus, the criminal laws of the <hi rend="italics">United</hi> States having been expressly adopted by Congress, became laws of the <hi rend="italics">Confederate</hi> States--that is to say, those laws of the <hi rend="italics">United</hi> States which were passed before the act aforesaid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> Under these laws of the <hi rend="italics">United</hi> States and the criminal laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, you may inquire into and present a great number of different offences, a few of which I will mention &mdash; murder, manslaughter on the high seas, or in bays or rivers <hi rend="italics">where the tide ebbs and flows,</hi> committed on board of ships or other vessels belonging to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; mutiny or revolt committed on board of such vessels; cruelty to seamen; stealing or taking letters from the mail or <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>; and counterfeiting and forgery of various kinds, fall under your cognizance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> To forge the <name>Treasury</name> notes of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has been deemed by Congress a crime so high in its character, and so extremely mischievous in its consequences, that it was thought necessary to make it punishable with death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Even to pass, utter, or publish as true, any forged Treasury note, knowing it to be forged, is punishable in the same way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> Treason is another offence to which I will call your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>By the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName> of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, which is copied, with the substitution of the word <q>&#x0022;Confederate&#x0022;</q> for the word <q>&#x0022;United,&#x0022;</q> from the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <hi rend="italics">United</hi> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/><q>&#x0022;Treason against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> shall consist only in levying was against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort;&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of <num value="2">two</num> witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> To adhere to the enemies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, giving them aid and comfort in any way in carrying on war against us, is therefore, as you see, as much treason as to be actually engaged in the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> The Constitution declares that <q>&#x0022;Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press;&#x0022;</q> and mere words, whether written or spoken, can never amount to treason, unless they are intended to give, or do give, in some way, aid to the enemy in carrying on the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> To give to the enemy information as to the number of our troops, or the position or movements of our army, or any other information which would be of service to him in the conduct of the war, would be treason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> To trade with the enemy, too, may be treasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Such traffic, if not always treason, is generally a high misdemeanor, at least it subjects the party engaged in it, to a forfeiture of the vessel and cargo, or other property that may be employed in it, unless it be carried on with the consent of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>This seems to be a principle of universal law, and not peculiar to the jurisprudence of any <num value="1">one</num> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>So inflexible is the rule, that in a case where a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has purchased a quantity of <name>British</name> goods, within the <rs>British</rs> territory, a long time previous to the declaration of hostilities, and had deposited them in an island near the frontier, a vessel hired by him to bring away the goods was captured with the cargo, and condemned as prize of war, by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Courts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> To send to the enemy munitions of war, or provisions or supplies of any kind which would enable him to carry on the war more effectually, would be an act of treason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> <q>&#x0022;All contracts with the enemy,&#x0022;</q> says Phillimon, <q>&#x0022;are null and void; even the insurance of an enemy's property is illegal, upon the ground of its being a species of intercourse with the enemy; for the same reason bills of exchange, made by the subject of <num value="1">one</num> belligerent upon the subject of the other belligerent, are illegal and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The remission of funds in money or bills to subjects of the enemy, the purchase of bills or the deposit of funds in the enemy's country, are unlawful, because they tend to improve the resources and strengthen the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>In fine, every communication with the <rs>State</rs>, however circuitous, is prohibited, unless it be sanctioned by the special authority of the <rs>Government</rs>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> As to the persons who may be guilty of treason, they are not merely the native inhabitants, nor even the citizens of a country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> Strangers and foreigners who have their domicil there may incur the guilt of treason against the country in which they dwell, by committing such acts as would be treason in a citizen or subject of this country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> As to the testimony upon which a presentment may be made, or an indictment formed, you should be satisfied by it, so far as it goes, that the charges contained in the indictment are true &mdash; that is to say, the evidence should be sufficient to create a belief that the statements in the presentment or indictment are true, upon the supposition that there is no further evidence behind to contradict or re-but it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> You should decide the case upon the evidence before you, as if that were all the testimony on either side; and when we remember that evidence is sent to you on the par of the prosecution alone, it is not going too <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> far to say that the evidence ought to be such as would, it standing alone, be sufficient to warrant a belief that the party accused is guilty. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> The <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> provides, as you have already heard, that <q>&#x0022;no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of <num value="2">two</num> witnesses to the same overt act; or on confession in open court.&#x0022;</q> But although <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> witnesses are necessary in such a case to justify a conviction, only <num value="1">one</num> is necessary to the finding of an indictment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> In all cases of treason, however, as in every other case, the evidence before you must be legal evidence, and such as would be allowed to go to a petty, or traverse jury. </p>

<head>Voluntary chaplains.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi>--In your issue of the <date value="11">11th</date> instant appeared <q>&#x0022;a plea for chaplains,&#x0022;</q> the manifest design of which was to secure higher salaries for the chaplains employed by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>I shall make no comment on the ground of the plea &mdash; the baptism of a dying man; but I would fain hope that our Government will not increase the pay of chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/><measure n="50dollars" type="currency">Fifty dollars</measure> per month is enough for any chaplain who has the patriotism that is demanded by the present war, and is willing to economise for the good of the country and the rights of the tax-payer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>While so many are ready to prey on the <rs>Confederate</rs> treasury, let the ministers of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00282" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> set an example of self-denial, by being contented with the present salaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>If the <rs>Government</rs> allowance <q>&#x0022;is below a living salary,&#x0022;</q> if the chaplain is the man whom the soldiers like and want, they will contribute something extra to his support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/> In fact there is no necessity for any paid chaplains for this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The pastors of the different churches have voluntarily agreed to attend to the hospitals and camps about the city without fee or reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>This looks like patriotism that may and doubtless will be copied by other cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>This arrangement, moreover, will enable the different denominations to have the services of ministers of their own persuasions, which the pious sick always desire; and the pastors are cheerful in the offer of these labors of love without further pay than that they receive from their own churches and congregations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>The writer of this article has no salary from any source, and yet he has officiated willingly in his ministerial office at the hospitals, without pay, whenever called upon, ever since the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>He is willing to continue to do so on the same terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/> I hope again, therefore, that our wise Government will keep the salaries of their chaplains at their present amounts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>There are men enough, and good men too, that can be had for that figure; and, I repeat, that something is due from the patriotism of chaplains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Put up the salaries to <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> and the <rs>Government</rs> will be as much annoyed by preachers in black as it is for office in the secular departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>These are times that try men's souls, and let the preachers bear their part without looking to see if there is a dollar in prospect for labor done. </p>
