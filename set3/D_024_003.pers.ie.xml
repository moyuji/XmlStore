<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Their clothing even, was superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>As for their utility, that was not clearly apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>For the purpose of holding together this organization of <num value="600">six hundred</num> negroes, nearly an equal number of white soldiers was required to discipline and guard them in their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>They were too treacherous to place on picket or guard duty, and too indolent to cultivate the deserted plantations; nor were they permitted to perform fatigue duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/><num value="1">One</num> morning <num value="40">forty</num> negroes from the black brigade were employed on fatigue duty at the dock in unloading vessels; but, it coming to the knowledge of <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, the quartermaster was ordered to relieve them from work and send them back to their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> When the exigencies of the service requires arduous work to be performed at night the slumbers of the negro are never disturbed.--During the heat of the day he ceases labor, but the white man works on. The effect of this ill-judged policy, this undue elevation of an interior race, has been to make the negro insolent and overbearing to a degree unendurable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>And <num value="1">one</num> day a white soldier struck a negro in a scuffle brought on by the insolence of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The affair took place near <placeName><persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, and within the observation of that individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Down he rushed to the beach, bare-headed, in shirt sleeves and slippers, and actually &#x0022;pitched into&#x0022; the white soldier, and the <num value="2">two</num> had a rough and tumble fight about the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>While <persName n="Sexton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Sexton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sexton</surname></persName> is said to have remarked, in the presence of several privates and non-commissioned officers, that &#x0022;he thought more of a negro which stole than he did of an honest <num value="1">one</num>; and if he had the power he would put a rifle in their hands, and let them steal from every white man they could; and unless we arm the negroes the <rs>Union</rs> cannot exist.&#x0022; A case is also cited in which a negro confessed to having stolen a sum of money from the <rs>Captain</rs> of a transport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The money was restored, but <persName n="Sexton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Sexton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sexton</surname></persName> afterwards ordered it to be given back to the negro, we presume that his thieving propensities might be encouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Through the effect of such treatment the white soldiers have been several times on the point of an outbreak; and it is by no means improbable that such an event may yet occur if <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sexton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Sexton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Sexton</surname></persName> remain long in command. </p>

So far as we can ascertain, in both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> the negro deprecates interference with his condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>He is averse to being made the subject of the war. The slave finds his way into the <rs>Federal</rs> camps only when deserted by his master; and in no <num value="1">one</num> instance have these refugees voluntarily lent aid to those whose protection they have sought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>In many cases they have carried back important information to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The negro of the <rs>North</rs> has no wish to fight in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Nor does he wish to abandon his home for a new <num value="1">one</num> in a distant land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>He simply wants to be left alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>So does the slave.--And any attempt to coerce either class into a condition for which they have shown no desire has proved, and will prove, a delusion and a snare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The record of the <rs>Northern Abolitionists</rs> contains little to approve of, and much to condemn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>They brought about this war ostensibly for improving the condition of the blacks, and giving them their freedom, and the best they can do is to propose an emigration scheme to get them out of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>On the other hand, by their united and persistent efforts they have succeeded in separating for years, at least, the <num value="2">two</num> great natural divisions of the country; they have bathed the land in blood; brought sorrow into many a household; transformed a free country into a despotism which has no parallel; squandered recklessly untold <num value="1000000">millions</num> of money; and now there remains but the last act in the drama to be enacted &mdash; the freeing of the blacks by the force of arms, the destruction of the <rs>South</rs> by murder and pillage, and the throwing of <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of shiftless creatures upon the <rs>North</rs> for support.
