<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>It was framed for times of war and peace &mdash; for all emergencies &mdash; and if fairly administered, it was sufficient for all and fit for all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>He desired to vote for some law authorizing the suspension of the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> in certain extreme cases, but he could not vote for the bill before the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Hence he had introduced a bill more guarded than that of the committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>So the motion to strike out did not prevail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/> The Chair decided that the vote sustaining the call of the previous question covered the engrossment of the bill, which cut off amendments.
