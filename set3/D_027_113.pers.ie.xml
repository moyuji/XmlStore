<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The mud has laid an embargo on all field operations, even if the chiefs of either of the hostile armies desired to attempt any offensive movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Even the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap cannonade was not heard in the city on yesterday morning, though it may have been going on. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> We have forborne to take away part in the discussions relative to the making soldiers of our slaves because it had not yet been formally proposed as a practical question, and we had hoped that it would be passed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>We did not wish to create a breach at a time when harmony is so desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>As the discussion is to be forced upon us, however, we wish to express our opposition, and the grounds thereof, in as few words as we can. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> The proposition, in the first place, is totally unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We parted from the Old Government because of its determined purpose to interfere in the domestic affairs of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Were we still under that Government, engaged in a war with all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and invaded by a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, surely nobody will contend that the <rs>General Government</rs> should possess the power, under the pretext of <unclear>nety,</unclear> to abolish slavery in the <name>States</name> by making <unclear>rs</unclear> of the slaves; for such is the undoubted effect of that measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Now, we are not aware that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has any powers which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> had not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Let it be conceded that the constitutional power exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The exercise of it is, nevertheless a confession of weakness, or rather a <hi rend="italics">profession </hi> <unclear></unclear> of a weakness which does not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>We have no occasion to resort to any such extreme measure.--Our affairs are in a better condition, and our prospects brighter, than they ever have been since the commencement of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Armies must be fed, and in order to feed them, crops must be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The negroes are our agricultural laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Take them from farmwork, and you destroy the army more effectually than <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> can do it with a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men to back <unclear></unclear> he has in the field. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It would be a powerful stimulant to recruiting for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>There can be no doubt that a vast number would resort to them who are restrained at present by the apprehension of being forced into the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They stay at home because there are in no danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Let them see that it is as dangerous to stay as to go, and they will be pretty certain to go. For, with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, they get a high bounty for enlisting, and liberty and equality into the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The services are set before them which of the <num value="2">two</num> to choose, and there will, we <unclear></unclear> be little hesitation as to the choice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>We give up the whole question when we adopt this measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Whatever <hi rend="italics">we </hi> may be fighting <unclear></unclear> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are fighting for &#x0022;the nigger&#x0022;; that <unclear></unclear> the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>If we are <unclear> </unclear> to the same extremity, perhaps it will be <unclear></unclear> make <unclear> </unclear> of our negroes: for it seems to <unclear></unclear> about as much an act of desperation <unclear></unclear> the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>But we deny that we have come <unclear></unclear> or are likely to come to it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/> <unclear></unclear> position of the <rs>Confederate Executive</rs> to <unclear></unclear> a larger number of blacks into the public <unclear></unclear> as teamsters and laborers, cannot be <unclear>reably</unclear> objected to. There will be some division on the subject of setting free after the war such as are <unclear></unclear> by the <rs>Government</rs> for these purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It is to be hoped that the discussion of the matter <unclear></unclear> not be <unclear>ined </unclear> to an unnecessary length, and that the action of the <rs>Government</rs> will be at once <unclear></unclear> and practical. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>To such a man, <unclear></unclear> the people of the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <unclear></unclear> their lives, their liberties, their persons, and their purses, to have and to hold the same for <unclear> </unclear> <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and for so much longer as he shall <unclear></unclear> For it is plain that, if he so will it, he may <unclear></unclear> for his natural life, and transmit the sceptre to the descendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>There is nothing in the world to prevent him, should he feel so disposed, and there is no reason to think that thus disposed he will not be. It seems strange to us that he should <unclear></unclear> undescended to submit to an election at all; <unclear> </unclear> we are convinced he would never have done <unclear></unclear> he not been convinced beforehand that it <unclear></unclear> in his favor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> We are prone to believe that every nation enjoys the <unclear></unclear> proportion of freedom to which it is entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have lost their liberties, therefore, we think it self- evident that it is because they never deserved to have them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>If they are slaves, it is because they are fit for the situation.--Slaves they have been for years to all the base passions that are indicative of a profligate and degenerate race; and when nations advance to that point, the transition to material bondage costs but a single step. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> Surely, the surrender which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> made on yesterday of their liberties to the <rs>Jack Pudding</rs>, <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, is in its way the most remarkable event of which history makes mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Surely, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, if not the greatest, is, at least, the meet interesting of all existing nations. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
