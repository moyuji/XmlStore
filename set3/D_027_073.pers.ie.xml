<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Yea, sir, he has gone farther &mdash; he has disregarded the expressed wishes, put aside the written directions of the <rs>President</rs> as to the disposition and control of these cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This I say &#x0022; more in sorrow than in anger.&#x0022; His statement here in court in explanation of his failure to adopt the suggestions and act in accordance with the directions of the <rs>President</rs>, I regret as much as I do the non-compliance itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I am sure the <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable-Secretary">Honorable Secretary</rs> did not intend &mdash; what might be inferred from his explanation &mdash; to put the weight of his and <persName n="Campbell,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>'s opinion as to the law in opposition to any anticipated reasoning and authorities which I might, in my poor way, adduce and offer for your consideration; much less could he have designed to forestall the judgment of this honorable court. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Be that as it may, I can only say that, however learned in the law, high in official position, and infallible in military literature, those eminent gentlemen may be, their <hi rend="italics">opinions,</hi> as now made known, are only <hi rend="italics">persuasive</hi>; they have no binding effect; they possess no inherent virtues which entitle them to that high consideration and ascertained legal measurement to which the <hi rend="italics">law, as it stands expounded, declared, illustrated, and enforced, on the pages of reported cases, binding even on this court, because they are adjudicated.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> You and I sir, here at least, know the value of the written law; <hi rend="italics">declared principles, adjudicated cases</hi>. The judgment of a competent court &mdash; well pronounced and recognised as authority &mdash; is as permanent as it is pervasive, as uniform as it is universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It yields, to no logic; it gives way before no rhetoric; it stands firm against every <hi rend="italics">outside pressure.</hi> Once recognized as a settled and adjudicated principle, it sheds its light over every other luminary, and rebukes self-interest with as much severity as it tames assumed authority with its self-sustaining vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Here, at least, the voice of law in potent, even to controlling this court, no matter what the views, the feelings, or the policy of the <rs>Government</rs> may indicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It as, then, to that tribunal I address myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>If my clients are sustained in their applications by the law, it matters not what may be the opinions of &#x0022;all comers,&#x0022; however exalted in their station and unerring in their convictions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The facts of these cases &mdash; indeed, all <num value="34">thirty-four</num>--are plain and few. They need but a simple statement to render them clear and beyond doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>My clients are Marylanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They enlisted in the military service of <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>,</hi> under a special, written, agree contract, in <num value="186.5">186&#x00BD;</num>, for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, if the war should last so long; but to be discharged sooner, if the war should be closed before the expiration of the period of their enlistment; but, at all events, to be discharged at the expiration of the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. --These were the stipulated, executed terms of their enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> assented to these terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>She afterwards turned these men, <hi rend="italics">with this contract, over to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.</hi> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> accepted them, and, along with them, this <hi rend="italics">written agreement.</hi> Here is the whole case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>And yet these men, after the expiration of the period of their enlistment, are still claimed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">secretary at War</rs> as <hi rend="italics">soldiers for the war</hi>. Can this asserted claim be sustained? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, as to the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>What I have just stated is in full proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But this is not all. It is proved that when these citizens of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> volunteered in the service of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, they then, and have always since, intended to return to <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> at the expiration of the period of their enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The act and terms of enlistment prove this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Their uniform declarations since, prove it. Their application for a discharge confirm it. But this is not all. It is in proof, by their commander, that they have all been true to their contract; that they have performed their whole duty, at all times, under all circumstances, and under every trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>They have been brave, obedient, gallant and steady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In storm and in repose, on the battle-field and in the camp, on picket and it the trenches, everywhere, they have all been faithful, brave, efficient soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Yea, more; that they are now true, loyal, high-toned, devoted friends of the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, and would have, <hi rend="italics">to a man, re-enlisted, if the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> had asked their services, for the balance of this campaign.</hi> Such are the facts as to the petitioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>How do they stand as to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>.? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> has decided that Marylanders in service may justly be considered as staying in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for an indefinite period as residents; that they have cast their lots with us and are liable to like duties, in resisting a common enemy, with our own citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>No reply being received from the <rs>President</rs>, my services were retained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>These petitions were filed after an effort on my part, in the most respectful manner, to prevent litigation, without success.--Now, these parties are here before this court, with <num value="1">one</num> other singular fact on the record, which it is proper to comment on as an important branch of the history of these cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This is to be regretted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>But, sir, the opinion of the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>, had it been given, would not have been conclusive in this court as to the law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is not here, however, and I proceed to consider the <hi rend="italics">law as I believe it to exist,</hi> with the remark that the <rs>President</rs> has, in this matter, done his whole duty to these men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> By what authority the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> arrives at the singular <hi rend="italics">decision</hi> announced, I am at a loss to know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It is not only, in my opinion, against all law in all civilized countries, but it has not (I say it with all due respect,) <hi rend="italics">the semblance of law</hi> to stand on or under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Not an elementary writer, or an unadjudicated case, that I am familiar with, countenances such a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>They all repudiate it. They all establish, or tend to establish, precisely the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The very authors referred to by my learned friend establish the converse of his proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I need not cite them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>They are too familiar to your mind to need special citation here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> my learned friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>By this rule, are the petitioners <hi rend="italics">residents.!</hi> Are they within the scope, object, or purview of the act of Congress!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is a sovereign State--afflicted, oppressed, but not subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The iron hell of oppression rests heavily on her proud, patriotic bosom.--Her sons and daughters weep over her down-trodden posture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>But, sir, the time is not far distant when <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> will rise equal to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The grasp of tyranny is not perpetual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The tread of the tyrant is not as measureless as the monotonous step of the <rs>Wandering Jew</rs>. Time, energy, caution, love of country, devotion to principle, will all conspire to loose the bonds by which she is now held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Where is there any evidence of this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>None, sir, but this voluntary contribution of my learned friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Their contract, their acts, their declarations, all prove the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>And this assumed benevolence of my learned friend, and this asserted fact of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>, are mere gratuities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>They cease to exist when contrasted with the <hi rend="italics">solid facts in the case.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> But, says my learned friend, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> complimented, and was anxious to protect, these men in his retaining order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>I can only say, save are and my chants from such complimentary protection.--As Marylanders, they enlisted; as Marylanders, <sic>they they </sic> served out the period of their enlistment; and now claim their discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Shall they be deemed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>What <hi rend="italics">says the law!</hi> Are they residents within the terms of the law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Could they be conscripted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>If so, who has a right to hold them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>I do not argue this case on the ground of my clients being <hi rend="italics">Marylanders</hi>. That is not the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Suppose they were all <hi rend="italics"><persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName></hi> subjects, enlisted as now for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, what court would refuse their discharge?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The law books say not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> But, says my learned friend, these men are only restive under military restraint; they want a holiday. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Indeed? Sir, when were they restive under the fire of the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>When were they eager to escape military restraint in the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>?--Where were they, or any of them, when the cannon balls flew thick and fast, and death claimed almost every <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>If we are not laboring under a misapprehension, the majority cast against him at the polls was very nearly <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>We want no better evidence than this to prove that what the <rs>Southern</rs> people have always stated is true, viz; that, at the <rs>North</rs>, politicians and people alike disregard the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and are, in fact, in the majority of instances, actually ignorant of its contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Here is a man who has been the editor of a political paper for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>; who has several times been elected to Congress; who was once the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Governor">Lieutenant-Governor</rs> of his State, and who is all-powerful with the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>, roundly maintaining that a President is elected by a majority of the <hi rend="italics">people,</hi> and teaching the same doctrine to his disciples, who hang upon his words as though they were the oracles of inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>For them it is, doubtless, a very comfortable doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The inference from it makes them all-powerful in the <rs>Union</rs>, and rendered it impossible for the <rs>South</rs> to continue longer in association with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>That protection is withdrawn as soon as the election is made to depend upon a majority of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> This, it seems, in the opinion of the &#x0022;little villain,&#x0022; is not a great war. It is merely an attempt of a minority, with arms in their hands, to prevent the majority from electing and flourishing under a President of their own. It is, in his eyes, merely an &#x0022;affair of the sections;&#x0022; an outbreak of discontent on the part of a few over- heated zealots; an unlawful gathering, such as his friend <persName><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.
