<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>But a very few weeks before the ordinance of secession was passed, he addressed a large assemblage of citizens, at the old <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs> club-house, upon this subject, in strains of eloquence and almost of prophecy, deprecating what he considered the mad folly of the secessionists, who, he said, were running themselves and dragging others into danger of the extent and intensity of which they had formed no rational estimate; for, said he, they have no conception of the <hi rend="italics">power</hi> which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can put forth, when necessary, for the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>.
