<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The battle of <address><street n="Bampton Roads">Bampton Roads</street></address>.<lb/>[from the <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia Inquirer</orgName>, <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num>.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> <q>&#x0022;The long expected <term n="CS steamer">rebel steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs> has at length made her appearance.&#x0022;</q> This is the initial sentence of the <rs>Associated Press</rs> dispatch announcing the disastrous rain of the <rs>Merrimac</rs> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The formidable rebel was <q>&#x0022;long expected,&#x0022;</q> and yet not the slightest competent preparation seems to have been made to resist her approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>On the contrary, <num value="2">two</num> wooden vessels, and sailing vessels at that, were left wholly at her mercy--<num value="1">one</num> of them, it is reported, without a crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>When everything should have been in readiness for a sudden and fierce onslaught by a mail-clad steamer, and all such dead wood as sailing vessels should have been cleared out of the way, we find, instead, a state of unreadiness and blind confidence of safety, and the unfortunate <rs>Corgress</rs> and <rs>Cumberland</rs> so situated as to invite their sad fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>As far as we have intelligence, the sacrifice of brave men on these <num value="2">two</num> vessels in almost or quite as great and equally deplorable as at <placeName reg="Ball's Bluff">Ball's Bluff</placeName>, which the scene at <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> calls <unclear>mentably</unclear> to mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Who is to blame?--That is the angry question that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and Monday rose instinctively to every lip. While no <num value="1">one</num> was sufficiently informed to answer the question, the old distrust of the management of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> was actively revived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> It was argued that, with such ample notice as the entire public of the <rs>North</rs> has had of the completion of so formidable an engine of naval warfare as the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, there should have been full preparation by the <name>Department</name> to meet her, and to keep, all helpless sailing vessels beyond her reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>And it was again argued that there was no reason to expect much foresight from a Department shown to be blundering and improvident by the <rs>Van Wych</rs> report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The strong desire for a change in that Department, so freely expressed some months ago, has thus become as active as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>To nothing but the opportune arrival of the <rs>Monitor</rs> are we indebted for escape from the loss of the entre fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Who is to blame? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> This event is, however, not without its valuable lessons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is demonstrated that the day of war vessels propelled by sails is at an end. Wherever they are in service on the coast, they exist only by a sort of sufferance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The moment <num value="1">one</num> of these rade railroad ironctad steamers, which the rebels have had the enterprise to build, can escape the sleepy blockade, all such fine old time-lumber will be sacrificed <unclear></unclear> the <rs>Congress</rs> and the <rs>Cumberland</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>These latter are as helpless in such case as an infant in the grasp of a giant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The little <rs>John Smith</rs>, which plies between <address><street n="Chesnut street">Chesnut street</street></address> wharf and the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, would be of more service, or at least have better chance of escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> other point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The Monitor, which refrieved the fortunes of the day in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, and upheld the honor of the old flag by beating off the powerful <rs>Merrimac</rs>, was built in <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure> from the date of the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Congress has been nearly that long in session, so that if that body had gone promptly to work in the construction of a mail-clad fleet in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> weeks of the session, as it should have done, we would by this time be almost ready to station <num value="1">one</num> at every point of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But the bill appropriating the money for this purpose lingered for weeks in the <name>Senate</name>, because <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> were reluctant to entrust the expenditure of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> involved to the hands which had already so lamentably blundered the purchases for the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Why should such a state of affairs be permitted to continue?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This is not a time for want of harmony or lack of confidence, or the absence of hearty co-operation between the several branches of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There should be a clearing out, at once, of the dead wood of the navy and of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName>. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> No definite facts have been ascertained in regard to the <hi rend="italics">terrs incognita</hi> of <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, and opinions concerning it are divided in circles of the highest authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Some assert that the enemy has drawn his wings into closer connection with the centre, while others assert that a panic has pervaded the whole army, that has so long sat in impudent deflance in front of the <rs>Capital</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> In the deserted fortifications the huge guns are overthrown as far as was possible in the hasty flight of the rebels, while military stores and ammunition are strewn about.--There is no doubt, however, to night, that, as far as Gentrsville is concerned, there is no evidence of the rebels occupying that position, after a careful scrutiny of the earthworks which so lately harbored them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Fears are freely expressed that the enemy will annihilate <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> as they march southward, while others predict a feint to fall with all their force on <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>These fears are considered entirely groundless, and the best reason that can be given for the grand retrograde is the refusal of their soldiers to enlist at the end of their term of service, which has been so fraught with misery and hardships. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>After firing several rounds the enemy retired without replying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Just at this moment several persons, supposed to be women, came out on the balconies of the houses, and the bank, waving white flags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> of the <rs>Ponchartrain</rs> ordered her to approach the shore, which she did cautiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>When within about <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> of the shore the supposed women, with other Federals, commenced a very brisk fire on the boat with their muskets, killing <num value="1">one</num> and wounding <num value="2">two</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> Along peace is sure to demoralize a nation; and a demoralized people always select as their representatives, judges and magistrates those least fitted to govern &mdash; those who will govern least &mdash; the lax, the indulgent, the effemirate, and the corrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Soldiers accustomed to rule, and who know best how to rule, are cast aside, and stump orators and demagogues, who flatter the mob and give license to their baseat passions, are elevated to all high places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/><q>&#x0022;The canker of a bad war and a ling peace&#x0022;</q> is in such times exhibited more glaringly among the rulers of a people than anong the masses themselves, because the rules are selected as the fittest exponents, representatives and impersonations of the prevalent debanshery, effeminacy and corruption of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>They interrupt and impede the administration of affairs, State and Federal, by speeches to Buncombe, and by prying into executive matters, about which they understand nothing, or if they did, are too numerous, too tattling, and too corrupt to be trusted with executive secrets &mdash; for divided responsibility makes all legislative bodies more or less careless and corrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Besides, executive business can only be surely or safely conducted by a single sovereign head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> Congress must, also, in the same manner, be guided, directed, and controlled by the <rs>President</rs> and his Cabinet; to promptly and cheerfully what they are required to do, and ask no impartinent questions; for so numerous a body should never be trusted with State secrets. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> War naturally suspends law and liberty, and if we are not willing to submit to the temporary sacrifice, we shall be conquered by the <rs>North</rs>, and be without law or liberty forever. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Having thus gagged the stump orators in Congress and in our State Legisatures, we must next turn our attention to our armies, where they are unfortunately almost as numerous as in our deliberative bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>In all the tide of time, except as a miraculous interposition <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, such a phenomenon was never witnessed before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>It is true, there was little <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>, and <persName><foreName>Joan</foreName></persName> of Arc, and Minerth, who were brave warriors, and needed no taching or training; but they were quite out of the ordinary course of things, and wholly <unclear></unclear> like a Confederate stump orator. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>No trained and intelligent soldier ever was, or ever will be, willing to fight under the <unclear> d</unclear> of a mere stump orator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Of all arts, the <unclear> t</unclear> of war is the most difficult to learn; and none learn it well but men of genius, who apply themselves to it in youth, and practice for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Old men, and most especially old stump orators, can learn nothing new. Far better make a boy of <num value="18">eighteen</num> a General, for he is impressionable, and learns new things readily, than attempt to make an officer of a man over <num value="45">forty-five</num>, who has had no military training. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> The incubus of demagogism, in the shape of stump orators, descended to us from the late Union, fetters our limbs, paralyzes us, and will soon ruin us, if not speedily shaken off. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> &#x0022;So that the sad conclusion, which all experience, wherever it has been tried, has fatally made good, appears to be, that Parliaments, admirable as advisory bodies, and likely to be in future universally useful in that capacity, are, as rulling or sovereign bodies, not useful, but useless or worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>That a sovereign, with <num value="900">nine hundred</num> or <num value="658">six hundred and fifty-eight</num> heads, all set to talk against each other, in the presence of <num value="34">thirty-four</num> or <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>, or <num value="18000000">eighteen millions</num>, cannot do the work of sovereignty at all, but is smitten with eternal incompetence for that function by the law of nature itselt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Such, alast is the sad conclusion; and in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and wherever else it is tried, a sad experience will rapidly make it good. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/> The <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName></hi> yesterday consumed nearly the whole of the time of their open session in the consideration of the <name>Senate</name> bill regulating the pay and mileage of members, and went into secret session without coming to a vote upon the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>The amendments offered to the various sections of the bill were almost innumerable, and the speeches made upon these more numerous still, and in character from sedate to ludicrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>It is a little unfortunate, we think, that members should, at this period of the session, and in this hour of the country's peril, devote themselves to legislation pertaining to their own comfort and convenience, rather than to the mighty issues which, to an outsider, <unclear></unclear> to demand their consideration.
