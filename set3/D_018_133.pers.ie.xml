<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>As to coercion, that is impossible, for: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> It would fail it attempted, and would never be attempted, unless madness ruled the hour, wild passion waged, when reason ought to govern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>But now would we stand it we should attempt to rule by force <num value="5">five</num> States of this confederacy, who declared our government over them to be a tyranny, and claimed the most of governing themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Is it not the great <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> principle, that legitimate government rests on the will or the governed?--Was it not in behalf of the sacred right of self-government that we appealed to the world for sympathy and assistance in our struggle for independent!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Is this General Government to play the very part towards some of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> themselves which was taken toward us by the <rs>British Government</rs> under <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> <unclear></unclear> Is this General Government <unclear></unclear> to resort to the <rs>British</rs> statutes to <unclear></unclear> after the <orgName n="Boston Post" type="newspaper">Boston Post</orgName> Bill, and other effective measures used against us in our struggle for self-government, as precedents of the <unclear></unclear> to be affected against some of our State, who are engaged in asserting that same right for which we all contended then it would, indeed, be an instance as ruinous as it was <unclear></unclear>, of the instability of human opinion and of the mutability of man, <unclear></unclear> portion of the old <num value="13">thirteen</num> States should be found unsecuring the port calamary, of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for modes of the engines of oppression and coercion, and send them against another part of the <name>States</name> which constituted the glorious old Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But, in my opinion, there is no fighting power in the government of the twin <unclear></unclear> States to coerce a return to the <rs>Union</rs>, If States acting in their sovereign capacity and seceded from it. They could not defile such a power from either the law of nature or the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The Convention which framed that instrument refused to give the power to coerce a State to the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The very nature of the compact of government into which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> entered implies the right, I believe, to secede from the <rs>Union</rs> which it formed, when the conditions and obligations upon which it was made have been <unclear></unclear> and <unclear></unclear>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The right of secession is argued at length, and this conclusion drawn: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> For all the reasons which I have given, and for others not now enumerated, I believe that each State, acting in its sovereign capacity, has a political right to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, when it believes that there has been a palpable and dangerous infraction of the <rs>Constitution</rs> or compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But whilst I recognize its right to judge for itself, I am also of opinion that the act is morally justifiable only when the infraction is of such a character as to make secession the only remedy, or when the danger of such an infraction is so imminent that secession must be <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi> to be a remedy at all. Therefore it is that when I was questioned during the recent canvass to know whether I would regard the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, by constitutional means, as a just cause for secession,<unclear></unclear> that for such a cause I would not added <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to secede, but that if any State did them it just cause, and for that reason secede from the <rs>Union</rs> I hold that she had a right thus to act, without question from me, and that there was no rightful authority anywhere to force her back within the jurisdiction of the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In the case of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, where, is a voter and a citizen, I have a right to speak, I would say, that although such an <unclear></unclear>, in my opinion, affords just cause for serious apprehension, and makes it prudent to prepare the means of self defence, in case of the worst results, still, I would not desire to break up this Union, without at least an honest effort to preserve it, upon terms consistent with the rights and the safety of the <rs>South</rs>.--To preserve the <hi rend="italics">Union</hi> of the <hi rend="italics">Constitution</hi> I would be willing, I trust, to make any personal sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I therefore desire and advocate conference amongst the <rs>Southern Sales</rs> to <unclear></unclear> and agree upon such guarantees as in their opinion will secure their equality and their rights within the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The position of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in case of a dissolution of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> next occupies his attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He says: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The question, then, for the border slaveholding States will be, not whether the <rs>Southern States</rs> would have been safe it all had remained in the <rs>Union</rs>, but to which division of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> they ought to attach themselves now that it was severed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In such an event, I have not the shadow of a doubt as to what ought to be the course of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and other Southern border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If they united with the other slave States they would confederate as equals, and with those whose population was homogenous, and whose interests were identified with their own. If they united with the <rs>North</rs> under such circumstances, they would constitute a helpless minority in association with States, whose population was not homogeneous with theirs, and whose interests would be considered as different and hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They could be treated as <hi rend="italics">inferiors</hi> by the dominant majority, and considered as having acquiesced in that position by the choice which they had made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> In the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> they would find an outlet for their surplus population of slaves, not only in these co-States, but in whatever territory might be acquired by that Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Under that Government, too, they would find effectual protection for their property and institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In the other Confederacy their slave population would indeed be &#x0022;penned in&#x0022; and &#x0022;localized&#x0022; within their own borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The dominant party in the <rs>North</rs> looks to this object as the cardinal principle of their association, and they would be sole to pursue that end without the show of an opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This negro population would then be penned up, not only by restrictions from the <rs>Northern</rs> majority, but by restrictions from the neighboring slave States also, who would probably hold it to be to their interest to force the border States to hold on to their slaves, not only for political reasons, but also from a desire to interpose an obstacle to the escape of their fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>What then, would be the position of the slaveholding States in the <rs>Northern Confederacy</rs> ? As their slave population increased, there would be a tendency to a fall in wage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The white laborer, by emigration, could better his condition by removing where his labor was more productive; but the slave, by the circumstances of his position, must remain and work for the home rate of wages, whatever it might be. In this state of things, the white laborer would emigrate where he could work on better terms, and the slave would remain to increase his hold upon these States, and to become the governing element of their population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Whilst the new territory of this Northern Confederacy would be given to the white man, according to their theory, the old territory of the border slaveholding States would be given to the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The consequences of such a process would soon reduce to such an extent the number of whites in these States that they would lose their only, but slender, means of defence, which they had enjoyed through the little political strength with which they had entered that Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Indeed, how long would it be before the non-slaveholding States would increase to the mark requisite to enable them to abolish slavery within the <name>States</name> by a constitutional amendment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Would they wait for that process if they did not know it to be both rapid and sure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>With the principles and feelings of this sectional party &mdash; which would wield the power of that Confederacy &mdash; how long would the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> endure in the <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> slaveholding States which were attached to that Union?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Is there <num value="1">one</num> of the slaveholding States which would voluntarily incur such a risk, with the fate of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">British West Indies</placeName> before their eyes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In a Union with a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> they should encounter none of these dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In that connection the slave population operates us a safety-valve to protect the white laborer against an unreasonable or ruinous decline in the rate wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>With an outlet for emigration, the slave is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to move under a decline in the rate of wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The law of profit moves him to a theatre where he will earn more for his master, and yet more for himself, whilst the labor market which he leaves is thus gradually relieved from the pressure, and the white man remains in the land of his birth to enjoy the profits of remunerating operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>As a proof of the truth of this view, I ask if the average rate of wages of the white laborer of the <rs>South</rs> is not higher than in any other settled portion of the globe? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> In conclusion he says: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> When the future which lies before us is so clouded by gloom and uncertainty, we all must feel that the time has come for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to put her house in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>No man end now tell what a day or an hour may bring forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>An accident might fire a train, whose explosion would part the <rs>Union</rs> asunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But, be the issue what it may.--peace or war!--and no man <unclear></unclear> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> desires the former more earnestly than I do &mdash; may the noble old Common wealth be prepared to play the part that becomes her. Certain I am that I speak the common voice of nearly all her sons, when I say that, where she leads we will follow; and should she in her sovereign capacity throw her banger to the breeze, we will rely to it as the emblem of our allegiance, whether it bears upon its folds a single star, as the representation of her undivided sovereignty, or a whole constellation to mark the numbers of a confederated system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>When she speaks, her voice will be needed at home, and, I trust, respected abroad. </p> </q><bibl n="letter from Senator Hunter"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> Such, fellow-citizens is a meagre outline only often pictures of wrong and outrage that we are expected to endure unresistingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But shall we endure Heaven forbid!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Forbid it the memory and example of those noble patriots who pledged their &#x0027;lives their fortunes and their sacred honors&#x0027; to maintain their liberty and their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Shall we, the descendants of such a sires, relinquish the rich inheritance thus acquired &mdash; Must we jeopard our present security and our future existence as a free people, by stopping now to re-argue the abstract question of the right of secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The former being <hi rend="italics">subjects,</hi> could not withdraw from or forcibly oppose their government without an act of rebellion; for, although they declared it their right to change their government, the were fully aware that the right depended upon their success in maintaining it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>And more than this &mdash; a palpable infraction by <num value="1">one</num> or more of the other States of the covenanted rights of <num value="1">one</num> or more of the others, releases the letter from their obligations to the compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>And of such infractions and the made and measures of redress, each State has the right to judge for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This is a right inherent in States, and can only be alienated by their voluntary act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>I shall tell the tale as it was told to me, professing to have no knowledge about the dignity of hearsay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> It appears that <num value="1">one</num> day last week, a negro man belonging to <persName n="Tredway,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Tredway,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Tredway</surname></persName>, who lives a few miles above <placeName reg="Goochland Court-House">Goochland Court-House</placeName>, came to his master and told him that he had overheard a conversation between a negro belonging to <persName n="Turner,Mister,George,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="default:Turner,George,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>, and a woman belonging to <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> T., whom the negro in question had for a wife, in which the husband revealed a plot between <num value="2">two</num> other negroes of <persName n="Turner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="nearbymention:Turner,George,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>, and a white man named <persName n="Drumright,,De,Grasse,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="default:Drumright,De,Grasse,,"><foreName>De</foreName> <foreName>Grasse</foreName> <surname>Drumright</surname></persName>, (or, as the neighbors call him, Grassy Drumlight,) to murder <persName n="Turner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="nearbymention:Turner,George,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It seems Mr. T. had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 31" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> for the purpose of selling a crop of wheat or tobacco, and that the conspirators suspected he would return with all the money upon his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>They were to waylay him on his way from <placeName key="tgn,2229509;tgn,2229482" n="0.237 000000.7107	placename;tgn,2229509;Cedar Point, Goochland, Virginia,Goochland,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.198 000000.5950	placename;tgn,2229482;cedar point, onslow, north carolina,Onslow,North Carolina,United States,North and Central America" reg="Cedar Point, Goochland, Virginia,Goochland,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;cedar point, onslow, north carolina,Onslow,North Carolina,United States,North and Central America">Cedar Point</placeName>, where they knew he would get out of the boat, murder him, plunder him, and bury him in a grave, which they had prepared for him in a spot so secluded and so sheltered from observation by a thick and almost impenetrable growth of brush wood extending for a long distance on every side around, that his remains might chance never to be discovered until the sounding of the last trumpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>As the negro who told this story bore a very bad character, <persName n="Tredway,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Tredway,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Tredway</surname></persName> refused to listen to it, until he told him that if he either would secrete himself, or cause some <num value="1">one</num> else to be secreted in a certain tobacco house, he would bring the negro who had revealed the plot to his wife within earshot of the place, and there induce him to go over the whole scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/><persName n="Tredway,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Tredway,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Tredway</surname></persName> thought it best to follow but this suggestion, although he did not expect anything important to result from it. He accordingly placed <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen in ambush in the tobacco house, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> told the informer to proceed as he had proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>At the appointed time, both negroes came to the rendezvous.--<rs type="role">Dr.</rs> T. S. negro then asked the other some questions about the intended murder and robbery; the latter denied all knowledge of any such design; the former told him dental was useless, since he had overheard his revelation to his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Being thus pressed, the accused negro came out, confessed his knowledge, and detailed the scheme as I have given it above.--Upon searching, the grave was discovered, the <num value="2">two</num> plotting negroes were sent to jail, and Drumlight fled, but was arrested in the lower part of the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>There was no evidence but that of the negroes against him, and he was consequently discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The accused negroes are in jail awaiting trial. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> I observe the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> has taken up the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>' slander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Is it not remarkable that all the taunts of the press have not been able to make the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> break silence on that subject?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>I should suppose that the article of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> would have made a dumb man open his mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It was so erect, so personal, so bitter, that I cannot conceive how the <hi rend="italics">Times'</hi> man could have held his peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Verity, dignitaries, in that part of the world, must have a strange idea of what is right and becoming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>It surely is the part of a gentleman, when he discovers that he has been the means of inflicting an injustice, to make all the reparation in his power, and it was to have been presumed, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">prima facis,</foreign></hi> that a member of Congress was a gentleman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Presumption, however, if it ever arrived at any such hasty conclusion, must evidently have been very far in the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It is plain enough that at least <num value="1">one</num> man has had, in his life, the right to have &#x0022;honorable&#x0022; written before his name without having a spark of honor on him. I have no doubt he sent his reporter to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 31" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> with instructions to <unclear> </unclear> most lying libel he could concoct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It was his cue then to traduce, vilify, and belittle everything South of <unclear>M son's</unclear>and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s. His tone seems to have <unclear></unclear> down wonderfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Apparently, he is a little alarmed at the storm he has been trying so long to raise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Nothing can be milder or more conciliatory than the general tenor of his paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Even in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, his reporters find something not altogether odious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>I have a No of his paper now before me, in which <num value="1">one</num> of these reporters regrets the excesses into which fanaticism has hurried the <rs>North</rs>, and does not appear to wonder at the <rs>South</rs> for becoming thoroughly alarmed, and making the most determined preparations for resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Really, I think if the <rs>Prince</rs> of Wale were once more to visit <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 31" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, a <hi rend="italics">Times'</hi> reporter would not discover so much that was odious in his reception. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> By the bye, a very remarkable circumstance, in connection with this subject, seems to have escaped your observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The correspondent of the &#x0022;sure enough&#x0022; <hi rend="italics">Times</hi>.--the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, not its <unclear></unclear> in New York.--dates from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, where he says the <rs>Prince</rs> as just arrived by way of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Her men-of-war easily sunk the wretched junks that attempted to oppose their advance, and her troops quite as easily dispersed the <name>Chinese</name> forces armed with matchlocks or bows and arrows, many of whom threw somersets and uttered terrible yells, helping, in their semi-barbarian ignorance, to frighten them from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The <name>English</name> troops could afford to laugh at their antics, and to boast that they &#x0022;shot them flying&#x0022; Just as easily, a few years ago, in company with the <rs>French</rs>, they again inflicted a severe chastisement upon the same foe. But since the seat of war has been removed into the <rs>Northern</rs> provinces, they have encountered a very different kind of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>With weapons every way unequal, without discipline, and without even the stimulant of hope to keep up their spirits, they fought to the last extremity.--When at last compelled to retreat, they left the ground strewed with their own bodies and those of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>It seems evident to us that they do not mean to give up their capital without a desperate resistance.--It is almost impossible, nevertheless, that they should eventually succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>What then!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>This is scarcely the beginning of what they will yet have to encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>It is a lesson which they will not be apt to forget, and the consequences may yet be of the most serious character.
