<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>So well, too, have they succeeded, that the relief officer, appointed by the county court, informs me that he has had no application for assistance from our neighborhood since the society was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>I will give you their plan of operating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Through the kind offices of <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen of the neighborhood, they procure from the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, garments already cut out, and meeting every <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, they distribute the work among the families of the soldiers, to be made up by the next <rs>Saturday</rs>; when; being passed by our inspecting Committee, they pay the same prices obtained at the department in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>They have thus distributed from <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">$25</measure> to <measure n="35dollars" type="currency">$35</measure> per week, which you will say is efficient service in the right direction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> By this plan the defenceless and dependent are supplied &mdash; not by charity, but by the reward of labor, which is much better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Nor are the members of the society unemployed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Their skillful hands labor too upon these same garments, and their earnings and fines for absence constitute a fund to be best owed as their united wisdom may direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Donations of wool have also been obtained, and, as speedily as possible, transformed into socks for the soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> Nor have our generous and patriotic young ladies been satisfied with these efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>They gave on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th</day></dateStruct>, an exhibit on of tableaux and charades, which gave great satisfaction to the audience, and in the judgment of all present was a decided success, while at the door nearly <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">$40</measure> rewarded their efforts for the same glorious cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>None of them had ever appeared before, and but few had seen such exhibitions; and yet: all the pieces showed ease, skill and dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>So popular was the entertainment that many not present regret their want of information, and there is a strong demand for its repetition, which I understand will be gratified.--Thus you see that while the <q>&#x0022;upper end&#x0022;</q> is well represented in the field, the fires of patriotism burn brightly at home. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> The people are beginning to manifest their impatience for startling news in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The last great excitement, borns hither from the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, has ceased to excite interest and since the willing humiliation of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government changed the aspect of things, it has become weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Not that there is any expecial disappointment, for we are now in no worse condition than we were before, but it is no less annoying than idle to discuss the probabilities of outside assistance when each day a developments render limore doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>In fact, as the <rs>South</rs> went into this war with the expectation of having to fight her way out of it, she might as well keep her own strong arm and stone heart nerved for the conflict, hoping for nothing from abroad but the enforcement against the blockade of a principle solemnly affirmed by <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> in the treaty of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>She can deal with the <rs>North</rs> single handed, and in no instance should she permit her anergies to relax through a delusive dream of favors from quarters where she never sought them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/> This having come to be the condition of affairs, and the <rs>Southern Government</rs> showing no disposition to adopt the offensive, we see no present prospect of relief from the monotony which now prevails in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>The <q>&#x0022;grand army&#x0022;</q> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> cannot be moved towards the masked batteries and pitfalls of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and every fresh arrival from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> reports that there is no earthly chance of getting the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> out. A vague rumor of an apprehended advance upon <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> is revived, but it probably has no real foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Many anxious eyes are turned towards <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, where the inroads of the enemy have lately driven valuable and loyal citizens from their homes; and it would be gratifying to hear of prompt measures to prevent further outrage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/> The telegraph brings some news from the coast, where, it seems, the <name>South Carolinas</name> have successfully repulsed an advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>We hear that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

A cannonade is reported at <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, as will be seen by reference to the telegraph column. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/> With these slight exceptions, we are becalmed, as it were, in the very height of the tempest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The public mind, however, is restless, and anxious to be relieved by some decisive action that shall have a positive influence in the progress of the war; but present indications reveal nothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/> Since the foregoing was written we have received a report that a private dispatch was received on yesterday from <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, by a prominent military officer now in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, in which it was stated that the indications point to a Federal attack, at an early day, on <placeName reg="Evansport, Defiance, Ohio" key="tgn,2079480">Evansport</placeName>, and the probability was that a simultaneous attack would be made on other points on the <rs>Potomac</rs>. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> Several communications have been published in your columns recently, describing the battle at <placeName reg="Drainsville">Drainsville</placeName>, but hone of these contributors have been explicit enough to describe the positions and conduct of the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> in that engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>We do not wish to claim for the <orgName type="regiment" key="6SCRegiment">6th South Carolina regiment</orgName> any unmerited honor, but desire simply to place her position and conduct fairly before the public, and to correct some erroneous statements previously made with reference to the loss she sustained in the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>A writer was professes to have been with the <rs>Kentucky</rs> regiment during the engagement states that our <unclear></unclear> loss was fully too, and that the killed and wounded in that regiment was half that amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The same writer afterwards states the loss of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6SCRegiment">6th South Carolina regiment</orgName> to be <num value="15">15</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Whence he obtained this information we are at a loss to know, her refer the readers of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> to the report of the killed and wounded of the difference regiments published in the <orgName n="Richmond Papers" type="newspaper">Richmond papers</orgName>, and at once they will ascertain the loss of the <orgName type="regiment" key="SC6">6th South Carolina</orgName> to be <num value="65">65</num>, which from the small number of men in the regiment, <num value="515">515</num>, was much heavier than that of any other regiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/> The positions of the regiments when drawn up in line of battle have been of finitely and correctly seated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> But the most heartrending scene that presented itself resulted on the part of <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckian</rs>, who, made <unclear></unclear> the brave <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> for the enemy, posted a murderous are into their range, at a distance of not more than <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/> This was enough to disconcert and discourage the bravest men, and throw into confusion the best disciplined regiment in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>But the shock, though very severe, was not sufficient to disperse the <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, white, in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> after the reception of this beauty fire, they were again in line of battle proper, and bravely advanced on the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were lying in ambush, and when the advancing column had proceeded within <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> of their line, they opened a terrific fire upon it, which was returned in a manner creditably and honorably to the regiment and the brave soldiers of the <rs>Palmetto State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Never were soldier exposed to a more deadly volley, and never are men stand more nobly to their posts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> When completely overpowered by numbers, and well night out-flanked on our left, we were ordered to fail back to a more advantageous position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The regiment left back in good order and reformed, and was shortly after wards withdrawn from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>The <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckian</rs> fought well on the left, the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> and Alabamians bravely on the right, but the heavy loss sustained by South Carolinains, in the centre, shows concessively that she was in the heat of the fight, and that her sufferance was as severe as any other regiment engaged. </p> <closer> <signed><placeName key="tgn,2020752" n="1.000 1" reg="palmetto, manatee, florida">Palmetto</placeName>.</signed> </closer> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
