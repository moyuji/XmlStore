<head>&#x0022;This Lamentable War.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> This expression is often uttered by persons who mean nothing by it more than the idea that it is a shocking and execrable war as carried on by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some few intend for it another meaning &mdash; a lamenting of the separation of the <rs>Union</rs> as the cause of it. The phrase is only appropriate in this latter view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The war cannot be properly lamented by those who view the cause of it justly, and who do not lament the separation from the <rs>Federal Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It is time that everybody in the <rs>South</rs> fully understood this question, and had settled their minds down upon the only just and logical conclusion from the history of the events which terminated in the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The continuation of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> was impossible upon any other terms than complete submission to the <rs>Northern States</rs>, whose preponderance in the representation in Congress and the election of <rs type="role2">President</rs>, placed in their possession the entire control of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They began at an early period to exert their influence for the purpose of shaping the policy of the country so as to centralize all power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They were resisted with only partial success by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The struggles between the <num value="2">two</num> sections had brought the <rs>Union</rs> to the verge of dissolution on several occasions, when a peace was patched up by compromises, in which the <rs>South</rs> always made concessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But the peace was only patched up. The <rs>North</rs> ever returned to the attack upon the rights and interests of the <rs>South</rs> with increased energy and increased <hi rend="italics">power.</hi> Finally, when the people of the <rs>North</rs> found that they had at last, through their numbers of voters, the power to carry all the branches of the <rs>Government</rs>, they hesitated not to usurp them all. They employed the most atrocious means, agitating the most dangerous issues with a duplicity characteristic of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Drawing that sectional line that <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> had foretold would dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>--because he knew that his people never would submit to the tyranny and ignominious rule of a sectional majority &mdash; they were ready to follow it up with the assertion of the supreme authority of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> over all the <name>States</name> as necessary to hold them together &mdash; to <hi rend="italics">bind</hi> them to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They knew their usurpations would lead to secession unless the power of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> could be made so resistless and overshadowing as to check it.--They threw off all disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Their <rs type="role2">President</rs>, elected without a solitary vote in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, holdly expounded their constitutional dogma by declaring that <hi rend="italics">States</hi> were no more to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> than <hi rend="italics">counties</hi> were to the <name>States</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He wanted to ignore the <name>States</name> altogether &mdash; to cease calling men <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, South <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, Georgians, etc., and to call them <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The system of Government established by our Revolutionary Fathers &mdash; that system which contemplated the independence and sovereignty of the municipalities &mdash; the <name>States</name>--as indispensable to public and personal liberty &mdash; was discarded and contemned as idle and ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The Federal Government was everything &mdash; the <name>States</name> nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>To have submitted to his election, his inauguration, and his rule, would have been to accept the <rs>Northern</rs> political dogma, and to have surrendered the whole power and authority of the <name>States</name>--to have sunk them into utter insignificance and contempt &mdash; to have surrendered liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It would have been to incur inferentially the execration of the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country, who considered the usurpation of the powers of the <rs>Government</rs> by a sectional majority a tyranny to which the sons of the men he knew never would submit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The slavery agitation was used by the men of the <rs>North</rs> to accomplish their object of taking possession of the <rs>Government</rs> and controlling its powers for their own benefit, and, to the detriment of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, by making them completely tributary to the aggrandizement and wealth of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Slavery is not the cause of the war. Northern hypocrisy used it only as an instrument, as a means of agitating amongst prejudiced, ignorant, and fanatical people, composing so large a part of the <rs>Northern</rs> public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It served a purpose &mdash; any other which would have answered as well would have been as acceptable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Indeed, slavery the <rs>Northern</rs> leaders know to be indispensable to the production of the very staples which yielded the great profits to Northern commerce and build up all their wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They had no idea of its ultimate extinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But as a means to agitate the public mind and establish the sectional power they <sic>scrupled</sic> not to use it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was the consummation of the war upon Southern rights and interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The destruction of State-rights and State sovereignty was indispensable to the maintenance of the sectional tyranny inaugurated <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> by his election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Resistance by the <rs>South</rs> was a matter of course, unless all semblance of manhood, of national and personal independence, had departed from her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The war followed resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It is not &#x0022;lamentable.&#x0022; Association with an unscrupulous race, who hesitated not to employ the vilest means to usurp the powers of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, who subverted the spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the terms of the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName>, in order to bind us to submit, was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The separation from them was right and just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It cannot be justly lamented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The war should be accepted as a natural and providental consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It should be met manfully and cheerfully, and there should be no regrets, no sighing for the past &mdash; that past which was steadily involving the <rs>Southern States</rs> in a condition of vassalage humiliating to a proud people and degrading them to a point beneath the respect of civilized nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The separation is just and happy for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It is a dissolution of a Government extending over an area too immense for any permanent control less arbitrary than that of a despotism, and it is a dissolution that saves the free people of the <rs>South</rs> from submission to that despotism which was fast spreading itself through the power and patronage of the <rs>Government</rs>, and which the <rs>South</rs> would, in a brief term of years, have been unable to resist! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The separation is glorious!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The war, as the price of liberty and freedom from Northern domination, is most acceptable!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>No nation ever was born without a great sacrifice of blood!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We are making this sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the reward will be worthy of the price in blood we pay for it! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> A large and influential gathering of Louisianians and <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> assembled on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> last at the <rs>Capitol</rs>; for the purpose of devising measures for the relief of the noble patriots who have sacrificed their property and incurred banishment from their homes rather than disgrace themselves by succumbing to the vile invaders of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The old and the young, the venerable matron, the patriarch tottering on the brink of the grave, the blooming maiden, the mother and her unoffending little ones, have all been ruthlessly expelled from their firesides for refusing to perjure themselves and to repudiate their fathers, husbands, and brothers, now fighting in the ranks of our patriotic armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>They are taking their places as they arrive at the proper age, and among them the skulkers are rare indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The difficulty has been to restrain them from entering the service before that age. It has made the heart ache to see hundreds of boys, whose frames had not been knitted firmly, and whose constitutions had not been formed, dying in hospital from the effects of the life they were not prepared to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The patriotic and generous emotions so difficult to restrain do not permit them to dally after the proper age, and they come gladly, with the glow of youth upon the cheek, to pour out their young blood for their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It is a cheering contemplation, though the unbidden tear springs up as we behold it, to look upon these loyal and brave boys, as their time arrives, taking their places in the line as their country's defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>This they will continue to do until the day of our deliverance.
