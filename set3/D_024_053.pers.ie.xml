<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> This is a repetition of the old game of bragg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from the beginning have been playing that game, and have been &#x0022;pulverizing the <rs>Confederacy</rs>&#x0022; till we wonder there is a whole pebble left in it from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande Whilst</rs> it would be suicidal to underrate their numerical superiority, it would be equally impolitic and preposterous to give them credit for all the pretensions to overwhelming strength which it suits them to set up.
