<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>His caissons had been taken from him, and he found it impossible to reclaim them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He endeared it in the best manner he could, and supplied the deficiency by wagons which he selected in <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and had fashioned to suit his purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>When the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack was made at <placeName key="tgn,2110370" n="1.000 10" reg="Aquia, Stafford, Virginia">Aquia</placeName>, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Walker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="nearbymention:Walker,Lindsay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName></hi> formed his company, had his guns and caissons all harnessed up, set out for the field, arrived and fired his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun in <measure n="35minutes" type="date">thirty-five minutes</measure> after he had received the order to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Such promptness we believe to be almost unexampled in the history of war. The cool, daring, imperturbable courage of the man was on that occasion a subject of admiration to all who be held the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>He was covered by no breastwork &mdash; not even a green bush was between him and the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>His battery was drawn up on the open sand-beach, and there he stood exposed for hours to the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Animated by his exampled, his men fought like heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It was ascertained, after the fight, by the report of the enemy themselves, that every shot which struck was fired by the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Purcell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="nearbymention:Purcell,John,,,"><surname>Purcell</surname></persName></hi> battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>In the report of the engagement, it was said that his guns were of too small calibre, and that his shot fell short. --This statement was, how ever, afterward corrected, as soon as the officer who wrote the report discovered the actual state of the case.--A carpenter who had been pressed on the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> to repair damages, afterward came to Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, and said that the shells had made a hole in her as large as a large window &mdash; that <num value="1">one</num> of them had gone through the upper deck, and that numbers were killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Not a casualty occurred among our men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>They were almost all stout, able-bodied young men, perfectly willing to work or fight, as occasion might require; but they felt chagrined at seeing so much labor devolved upon them, while other companies, equally interested in the success of their work, were entirely exempted. --On such occasions <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Walker,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="nearbymention:Walker,Lindsay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName></hi> was always on hand to cheer them in their tolls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He himself set the example, and I toiled like a common soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><q>&#x0022;Come, boys,&#x0022;</q> he would say, <q>&#x0022;if you are hot, throw off your coats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>If you are still hot, off with your next garment.&#x0022;</q> By encouragement like this and by always keeping in a good humor, and having a laugh and a joke ready for all emergencies, not less than by his brilliant courage, he endeared himself to his men, not <num value="1">one</num> of whom, it is believed, would desert him in the most perilous exigency that could arise from the most desperate battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/><milestone unit="column" n="4"/> His kindness to his soldiers and his attention to their wants, are, indeed, above all praise. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They arrived on the right of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="nearbymention:Walker,Lindsay,,,"><surname>Walker</surname></persName></hi> was ordered to the left, and he marched <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> to the appointed place, through a perfect storm of shell and shot, rained down upon him from the enemy's batteries, on his flanks.--To these he paid no attention whatever, but when he arrived at his destination, he saw that the enemy were on the point of retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It was then that, with characteristic modesty, he asked leave to try his &#x0022;little Derringers.&#x0022; (The Derringer is a rifled pistol, so called rom the inventor.) Leave was granted, and the fire was tremendous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>A perfect lane was opened in the enemy, who betook himself instantaneously to flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> --Your remarks in a recent number, in reference to sending supplies of clothing to our sons, our brothers, our kinsmen and our friends in the army, touched the very nerve of my judgment and feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Winter with his frosts is close by, and though <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> is beautiful and delightful to the vigorous frame in the day, it will be trying and painful to the poor soldier in the cold frosty nights if he be scantily supplied with warm clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>With it he will rise refreshed, not the poor enfeebled dejected soldier, but the bold warrior, with strong nerve and bounding heart to defend his country and those he loves and those he feels by their care love him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> How foolish we shall seem if, after shaking a continent and moving the world in defence of the right and to maintain our liberties; after raising our hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men and <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars; after gaining mighty-victories, all should be nipped in the bud for want of socks, and shirts, and blankets &mdash; all to be nipped in the bud by an early frost ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> How will the hearts of the people ache, if it is learned that, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> hence, (what is certain to be the case if the army is ill supplied,) the warm blood of the country's defenders had chilled and frozen &mdash; that in their tents, through the long nights, while the winds howled and the cold rains fell, no warm clothing was comforting them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>But, chilled and stiff, their minds looked back to the neighborhoods they had left, and saw those they left in warm houses, by crackling fires, or retiring to <rs n="feather beds" type="product">feather beds</rs> with piled covering.-- <q>&#x0022;They think not of me,&#x0022;</q> he would say, <q>&#x0022;while I perish with the cold, nor send me even a pair of woolen socks, or woolen shirts, or blankets&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The people will strip their beds rather than the supply shall be wanting, knowing they still have shelter and a fire to warm them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>We protested; but yes, we must have it; her husband was away in the army, and her heart not only cared for him, but for his comrades in the service, also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The report was found to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>There had been a chain strongly fixed in the floor of the prison, to which it had become necessary on some occasions to secure the prisoners; this chain <name>White</name>, with almost superhuman strength, had wrenched from its fastenings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It was a common-sized ox-chair, about <num value="3">three</num> feel in length, and had upon <num value="1">one</num> of its ends an iron ring nearly <measure n="9inches" type="distance">nine inches</measure> in circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>It was clear that his wicked course of life had made him familiar with the use and the effects of chloroform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Indeed, he said so, and told the officers that the article they were using was weak and poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>He evidently was acquainted with chemicals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>In order to resist its effects be wound his bed-quilt around his face, beat occasionally to the window for air, and removed a portion of the blanket by reaching out and drawing it through the grating; so as to make an opening for the admission of the wind. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>When the sheriff removed the felt cap, and was about substituting the usual white <num value="1">one</num>, the prisoner again objected, and, with fearful imprecations, declared that it should not be put on. <persName n="Black,Sheriff,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Black,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sheriff">Sheriff</roleName> <surname>Black</surname></persName>, in a decided tone, endeavored to persuade the prisoner, but in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>For nearly an hour the officers were engaged in a struggle to enforce compliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Here, indeed, was the demoniac character of the prisoner displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>He made every effort to prevent the officers from putting on the white covering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Pinioned and bound as he was, he fought with desperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>He snapped and bit at their fingers, he leaped into the air, he crouched toward the ground, and for some time it seemed doubtful whether he could be compelled to submit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> After a severe and protracted struggle the cap was thrown upon his head and securely adjusted about his face and the strings drawn around his neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Nothing now remained of the direful preparations but to put the rope around his neck and adjust the fatal noose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>With some difficulty this was at length accomplished, the united efforts of <num value="4">four</num> men being required for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>As the <rs>Sheriff</rs> drew the fatal noose closer to its place and placed the knot beneath the ear of the unhappy man, he exclaimed with-fearful imprecations, <q>&#x0022;What in hell are you choking me now for?--you are choking me, for I can hardly speak.&#x0022;</q> These are the last words of the wretched man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The occasion of this proclamation is simply what is stated in the proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/><hi rend="italics">i. e.,</hi> the failure to deliver to the <rs>President</rs>, for his signature, a bill passed by Congress authorizing him to <q>&#x0022;continue the appointments made by him in the military and naval service during the recess of Congress, or the present session, and to submit them to Congress at its next session.&#x0022;</q> This, and this only, is the cause of convening Congress to-day. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The Union--the <name>Confederation</name> and the cotton question.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> At a time when <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> was the greatest and most prosperous power upon the earth &mdash; when the sceptre of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pharaohs</hi> was acknowledged throughout the <rs>Eastern</rs> world, from the <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName> to the borders of <placeName key="tgn,7000231" n="1.000 27" reg="iran">Persia</placeName> &mdash; the prophet <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Isaiah</foreName></persName> </hi> said <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> shall be the besort of kingdoms. &#x0022;</q> It took many centuries, and the continued agency of innumerable fierce and devastating invasions &mdash; the <name>Assyrians</name>, the <rs n="Persian" type="ethnic">Persians</rs>, the <name>Greeks</name>, the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs>, the <name>Arabs</name>, the <name>Crusaders</name>, and the <name>Turks</name> &mdash; to accomplish the destiny thus foreshadowed by the prophet. --Yet it was accomplished, and <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> was <num value="1">one</num> year ago the resort of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It is, however, no longer so. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation has within that time assumed a place in the scale to which the native meanness of the <rs>Egyptian</rs> character, exaggerated and intensified by <measure n="3000years" type="date">three thousand years</measure> of uninterrupted slavery and the vices which slavery brings in its trait, was never able to reach in its progressive descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>At a single plunge it has sunk fathoms deep below the doomed and denounced kingdom of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pharaohs,</hi> and it stands forth not only as the basest of existing nations, but as the basest nation that ever existed upon the face of the earth; or, rather, perhaps we should say it has within that time shown itself to be all this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> It is to dissolve the bands that connected us with this detestable and detested people, that the present Confederation is established and the present war waged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The Southern States have for <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> been victims of the punishment prescribed by the tyrant <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="smallcaps">Mesentius</hi></foreign> to the enemies who fell in his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>They have been chained to the dead, putrid carcass of Yankeedom, and compelled to drag it along at the peril of their own existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>They have executed their hard task with infinite loathing &mdash; they have, at last, cut themselves loose &mdash; and no earthly power can over again restore the links of the broken chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Those Northern newspapers and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> correspondents, therefore, who write that the <name>Confederation</name> designs to conquer Yankeedom, and to make <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jeff,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Jeff,nomatch:0"><surname>Jeff</surname></persName>.<persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Hector,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName></hi> <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the whole country lately known as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, either lie willfully, or are wholly ignorant of the views entertained either by the <rs>Southern</rs> people or the <rs>Southern President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>They desire nothing more than to shake off the rotten carcass &mdash; to place a gulf of fire between them and the &#x0022;basest of nations&#x0022;--to render a future Union utterly and wholly impossible, henceforward forever, worlds without end. Neither as fellow-citizens of the same Republic, nor as fellow- subjects of the same monarchy, nor as a conquered race, nor as slaves, nor as tributaries, nor under any other form of connection whatever, do they desire to have any communication with them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> It is, therefore, wholly immaterial to the question of re-union, whether the cotton manufacturing interests of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> find new sources of supply or not. so repugnant is the thought of re-union to the heart of every Southern man who deserves the name, that in the whole Southern States there is not a cotton planter who would not willingly burn every bale of cotton, and forego the cultivation of it forever hereafter, were the alternative presented to him of cotton in the <rs>Union</rs> or no cotton out of it. Such papers as the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> reckon without their host when they fancy that the equanimity of the <name>Confederation</name> is at all disturbed by the efforts of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to open new channels of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The war is not a war for the sake of cotton &mdash; it is not a war for commercial interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>These are but incidental questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>It is a war of separation, final and eternal, from the infamously degraded associates to whom we have heretofore been chained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We are perfectly able to exist and to flourish, although another bale should never grow south of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s</hi> line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> It is amazing, nevertheless, to read <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> speculations upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, for instance, stealing the thunder of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, gravely tells us, upon the faith of a paragraph in the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, in obtaining her supplies hereafter, will entirely ignore the <rs>Southern States</rs>--that she will get an extra half <num value="1000000">million</num> from <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> this year, and eventually more &mdash; that she will cultivate vast quantities in <placeName key="tgn,7000490;tgn,2140674" n="0.010 000000.3296	placename;tgn,7000490;australia,Oceania;0.006 000000.1860	placename;tgn,2140674;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="australia,Oceania;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America">Australia</placeName> &mdash; that she has obtained leave to settle a colony in <placeName key="tgn,7005562" n="1.000 9" reg="nicaragua">Nicaragua</placeName>, and, in a word, that the <rs>Southern States</rs> will soon lose altogether the market for their great staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>A gloomy picture the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> draws for the <rs>Southern States</rs>, unless they repent and consent once more to return to the bosom of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName></hi>--There are, however, several little drawbacks to the perfection of this grand scheme, which it hints at, and which have to be removed, before it can command the full success to which the wisdom of its conception entitles it. For instance, in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> the cotton has to be transported hundreds of miles from the interior on the backs of men or mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>That, however, is but a small drawback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The Government is to build railroads <num value="1000">thousands</num> of miles long for the convenience of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The Government has tried heretofore to raise cotton in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It has even, on several occasions, obtained seed from <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The cotton is good the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year, but the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> it degenerates into the same inferior, almost worthless staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Nevertheless, if worked in with <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton, it will do, and if fresh seed can be obtained from <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> every year, the crop will never degenerate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The inquisitive might ask, if you go to <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> for the seed every year, why not go there at once for the cotton?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>and if <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton can be obtained to place out the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>, why can it not be obtained for the entire work?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>But curious inquiries spoil theories, and must not be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7000490;tgn,2140674" n="0.010 000000.3296	placename;tgn,7000490;australia,Oceania;0.005 000000.1612	placename;tgn,2140674;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="australia,Oceania;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America">Australia</placeName> a skeptic might hint that it would take a number of years to inaugurate the successful cultivation of cotton on a large scale, where the population is sparse and the gold mines productive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>In Nicaraguans it might be that the climate would destroy several generations of settlers before made progress was made in raising cotton, But the old <unclear>adage</unclear> &#x0022;the <unclear></unclear> may starve while the grass is growing,&#x0022; most not be quoted here, lost is endangers the theory on which all the <unclear></unclear> of Yankeedom <unclear></unclear> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> lest this war last as long as it may, <unclear></unclear> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> as peace shall have returned, and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton have been again brought into the market, it will drive out all competitors, <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> or others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Commerce, as the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> property says, looks to its own needs only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>If our cotton be the best, it will be bought, in spite of competition, and as yet we see no chance of its having even a rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Yet we cannot conclude this article better than by repeating that this is not a war for cotton nor for commercial advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It is a war of principle, and as such it will be waged by our people at any and every cost of any and every interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>We may subdue the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but it will only be to render them incapable of hurting us hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>That we can ever renew our former connexion with them, we hold to be absolutely impossible. </p> </div3>
