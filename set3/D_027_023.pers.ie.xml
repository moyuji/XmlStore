<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Matters along the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> were comparatively quiet yesterday until the time of the departure of the train for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The report that the enemy has crossed any considerable force to the north side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> has died away, and the people are as much puzzled in regard to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s future intentions as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We have received some further intelligence of recent operations which will doubtless prove interesting to the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> and during Saturday there was incessant skirmishing and picket firing, accompanied, at intervals, with heavy cannonading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, from <time value="12:30">half past 12</time> to <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time>, there was furious artillery firing from our batteries on the <rs>Chesterfield</rs> side of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>.--The discharges were estimated at <num value="30">thirty</num> per minute, and it is thought that not less than <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> guns participated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The earth fairly shook with the reverberations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was at <num value="1">one</num> time thought that our batteries were shelling the enemy's mortar lines, but the citizens of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> seem as ignorant of the erase of the demonstration as those living at a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <hi rend="italics">Express</hi> says it was stated on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, by an officer who seemed to be well posted, that the cause of the cannonade was an attempt of the enemy to throw a brigade or more across the river under cover of darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It was, however, a signal failure, for our men were well prepared to check any such movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The storm of iron rained upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on that night must have amounted to at least a ton, and the noise was perfectly terrific. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> On Sunday the usual picket firing and mortar shelling was renewed, and continued until a late hour of the night. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He carelessly advanced some distance in front of his men, when he was suddenly halted by <persName n="Grigg,Adjutant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grigg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant">Adjutant</roleName> <surname>Grigg</surname></persName>, who drew his pistol and demanded a surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sharpshooters endeavored to prevent the capture of their officer, and kept up quite a lively fusillade; but the <rs>Adjutant</rs> succeeded in bringing off his prisoner, with his horse and accoutrements. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> A bombshell thrown into the midst off an assembled crowd in a time of profound peace, a clap of thunder in a clear sky, or the sudden explosion of a magazine in which no powder had been kept for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century, could not have produced a greater sensation than the annunciation through the city press yesterday morning that the gentlemen whose names are printed at the head of this article had opened with <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> &mdash; of all other men in the world &mdash; a correspondence, requesting safe conducts to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, in the character of peace negotiators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The morning papers seem to have been taken entirely by surprise &mdash; so entirely that not <num value="1">one</num> of them made a single remark upon the circumstance, although it is the strangest and most unaccountable that has come to notice since the commencement of this war. These men were not, it seems, invested with any power to make proposals for peace &mdash; they were only &#x0022;in the confidential <hi rend="italics">employ</hi> (how we hate that <name>French</name>-<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> word) of the <rs>Government</rs>.&#x0022;--<persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, therefore, is clear of any imputation in connection with the affair.
