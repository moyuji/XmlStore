<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Davis Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is enough to know that Government finds hope in them, and that it is even now making all haste to put some of them to the test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>So long as such expedients are in reserve, however extreme we may deem them, the rebel Government will not look toward submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>It will try every desperate measure sooner than face that. </p>
