<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The long lines of infantry, cavalry, and artillery reported by the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">signal corps</orgName> some days ago to be crossing the <rs>Tennessee</rs> to the north side, are now believed to have been forces sent out for the purpose of escorting provision and forage trains to <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama">Stevenson</placeName> and <placeName reg="McMinnville, Warren, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100213">McMinnville</placeName>, whence the <rs>Federal</rs> army obtain their supplies.--Their wagon trains have been sent across the river and parked only for greater safely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>A few brigades of infantry have also been transferred to the north bank with a view to guarding <placeName reg="Butler's ford">Butler's ford</placeName>, <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> below the north end of the mountain, and <placeName reg="Kelley's ford">Kelley's ford</placeName>, some <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure> further down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The river at the town is in the form of the letter &#x0022;S,&#x0022; in the northern curve of which, but on the south side of the river, the <rs>Federal</rs> army is encamped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>A heavy battery has been planted on the tongue of land on the north side, and on that part of the curve which sweeps around to the south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This position gives them an enfilading and oblique fire upon an attacking column moving against their front, which is also defended by <num value="3">three</num> lines of breastworks running from <num value="1">one</num> curve of the river to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>These lines form a semi-circle in front and are the complement to the bend of the river in the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Within the circle thus formed by the river in the rear and the lines of entrenchments in front, there are a number of hills or elevations which are crowned by formidable earthworks and batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Some of these defences were erected by <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, but they have been greatly strengthened and multiplied by <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> since the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>There is a star shaped fort of large extent in front of the railway depot, and near the curve of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><num value="800">Eight hundred</num> or a <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">thousand yards</measure> to the right of this, on the line of the <orgName n="Eastern Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">East Tennessee railroad</orgName>, is another work of equal dimensions, but different in form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This seems to be a redon.--Back of these <num value="2">two</num> works, on an eminence near the river, and between them, is a strong redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>On the high hill behind the town are other batteries admirably located.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Indeed, the entire curve of the <rs>Tennessee</rs> occupied by the enemy is covered with a network of forts, breastworks, masked batteries, and rifle-pits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Many of them can be seen distinctly from <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>, whilst only portions of others can be detected among the trees and behind the hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When viewed from our picket lines in front, as I saw them this morning, they look formidable enough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Can this stronghold be taken by a direct assault?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Were <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName> thus taken?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Strong as the position is already, <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> shows no disposition to relax his efforts to render it really and absolutely impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><orgName n="Day and Night" type="newspaper">Day and night</orgName> his engineers are at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Possibly the place could have been carried by storm, though not without heavy loss, had we pressed forward from the victorious field of <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>If any mistake has been committed it was in not making the effort at that time.--It is too late now, I fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It may be only <num value="2">two</num> alternatives are left us &mdash; either to dig up to the place as the enemy did at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName>, or to man&#x0153;uvre him out of it. To do the former will require time and labor; to do the latter will be difficult and hazardous, as will be apparent to the most casual observer of the map of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> This is not the only disagreeable truth we have to record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Reinforcements have reached <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> since the battle, and others are expected.

The retention of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> is considered as of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance, not only as regards <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, but as a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">point d'appui</hi></foreign> in the future conduct of the war, and it will be held if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The papers admit the defeat of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, but ascribe it to the large reinforcements which they say were sent to <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Gen,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>When will our people learn that they injure themselves only when they destroy railway bridges?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The bridges could not be used by the enemy without cars, and of the latter they had none this side the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, and could not get any in a space of time which would not have been ample to replace the bridges. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> sent in this morning, under flag of truce, <num value="192">one hundred and ninety-two</num> ambulances and several wagons with supplies for his wounded in our hospitals, who have been paroled and will be returned to him this evening and to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The ambulance train was met at a point between the <num value="2">two</num> picket lines, and there turned over to Confederate drivers, who will go for the wounded, bring them back to the same point, and there deliver them to the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> It is believed that <num value="10000">10,000</num> will cover our loss in killed, wounded, and missing, and that <num value="20000">20,000</num> will cover the enemy's, including <measure n="7000" type="prisoners">7,000 prisoners</measure>, of whom <num value="5000">5,000</num> were well men, taken in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>There seems to be some doubt about the wagons reported among the spoils of the victory, and the number of flags taken is <num value="20">twenty</num>, and not <num value="40">forty</num>, as reported to me by <num value="1">one</num> of the highest officers in the army.--Of the <num value="25000">25,000</num> stand of small arms picked up on the battle field, a portion of them, of course, were dropped by our own killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is reported that a few more guns have been found in addition to these captured during the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The number is now said to be <num value="43">forty-three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The flags taken have been sent on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by the brave men who captured them and such company officers as greatly distinguished themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It is not probable that our killed will exceed <num value="1000">1,000</num>; of the remaining <num value="9000">9,000</num>, it is not believed that more than <num value="2000">2,000</num>, if so many, were severely wounded, all the rest receiving slight wounds. </p> <closer> <signed>Sallust.</signed> </closer> </div3>

In a little time even this bread became so scarce that the crowds assembled at the bakers' shops fought for it as dogs fight for a bone, and, much bloodshed having been the consequence, the wisdom of the <rs>Convention</rs> could devise no better remedy than to fix a rope to the door of each shop, and to decree that whoever could get hold of it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> should be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> served, and that nobody should be served who did not have it in his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>As it cannot be expected of political philosophers and talking legislators that they should be gifted with so vulgar a quality as common sense, they overlooked the very striking probability that men would fight for the rope as frequently and as hard as they had hitherto fought for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> turn at the bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It so happened, however, and their ingenuity not being sufficient to carry them farther, they disturbed the mob no farther, but suffered them to go on and fight in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>To improve the quality of the bread, however, and to remedy the deficiency in the supply of that somewhat necessary article, they put a <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi> also upon the products of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>This had an effect the contrary to that which was anticipated, for the farmers refused to produce, and the scarcity grew into famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The guillotine, though sufficiently active, could only bring the horse to the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It could not make him drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The farmers would not continue their operations, simply because they were ruined by arbitrary requisitions, and could not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Our legislators propose to adopt this system most vigorously. --If they will only enact a few <num value="100">hundred</num> portable guillotines into existence, and send them around to enforce the maximum, they will, no doubt, bring <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> into the same condition that <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> was in <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It takes <hi rend="italics">time,</hi> however, to ruin a country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>We doubt whether this can be done before the winter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> The Convention took all the <hi rend="italics">pensions</hi> (boarding houses) into their own hands and put a <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi> upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>This example is sedulously followed by our Legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They have determined that board shall not exceed a certain sum per month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>This is all right, all patriotic, all just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/><measure n="100dollars" type="currency">One hundred dollars</measure> in the <name>Memminger</name> assignats will bring just <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> in specie or sterling bills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It is perfectly fair to allow no boarding-house keeper to receive a larger sum per month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>This is an excellent rule, and its beauties become more and more apparent every month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>In a few months he will bring down the dollar in assignats to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num>, and then the boarding-house keeper will get exactly <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> for feeding a hungry month a whole month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>They found that if producers were not allowed to sell by auction they would not produce, or would not sell at all.--But our legislators spurn examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Let our Legislature try the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The result in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> was very encouraging.--Famine, pestilence, bloodshed, and every other evil that was let out of the fabled box of <persName n="Pandora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Pandora,nomatch:0"><surname>Pandora</surname></persName> pervaded the land. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> Lastly, the <rs>Convention</rs> broke up all the banks and all the brokers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They guillotined every man who was convicted of selling assignats for less than their nominal value in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This example our Legislature could not overlook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>They are devising high penalties for selling gold at a higher price than <persName n="Memminger,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><surname>Memminger</surname></persName> assignats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Penalties for traffic in gold have heretofore been prescribed by nearly every civilized country under the sun, and they have invariably operated as <hi rend="italics">premia</hi> for the exportation of gold. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> All this time the &#x0022;infernal machine&#x0022; is operating with the most inexorable energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Our legislators do not reflect at all that the depreciation of the currency is the main cause of the <hi rend="italics">nominal</hi> high prices, and that inflation is the cause of the depreciation. </p>
