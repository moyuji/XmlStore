<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The great battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last, fought on the memorable and classic ground of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, resulted in the overthrow of the combined armies of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, with a loss that is perhaps unequalled in the annals of the present war. We write without particulars; but the dispatches received by the <rs>President</rs>, and now given to the public, warrants the belief that our triumph is complete and glorious, and that the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> is probably to-day within hauling distance of the <rs>Federal</rs> capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dispatch received yesterday morning represented that the enemy had made several attempts to break through our lines, which intercepted their retreat towards <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, but were repulsed each time with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>No mention of the casualties on our side was made, except that <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Trimble,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Trimble,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Trimble</surname></persName> were badly wounded, but not mortally, and <persName n="Taliaferro,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName> slightly wounded.--A large number of prisoners were said to have been captured by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This fight occurred in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Manassas Plains">Manassas Plains</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The indefinite character of this dispatch created some anxiety, and although it was stated that the enemy had been repulsed, still some uneasiness was felt, and some apprehensions entertained, for the safety of the gallant corps that, to the public, seemed to be between the <num value="2">two</num> armies of the foe. These apprehensions were dispelled, however, by the later and more authentic intelligence of the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Late in the afternoon, a dispatch was received by the <rs>President</rs> from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, conveying information which left no grounds to question the glorious success of our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Our army, it was stated, was still pursuing them, but in what direction we did not learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>If it be true, as previously represented, that our forces had gained the rear of the enemy, and repulsed their attempts to recover their intercepted lines we do not understand by what route they are now endeavoring to effect their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Large supplies of valuable stores were captured, some of which were destroyed by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> If correct, the news from <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName> is scarcely less important than that from Manassas Late last night it was asserted that news had been received in official quarters to the effect that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <persName n="Morgan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> had attempted to cut his way through our lines, and that he was repulsed with great slaughter, after which his entire command, amounting to some <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men, with their arms and equipments, surrendered to our forces under <persName n="Smith,General,E.,Kirby,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="default:Smith,E.,Kirby,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There is every reason to believe that this statement is correct, as it is well known that <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>'s position was decidedly precarious; but in view of the many similar reports received from the same quarter it should be taken with much caution. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> We learn from an intelligent gentleman, who has lately visited a portion of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, though keeping up a great show of strength in the counties of <placeName reg="James City, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,1002511">James City</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A great many of the negroes who were taken off by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have returned to their owners, and express themselves as heartily tired of their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But the worst feature in the intelligence which we have received is, that the rascals have appropriated to themselves a large portion of the provisions in tended for the inmates of the asylum, and there is great danger of their suffering.

<head>Our Successes not unnatural.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, in <num value="1">one</num> of his late speeches, represented the turn which the war in this country had taken as altogether without precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>He no doubt, had placed implicit confidence in the reiterated promises of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> to put it down in the next <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, and, like <persName n="Hickman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><surname>Hickman</surname></persName>, believed that <num value="20000000">20,000,000</num> were able to best <num value="7000000">7,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>In forming this opinion he seems to have deliberately shut his eyes to all the lessons of history; and if history be what <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bolingbroke</foreName></persName> defines it to be &mdash; philosophy teaching by examples--<persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> is assuredly not such a statesman as ought to be at the head of a Government like that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> While there have been many examples of successful resistance to the invasions of nations more powerful than the invaded there have been remarkably few instances of a successful invasion where the war was national on the part of the people threatened with subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Where the invaded people depend upon a great standing at my, and that army is defeated and destroyed, it is natural enough that they should submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>They have generally little public spirit, and probably think themselves likely to be as well off under <num value="1">one</num> ruler as under another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>But where the heart and soul of every man is enlisted in the cause, subjugation is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>A people thus united in love of their own country and hatred of the invader may be defeated in a score of bloody battle, but they think no more of submission the day after a defeat than they do the day after a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>They may be exterminated, but they cannot be conquered.--Hundreds of instances supporting the truth of this position might have been found by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, if he had taken the trouble to look for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName> invaded <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> with <num value="2600000">2,600,000</num> fighting men; the largest army of which we have any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>His camp followers amounted to as many more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>He thus precipitated <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000000">six millions</num> of human beings upon a knot of little republics, whose united population probably did not amount to the number he brought with him. Yet he sustained the most disastrous defeat and the most entire overthrow that any invader ever met with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The <rs>Gauls</rs>, for centuries, were in the habit of hurling their masses by hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Republic, always with the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The sparsely settled island of <placeName key="tgn,7001093" n="1.000 3" reg="corsica">Corsica</placeName> set the powerful Republic of <placeName key="tgn,7008546" n="1.000 5" reg="genova,genova,liguria,italia,europe">Genoa</placeName>, backed at <num value="1">one</num> time by the whole force of the <rs>Spanish</rs> monarchy, at defiance for <measure n="300years" type="date">three hundred years</measure>. <measure n="200years" type="date">Two hundred years</measure> of war did not enable <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to conquer <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, though her population was <num value="6">six</num> times as great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> could overrun, but he could not conquer <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>All continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> combined could not conquer <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> when <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs> guided her destinies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> Why should <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> suppose we are easier to conquer than any of these?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Our men are as brave as the best of them all. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are not better soldiers than the <name>Gauls</name>, or the <name>Genoese</name>, or the <name>Spaniards</name>, or the <rs>French</rs>, or the <rs>English</rs> were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The disproportion of numbers is not so great as it was in any of the cases mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are not more than <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>When our negroes are taken into the account &mdash; and they should be, for they till the ground, and thereby enable those who would otherwise be compelled to stay at home to take the field &mdash; they are not more than <num value="1.5">one and a half</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>In every battle &mdash; on fair ground &mdash; we have in the meantime beaten them <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Upon what rational ground, then, can <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> rest his astonishment at the turn things have taken? </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
