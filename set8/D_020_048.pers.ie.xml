<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> I will not tell of my feelings on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, the battle day, as I heard the incessant boom of the cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was awful &mdash; a day I can never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Mother was very desponding, but I can truthfully say my faith in our men never wavered, not even when an officer told us that he had received a dispatch saying that <placeName key="tgn,7013988" n="1.000 2272" reg="bull run, prince william, virginia">Bull Run</placeName> was taken and the <q>&#x0022;Grand Army&#x0022;</q> was marching on <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Not even when late at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I was told that <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was taken and <num value="30000">30,000</num> Southerners had laid down their arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>My indignation passed all bounds at this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I heard the next morning was that the <rs>Federals</rs> were pouring down the road, the <rs>Confederates</rs> in full chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>(Oh, if it had been altogether true!) And so they continued to come all day, <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> at a time, sometimes fewer; but early in the morning it was <num value="1">one</num> continual stream of broken down, beaten, famished men. They declared that for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> they had <sic>had</sic> nothing to eat or drink, and we all on the hill sent them every available thing in the house; and mother had coffee made and sent to them, and, what do you think, they actually thought it was to sell!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They were treated in the same way in town, every <num value="1">one</num> opening their hearts and hands to a broken down, conquered foe. I certainly never saw such a forlorn set. Some had even thrown off their shoes and jackets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>To see <num value="1">one</num> with a knapsack was a rarity, and very few were armed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Some were perfectly infuriated, and swore they would pay us Southerners for it if they ever got a chance; but most of them seemed to be inspired with a pretty wholesome fear of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and have no desire to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/><num value="1">One</num> old Irishman who was asked by some <num value="1">one</num> as he came hobbling by, grumbling at <q>&#x0022;them big batteries,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Why they didn't take them?&#x0022;</q> replied naively enough--<q>&#x0022;Faith, sir, and we couldn't. They's been building them batteries and digging them plus these <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and all the <rs>South</rs> was in 'em and behind 'em, and could ye expect the min to take 'em?&#x0022;</q> Some swore vengeance on Congress, and were for starting right off to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They rushed in such swarms that the draws of the <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs> were kept open all day and night, and all travel stopped between here and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>This dismay extended to the officers &mdash; probably begun with them too; all seemed to be disheartened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But the next day, such a change!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Saying, <q>&#x0022;it wasn't much of a beating; they'd soon remedy it,&#x0022;</q> &#x0026;c., and telling all sorts of <hi rend="italics">abominable lies</hi> about the cruelty and barbarity of our men. It gives me an utter contempt for the whole crew to hear how they abuse each other &mdash; the soldiers, their officers, the volunteers, the regulars, and all pitch into <placeName key="tgn,2112810" n="1.000 32" reg="mcdowell, highland, virginia">McDowell</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, who has superseded him, is expected to do great things, but they glorify them all until they get a whipping, and then quietly drop them or speak of them with contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Better adopt the system of the <rs n="Carthaginian" type="ethnic">Carthaginian</rs>: kill all who are not victorious; it is not much more contemptible than their present course, and, perhaps, might have a salutary effect, as fear seems to have been the motive power which has governed a good many; it has undoubtedly moved them to take <num value="1">one</num> good run. As I heard some <num value="1">one</num> say, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> went up avowedly to see the <rs>Virginia</rs> races, but we will give them the palm and allow ourselves beaten in running.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I glory over them now, for I am sickened out with their bombast and brag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But the day they came back I really felt heartily sorry for them, and never thought of exulting &mdash; though I have had many and many of them tell me to my face, knowing that I was Southern, that the <name>Southerners</name> were <hi rend="italics">all cowards.</hi> I told them whenever they said this, that it did not speak very highly for their bravery, to come down in such <hi rend="italics">hordes</hi> to fight an enemy, who, in their opinion, were all cowards and numerically inferior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The way in which they gloss over their defeat is contemptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Before the fight we were told that <num value="80000">80,000</num> had marched up to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and that we had only <num value="30000">30,000</num> and could get no more; now they swear they had not more than <num value="30000">30,000</num>, some say <num value="10000">10,000</num>, and that we had <num value="90000">90,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>How they reconcile these statements I cannot see. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> <date value="08-13"><hi rend="italics">August 13th.</hi></date>--I am hopeless about getting this to you, but I still write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The New York <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> leave to-day, at which we are really very much grieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It is the regiment stationed at the <rs type="place">Seminary</rs> &mdash; the officers, at least the <rs>Colonel</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Major">Major</rs>, &#x0026;c., have been very polite, and have their men under excellent discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We have had a guard stationed at our gate to keep the stragglers out by which we had been very much annoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>To-day some officers came in search of a camp ground; I told them this was private property, and enlarged on its incapacities for such a purpose so eloquently, that they finally went off; but no further than the <rs type="place">Bishop's field</rs> across the road where they have pitched their tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>As we sit on the porch we can hear the neighing of their horses and the rattle of their sabres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>In the adjoining fields back are encamped <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> regiments; at <persName n="Lockwood,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Lockwood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lockwood</surname></persName>'s another troop of cavalry; in <persName n="Sparrow,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Sparrow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Sparrow</surname></persName>'s field another, and at the <rs type="place">Seminary</rs> still another, besides <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> regiments of infantry, and on <persName n="Herbert,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Herbert,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Herbert</surname></persName>'s hill <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> more regiments, I don't know which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I wish every time I look at them that the <rs>Confederates</rs> would come down on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It would be such fun to have them chased from under our very noses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>All this is, as you may imagine, very uncomfortable, as the roads are full of soldiers, and some of them are very impertinent; and in town it is no better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Ladies are never seen on the streets now. I can only say how long!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I would give everything to be away from these horrible wretches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> The people are discontented, but they have not risen in insurrection, and the cannon and bayonets of the <rs>Federal</rs> army are able to suppress a rebellion if such was attempted.--With the exception of a riot which the police promptly suppressed, and with whose authors and abettors the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> are prepared to deal, there has been no unlawful or serious demonstration of hostility towards the <rs>Government</rs> within the borders of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>It might, therefore, have been supposed that a President who was merely anxious to execute the laws would have been careful not to go beyond the scope of his constitutional powers in this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>More especially was such a course to be expected from an Administration which insists that the vast majority of the people here approves its conduct and loyalty endorses its measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>But so far from conforming, under such circumstances, to the laws which he affects to respect, or from acting upon his own theory that the people of this State are staunch supporters of his coercive and unconstitutional proceedings, he has done wanton violence to his sworn obligations and his own convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>He has disregarded the fundamental rights of our citizens; he has trampled upon our laws; he has deposed our public officers; he has defied the authority of our courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>He has committed almost every outrage that usually marks the career of a military usurper in a subjugated province, save murder; and we have every reason to fear, even if he does not follow the <rs>Tribune</rs>'s advice, and resort to <q>&#x0022;wholesale&#x0022;</q> hanging, that he will at least soon have to answer for the life of <num value="1">one</num> injured and innocent man who, not less enfeebled in body than sick at heart, is enduring brave martyrdom in <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Does he assume to rule us as <num value="1">one</num> who has been lawfully set up over us, or does he exercise a way here as a military dictator by right of conquest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Is it peace or war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>It the former, we claim protection of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws; if the latter, we insist on a proclamation to that effect; for, otherwise, no man can know how to guide his steps aright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>If we are a subjugated people, and are to be held as such forever henceforth, let us know it, and we may, perhaps, be then enabled so to walk that our conduct may be in future void of offence towards our rulers.

<head>The Philosophy of laughter.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> Though it is possible, as Hamler noted in his tablets, for a man <q>&#x0022;to smile and be a villain,&#x0022;</q> yet we hold it to be impossible for a villain to laugh heartily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>When the consummate ruffian of a melodrama consigns the hero and patriot of the piece to the <q>&#x0022;lowest depths of the darkest dungeon,&#x0022;</q> he naturally breaks forth with a ha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>ha! but it is as far removed from genuine merriment as the host of a midnight owl. <q>&#x0022;Laugh and grow fat&#x0022;</q> and chesty and dark deeds never yet went together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>It was the <q>&#x0022;lean and hungry Cassins&#x0022;</q> that struck down C&#x00E6;sar at the base of <q>&#x0022;Pompay's statue which all the while ran blood.&#x0022;</q> Mephistopheles, indulges in the sardonic laugh, but not in the genial roar of honest merriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Your true philosopher is he who is <q>&#x0022;merry and wise,&#x0022;</q> for mirth and wisdom are hand in glove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/><persName n="Jerrold,,Douglas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00409" reg="default:Jerrold,Douglas,,,"><foreName>Douglas</foreName> <surname>Jerrold</surname></persName>, who made many a man laugh in his day, thus apostrophises laughter: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/> &#x0022;O, glorious laughtered Thou man-loving spirit, that for a time dost take the burden from the weary back; thou dost lay salve to the feet <unclear></unclear> and cut by the flints and shorts, thou takest blood-making melancholy by the nose, and makest it grin despite itself; that all the sorrows of the past, the doubts of the future, confoundest in the joy of the present, that makest man truly philosophic, conqueror of himself and earth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>What was talked of as the golden chain of Jove was nothing but a succession of laughs, a <unclear>chro</unclear> seals of merriment, reaching from earth to <persName n="Olympus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00410" reg="mostcommon:Olympus,nomatch:0"><surname>Olympus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>It is not true that <persName n="Prometheus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00411" reg="mostcommon:Prometheus,nomatch:0"><surname>Prometheus</surname></persName> state the fire, but the laughter of the gods, to <unclear></unclear> our clay, and in the abundance of our merriment to make us reasonable creatures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/> <q>&#x0022;Have you ever considered what man would be, destitute of the ennobling faculty of laughter!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Laughter is to the face of man what synovia, I think <unclear></unclear> call it, is to his joints &mdash; it oils, lubricates, and makes the human counter once divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>Without it, our faces would have been rigid, hyena-like; the iniquities of our hearts, with no sweet antidote to work upon <unclear></unclear>, would have made the face of the best among us a horrid husky thing with <num value="2">two</num> sullen, hungry, cruel lights at the top &mdash; for foreheads would then have gone out or fashion &mdash; and a cavernous hole below the nose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Think of a babe without laughter &mdash; as it is, its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>The creature shows the divinity of its origin and end by smiling upon us. Yes, smiles are its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> talk with the world, smiles the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> answer that it understands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>And then, as worldly wisdom comes upon the little thing, it crows, it chuckles, it grins, and shakes in its curse's arms, or, in waggish humor, playing to peep with the breast, it reveals its high destiny, declares to him with ears to hear the heirdom of its immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Let materialists blaspheme as gingerly and acutely as they will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>They must find confusion in laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Men may take a triumph and stand on his broad grins; for he lacks around the world, and his innermost soul, sweetly tickled with the knowledge, tells him that he of all creatures laughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Imagine, if you can, a laughing fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Let man, then, send a loud ha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>ha! through the universe and be reverently grateful for that privilege.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
