<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> I noticed in the issue of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>,</hi> of the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">2d inst.</day></dateStruct>, an article over the signature of &#x0022;T,&#x0022; calling attention to the sufferers from the burning of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I agree entirely with the writer of that article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Although the writer of this is not a refugee from <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, yet for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> he enjoyed the hospitality and kindness of its citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He knows of many who, during his stay in that beautiful town, were wealthy, possessing all the comforts and luxuries of life, who are now wanderers from their once-loved homes and who with the greatest difficulty can barely find the means of support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>There are very many who suffer for the necessities of life, and why is it that our <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName> can appropriate <measure n="50000dollars" type="currency">fifty thousand dollars</measure> to the sufferers of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and allow these gallant and chivalrous people, who are willing to apply the torch to their own houses and destroy all they possessed for the advancement of the glorious cause they loved so well, to suffer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> We do not object to the contribution to the sufferers of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, but we do think that while this contribution is being made to the citizens of a distant State, the <name>Legislature</name> ought not to be unmindful of those of our own State, who, with patriotic purpose, fired their own houses, and consumed all they had rather than they should fall into the hands of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We know that the feelings of those, who have been accustomed always to enjoy the comforts and blessings of life, when they are suddenly deprived of them, although they might suffer most severely, will not allow them to condescend to ask for those things which are necessary to relieve their wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Now we urge the <name>Legislature</name> to make an appropriation for these people; and to the churches of every denomination, and the good people, not only of this State, but of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, we make an earnest appeal that they contribute something to this deserving object. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I imagine that the chief difficulty in the way is the large amount of security required. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>But in the present case, the reverend gentleman contended that no insult being intended to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, there could be no cause for war. America had exercised too much leniency in the matter, and the whole thing could have been made so plain that every nation upon earth would have cried shame on <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for demanding reparation for this supposed insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It would have been considered the most boundless cruelty on record, excepting, perhaps, the war on <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> for the sake of forcing opium on that unfortunate people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It looked as though <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> would embrace that nation of slave traders.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> The question involved in these few words is not <num value="1">one</num> of merely the craft of the play-wright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>I candidly admit that your estimate of public sympathy, as expressed last night, is as just as it is inexplicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Since the <rs>Uncle Tom</rs> mania, the sentiments of the <rs>English</rs> public upon the subject of slavery have seemed to be undergoing a great change; but I confess that I was not prepared to find that change so radical as it appeared to be when the experiment was tried upon the feelings of a miscellaneous audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>May I claim your attention to this view of a subject fraught with much serious interest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> A long residence in the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> had convinced me that the deliniation in <q>&#x0022;<persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s Cabin.&#x0022;</q> of the condition of the slaves, their lives and feelings, were not faithful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>I found the slaves, as a race, a happy, gentle, kindly treated population, and the restraints upon their liberty so slight as to be rarely perceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>A visitor to <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, who might expect to find his vulgar sympathies aroused by the exhibition of corporeal punishment and physical torture, would be much disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>For my part, with every facility for observation, I never witnessed any ill-treatment whatever of the servile class; on the contrary, the slaves are, in general, warmly attached to their masters and to their homes, and this condition of things I have faithfully depicted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> But, behind all this there are features in slavery far more objectionable than any of those hitherto held up to human execration, by the side of which physical suffering appears as vulgar detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Some of these features are for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, boldly exhibited in the <name>Octoroon</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The audiences hailed with every mark of enthusiasm the sunny views of negro life, they were please with the happy relations existing between the slaves and the family of which they were dependent, and the heartiness with which the slaves were sold and cheered the planters who bought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>But when the <name>Octaroon</name> girl was purchased by the ruffianly overseer to become his paramour, her suicide to preserve her purity provoked no sympathy whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Yet, a few years ago, the same public in the same theatre witnessed with deep emotion the death of <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> under the lash, and accepted the tableau of the poor old negro, his shirt stained with the blood from his incerated back, crawling across the stage, and dying in slow torture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> In the death of the <name>Octoroon</name> lies the moral and teaching of the whole work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Had this girl been saved, and the drama brought to a happy end, the horrors of her position, irremediable from the very nature of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, would subside into the condition of a temporary annoyance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Upon the article of soul, and upon the moral attributes, and the domestic and social affections, the genuine <rs>Jouathan</rs> was never very exclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Butpure reason was the <name n="God" type="God">god</name> of his idolatry, and the capacity to calculate consequences, discerning his interests, and holding on to them at all hazards and to the last extremity, were the chief glory of the sons of the <name>Pilgrima</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The head and not the heart was their seat of greatness, and looking out for <num value="1">Number One</num>, the great end of humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> Estinated then by the standard which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have themselves adopted, what are we to think of Yankeedom as illustrated by the present war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>What has become of that super-eminent reason by which they claimed so be exalted above all other men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>What of their intelligent self-interest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>What of their capacity for calculating consequences and taking care of <num value="1">Number One</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>There is no explanation of their course except on the theory of national insanity, of a moral epidemic which has seized upon their whole race, and prostrated their Goddess of Reason in the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>That all their interests were involved in the precervation of the late Union, they now admit, and that of all the ways of reaching it, war is the last, every <num value="1">one</num> under heaven sees but themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Yet they persist, at an enormous expense, in carrying on a gigantic scheme of invasion, which now, after a year's trial, has proved a fearful abortion, and which, every hour that it continues, increases the hazard of adding a crushing war to their <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> embroilments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> After the crowning madnees of electing a President by the <rs>North</rs> to rule over the <rs>South</rs>, and after the secession of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States, there was still a course by which they migh have averted the heavy judgment that their folly had provoked, and have even held out a chance of a reconstruction of the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>They might have withdrawn from the forts of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> the few <num value="100">hundred</num> soldiers who were not strong enough to protect the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and whose presence only tended to irritale the <rs>South</rs> and provoke collision and bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>They might have nought to conciliate the border States, which were eager to meet them more than half way, and when would have clung to the <rs>Union</rs> forever if they had been permitted to do so without dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>But in vain these States, led on by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the grand, historic old Commonwealth of the <name>Revolution</name>, begged and implored for compromise and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Instead of being warned by the solemn attitude of the border States, the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> population was excited to such a pitch of frenzy as had never before been board of outside a lunatic asylum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We believe that the day will come when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will read the accounts of their horrible menaces against the purity of Southern households and the lives and honor of Southern men at the beginning of this war, and confess that they were stark, staring mad, raving Bedlamites, and fit only for straight jackets and a mad house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Yet this is the people who have always held themselves up as the incarnation of pure reason, and have affected to look down from their iceberg elevation upon the sunny <rs>South</rs> as a race of impulsive, passionate beings, who were mere children in comparison with the wise, rational, self-possessed, and self-restraining philosophers of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> It is to be hoped that the present contest will beach the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> true wisdom, which consists in knowing <num value="1">one</num>'s self, and in knowing other people, in both which branches of knowledge they have shown themselves lamentably deficient, and which also includes the cultivation of the moral as well as the intellectual faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>They are engaged at present in the most Quixotic project ever undertaken by any people since the foundation of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If they could subjugate the <rs>South</rs>, it would only be by the extermination of its inhabitants and the desolation of its whole territory, a consummation which would involve their own manufacturing and commercial destruction as well as that of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>But they cannot succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They are piling up mountains of debt only to ensure disaster, disgrace, and everlasting bankruptey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The South will dispute every inch of ground with them, from <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It will make every hill top an Alleghany fight, and every plain a Manassas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It will demonstrate its independence to the satisfaction of all maukind; and when it has done so, the powerful nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, always willing to help those who are able to help themselves, will array themselves against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They will be turned out to graze &mdash; like Nebuchadnessac &mdash; with the oxon, and become in the end a sadder, but a wisernation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>All our streams and water-courses have been traveled over by the diligent enemy at night time in large launches, rowed in some instances by negroes, with the object, no doubt, of finding the positions of our camps, and the practicability of the ascent of gun-boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>These expeditions have been heard in some instances, and in others again, where steamers accompanied them, have been driven back with loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>They had gone but a few miles when, nearing a bend in the river, they heard a boat approaching, their light-boat fully loaded, and which a musket shot would have sunk, they forced into the march, the stern protruding some feet into the river.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> So completely secured were they by the march, that the sharp eyes of the negroes, every day accustomed to such chances, failed to detect them, though their heads were above the tallent spear of grass.
