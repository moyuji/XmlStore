<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> <placeName reg="The Richmond">The Richmond</placeName> correspondent of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> refers to the undoubting faith of the <rs>North</rs> that the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> will ultimately assert their ascendancy over the acceded States, and contrasts this firm assurance with the absurd and irrational despondency and doubt which all our marvelous military successes have not been able to dispel from some minds in the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> The <hi rend="italics">Times's</hi> correspondent will do us a service if he can shove the croakers and grumblers into a more hopeful and manly attitude; but we submit that they are not the true exponents of the spirit and sentiment of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Coming in contact chiefly with citizens, and not with soldiers, it is natural that a stranger should express the opinions we find in the letters of the <hi rend="italics">Times.</hi> But the country is now to be found in the army, not among those who stay at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The heart, the brains, the bravery, the patriotism, the chivalry of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are to be found in front of the foe, and not in the pursuits of civil life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>We must look to the army if we want to know whether the faith and hope of the <rs>South</rs> are equal to the hope and faith of the <rs>North</rs> in the issue of this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>And never did hope and faith burn brighter in human hearts than in those which are ready to shed their last drop of blood in the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It is stated by those who have recently visited the army that it is really a relief to get away from the gloomy atmosphere of trade and speculation and mingle with the fighting men; it raises the spirits, strengthens the faith, and animates the hope to come in contact with the veterans who, for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, have fought triumphantly against the greatest odds the <rs>North</rs> could bring, and who feel as sure that they can whip her again as that they have whipped her a <num value="100">hundred</num> times before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> We do not consider that all the non-combatants of the country are faithless and despondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>But many of them are old men and unmanned by the infirmities of age; and, many more so immersed in the pursuits of money-getting, that the sentiment of patriotism has nearly died out. Others are naturally timid, and have the instinct of self-preservation, which has kept them out of the army, unduly developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Others are fault-finders and factiousness, who are more intent upon gratifying their personal prejudices than solicitous for the success of the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Then there are the constitutional croakers, the frogs and bats and owls, who delight in darkness, and who are never so happy as when they are miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The smallest cloud in the sky is magnified into a coming thunder storm, and a regular thunder storm into the end of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Even when we are victorious, their utterances of exultation are as lugubrious as the crowing of a Shanghai cock, and intimate in every tone a doubt of the permanency of good fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>If they were good for anything, if they were even fit to be eaten, their necks ought to be wrung, and their carcasses, carefully packed in salt and ice, sent on to the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> Without hope and faith neither man nor nation was ever successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>If that minority of our home people which is vexing the ears of the world with their disconsolate hootings were a fair representation of the <rs>Confederate</rs> people, we might well despair of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>But the army is the people, and the army never doubts, and has as little respect for the croakers in its rear as the open enemies in its front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>And the large majority even of those who remain at home never permit themselves to question the ultimate result of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>In view of the gigantic efforts of the foe, and the resources in men and means which the whole world has placed at their disposal, our people may well feel profound solicitude, a sentiment which is deepened by the singular incompetency of their Congress to solve the difficulties of our financial affairs, and their morbid deficiency of coolness and promptness in meeting the military exigencies of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>But were they to doubt for a moment the ultimate success of the <rs>South</rs>, there would be preparations for such an exodus from the <rs>South</rs> as has not been witnessed since the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> left <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>If we have not hope in the final triumph of our cause, what earthly thing have we to hope in?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>No hope of country, no hope of home, no hope of human happiness in any form is permitted us, no resting place for the dove's weary feet, except the <name>Ararat</name> of Southern Independence. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> It is objected to the military bill lately passed by the <name>Senate</name> that, in ordering everybody in the country into the military service, it plays the last card of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and that at a period when the enemy has not begun to exhaust himself, and when our own resources of men, if deserters and stragglers are brought back to their duty, are not seriously diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Behold, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will exclaim, how this boasted Confederacy, at the end of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, is on its last legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>It has used up in that short time so many of the young men of the country that it is now compelled to drag their fathers from their unprotected homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>If, in <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, we have crippled the youth and vigor of the country, how long will it take to demolish and annihilate its old age?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Not more than <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> at farthest, and when the old fogies are disposed of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will be bereft of its last resource of defence, and nothing will remain but for us to walk in and take possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> But this premature exultation of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, should the <name>Senate</name> bill pass the <rs type="place">House</rs>, will be without any foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Even when the old men are exhausted, when the fathers and grandfathers of the land are devoured by the sword, and their families exposed to famine and insurrection, there is still a resource not touched, nay, expressly exempted by the military bill of the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>For Congress has exampled itself and the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> from all military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Whilst the crisis is so urgent that gray-headed men must be forced into the ranks, it is not so urgent that members of Congress and of the <name>Legislatures</name>, many of them in the prime and vigor of life, should be called to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The object of this is patriotic, noble, and glorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>It is to form a reserve, which may rush to the resene of the country when all else has failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>When the old men of the land are exterminated, and only women and children left to occupy the farms and plantations of the country, then, in that supreme hour of peril and agony, the <orgName n="Spartan Band" type="band">Spartan band</orgName> of the <rs>Capitol</rs>, which has reserved itself for <placeName reg="Thermopylae, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2716872">Thermopylae</placeName>, will confront the consolidated cohorts of despotism and strike a last blow for liberty and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Let no <num value="1">one</num> despair of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It is not by immense numbers or approved weapons of war that great military results are always accomplished.
