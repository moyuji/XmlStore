<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There is not much news this morning from the various points threatened by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Yesterday passed off quietly, without even a rumor of magnificent victories or disastrous defeats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The people, having been furnished with full accounts of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>'s battle on the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>, became satisfied that it was not so bad as they had supposed, and <num value="1">one</num> and all took a more cheerful view of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In short, events settled down into their usual current, and each individual citizen, undisturbed by &#x0022;war's alarms.,&#x0022; pursued his customary avocation with the most perfect confidence as to the result of present military movements. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He is still engaged in fortifying, his works having already assumed formidable proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> show no disposition to depart, but are rather endeavoring to advance their lines and approach as near <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The occupation of this road, it cannot be denied, is an unfortunate event, chiefly on account of the inconvenience to which it subjects the <rs>Government</rs> and the people; but it is believed that matters will shortly assume a more promising aspect. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our loss has not yet been stated officially, but we are assured that it is much less than that of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A refusal was given, and the <num value="2">two</num> officers became engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter, the result of which was that <persName n="Hagood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hagood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hagood</surname></persName> slew his opponent and bore off the flag in triumph. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We are reliably informed that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has refused a passage down the <rs>James</rs> to the representative of the <rs>Consul</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, with dispatches for the <rs>French Minister</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It appears that on <name>Sunday</name> the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-Consul">Vice-Consul</rs> proceeded to <placeName reg="Fuquay-Varina, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074737">Varina</placeName>, and in accordance with a privilege heretofore freely accorded, secured his passage by the flag-of-truce boat, was assigned a <rs n="state room" type="product">state- room</rs>, and made every arrangement for the journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At night the boat was visited by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in person, who, without the knowledge of the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-Consul">Vice-Consul</rs>, had an interview with <persName n="Mulford,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Mulford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mulford</surname></persName>, and instructed him to refuse a passage in the boat to that official or any <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The consequence was that the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-Consul">Vice-Consul</rs> had to return to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> with his dispatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We are utterly unable to comprehend this proceeding on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He might be carrying on some operations down the river that he wished to conceal, it is true; but that does not excuse an act of discourtesy towards a representative of the <rs>French Government</rs>, and we can only account for it by the supposition that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had indulged rather too freely in old <rs n="Bourbon" type="royalfamily">Bourbon</rs> on Sunday and became vindictive under its effects. </p> </div4>

<head>From <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 4" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The news from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> relates chiefly to the operations of a raiding party, under <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s, sent out by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to destroy our railway communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>There is a wide discrepancy between the <num value="2">two</num> dispatches, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> estimating the raiding force at <num value="25000">twenty-five</num> to <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num>, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> at <num value="2500">two thousand five hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The latter is, doubtless, nearest the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/><placeName key="tgn,2022849" n="1.000 5" reg="fairburn, fulton, georgia">Fairburn</placeName>, the point at which they met with some success, is on the <orgName n="Atlanta and West Point Railroad" type="railroad">Atlanta and West Point railroad</orgName>, <measure n="19miles" type="distance">nineteen miles</measure> from the former place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>which their own Congress and their own people have not committed on a vastly extended scale, and with the addition of <num value="10">ten</num>-fold horrors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> We are induced to make these observations by a paragraph in the press telegram of yesterday morning, in which it is stated that <num value="400">four hundred</num> citizens had been killed in a riot in New Orleans, occasioned by <persName n="Canby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:Canby,nomatch:0"><surname>Canby</surname></persName>'s attempt to enforce the draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>When <persName n="Clinton,Sir,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="default:Clinton,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clinton</surname></persName> captured <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> in <date value="1780-05">May, 1780,</date> he published a proclamation, in which he called upon the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to return to their homes and remain quiet, promising all who did so that they should not be disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>His successor, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>, disregarding this promise, called upon all people capable of bearing arms to come forward and assist in putting down the rebellion, and his agents and emissaries traversed the <rs>State</rs> from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other in order to compel obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>This proclamation produced results the opposite of those intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The people had staid at home under the impression that they would not be compelled to engage in the war; but finding that they were compelled to fight, they determined to fight by the side of their countrymen, and not against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Many who had even taken the oath of allegiance, on the condition, either expressed or implied, that they would be allowed to remain quiet at home, considered themselves absolved from their engagements by this new proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Among others who stood in that category was <persName n="Hayne,Colonel,Isaac,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="default:Hayne,Isaac,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Isaac</foreName> <surname>Hayne</surname></persName>, who was afterwards captured and executed by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Rawdon</foreName></persName>, whose name has been held in execution from that day to this by the whole continent of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have written nearly all the books that have been published touching the revolution of <unclear><num value="76">76</num>;</unclear> and there is not <num value="1">one</num> of these books in which the conduct of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> is not severely reprobated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The idea of drafting men against their will to fight against their own countrymen, and probably to kill or be killed by some of them, is too shocking to think of. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> historians were perfectly right in denouncing the atrocity when it was practised by the <name>Myrmidons</name> of <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>; but we hear not a word of censure, now that the executors of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s will are doing the same thing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> No men denounced more bitterly than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the <rs>English</rs> practice of impressing seamen from vessels belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> among the many causes that conspired to bring on the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, and during that war the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, in a formal document, denounced as unchristian and inhuman a policy which retained the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> seamen thus impressed, and rendered them liable to fall by the hands of their own countrymen on the deck of an enemy's vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>In what do the drafts of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at New Orleans and elsewhere differ from this practice of the <rs>English</rs>, save that, having been adopted while war is actually raging between the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it multiplies an <num value="100">hundred</num>-fold the danger of collision between the men thus impressed and their brethren in the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, and that it is infinitely more sweeping, more tyrannical, and more inhuman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>There is, indeed, no circumstance which can aggravate the horrors of war that has not been introduced into this contest by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> There seems to be little doubt that <num value="1">one</num> among the several causes which led to our failure on the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>, last <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, was the extreme carelessness with which the secret of the intended attack had been kept. &#x0022;If the enemy,&#x0022; says our correspondent, &#x0022;X.,&#x0022; in a letter published by us yesterday, &#x0022;were not apprised of our attack, it was not because the plan and time were not known, even to the very urchins of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Whose fault it was that these matters leaked out, I do not know, but I do know that <measure n="18hours" type="date">eighteen hours</measure> before, the time, place and character of the fight were on the lips of all, soldiers and citizens.&#x0022; Doubtless the enemy soon became as well informed as the &#x0022;soldiers and citizens&#x0022; in question; and to this cause, more than to any other, we are inclined to trace the painful result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>How can success be expected under such circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>How, indeed, can anything but disaster be the result? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> This is not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since the war began that plans well laid, and promising the greatest success, have been defeated by premature discovery.--Our readers will recall many, and they cannot but do it with shame and vexation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The fault always lies at the door of some consequential <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Aide de camp">aide-de-camp</rs>,</hi> or some leaky clerk, whom it has been found necessary to entrust with the secret, and who cannot keep it without bursting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The law ought to provide a heavy penalty for such offences, no less than instant degradation from office and forced service in the rank and file of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Somebody about the person of the <rs>General</rs>, or the <rs>Secretary</rs>, or the <rs>President</rs>, must always be the person to blab, otherwise how is it passable for the secret to get out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> is well known to be a gentleman of great reticence on all matters connected with his official duties, while the <rs>President</rs> and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Daniel,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> are as secret as the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>These matters must come out through other and inferior agencies, and it is of the last importance to find them out and make an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Of all an aide-de-camp's accomplishments we should think that of knowing how to keep his own counsel, and that which is entrusted to him by others, the most important, as it seems to be the rarest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> While we are upon this subject, we cannot forbear to remark the extreme want of discretion observable in some of the papers published near the scene of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Whatever the conductors learn with regard to the movements of troops they seem to publish without the slightest hesitation or consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It must be exceedingly difficult to conduct an enterprise requiring secrecy to a successful issue anywhere in the neighborhood of any of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>In the struggle for precedence in the article of the latest news, they appear to care very little about the propriety of publishing it. If they can get it, they publish it, let the consequences be what they may. We have no doubt that to this source we may trace much of the ill-success that has attended our exertions in that quarter and the fact that our army is now south of the <rs>Chattahoochee</rs>, when it should be at least north of the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, Success cannot be expected when the newspapers reveal every intended movement to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> should be particularly cautious in selecting their aids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>They should always choose men who have some brains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Brains, indeed, should be a principal requisite after valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>A man without brains, occupying a place of trust, is the most dangerous of all animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>He always has it in his power to do harm, and he seldom fails, to the extent of his ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>To trust such a man with an important secret is equivalent to publishing it in a newspaper.
