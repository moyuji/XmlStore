<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He regretted that so few of the <rs>Eastern</rs> members were in their seats, because it was to them that he desired chiefly to direct his remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He had listened with much pleasure to the speech of <persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> on the preceding evening, and gave his assurance that his efforts would be met by the <rs>Western</rs> people in a spirit of fraternity.-- He could not fold his arms and say &#x0022;all is well.&#x0022; for we were involved in questions of great difficulty and doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Alluding to the charge of unsoundness on the slavery question, he said that no charge of that nature had been made by any Eastern man; to a Western member belongs that <hi rend="italics">honor,</hi> for he alone had done it.--He (<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S) claimed, that notwithstanding the draw backs of unjust legislation, the <rs>West</rs> was true to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, and true on principle; if the <rs>East</rs> was true, it was true from interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Why then, would they not trust this question in the hands of Western men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He contended that the position of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> as a slave State demanded the protection asked for by the <rs>West</rs>, in order to develop its resources and maintain its character as a part of the Old Dominion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was the duty of the <rs>East</rs> to extend the olive branch, in order to unite the whole State, and bind all the people together in defence of her rights.--His people were willing to protect the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, but they insisted that this property should be taxed as their horses and cows were taxed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Unless the demand were granted, they would have but a poor excuse to go before their people and ask them to protect the <rs>East</rs>, telling them at the same time that it was in the power of Eastern men to protect the <rs>West</rs>, but they refused it. If this was persisted in, it would be as easy to move <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName> from their base as to convince the <rs>West</rs> of the propriety of going out of the <rs>Union</rs> for any present grievances. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He hoped he would be at last set right before the public. </p>

He felt some reluctance to trespass upon the patience of the <rs>Committee</rs>; yet there were some propositions on the table which had not yet been touched, and to those he intended to address himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This Union, which we had heretofore regarded as perpetual, was broken up, <num value="7">seven</num> States having withdrawn, and the entire country was now threatened with destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was in view of this fact hat the <rs>Convention</rs> was assembled, to legislate, in this emergency, for the safety and honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It was a misfortune, that when the interests of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> demanded the best exertions and wisest counsels of her sons, that we were so circumstanced as to make it difficult to agree upon that course which ought to be followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Yet might the, not, by prudence and conciliation agree upon something which would meet the exigencies of the case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Elected by counties, coming from all parts of this extended Commonwealth, we necessarily in our own persons represent the varied interests which are found to exist in these wide limits; and if a cause is sought for the diversity of opinion which characterizes this body, we have only to look abroad to the <rs>State</rs> we represent for an explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He then alluded to the varied interests of the several sections, showing that in these was founded the conflict of sentiment in regard to the mode of settling the question at issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He maintained that it was our duty to consult the interests of the entire State, and so to act as to meet the views of the people of the whole Commonwealth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> His own portion of the <rs>State</rs> was as deeply interested in the settlement of this question as any other portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He lived on the borders of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and the people there were connected commercially with the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If cut off from those advantages, a blow would be struck at their vital existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Hall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hall</surname></persName>,</hi> of <persName n="Wetzel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Wetzel,nomatch:0"><surname>Wetzel</surname></persName>, desired to inform the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 18" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName> that he was mistaken as to the important points of trade for the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The most important point was New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The pork, potatoes, and other produce were boated down, and on the route had to meet the competition of the free States, as well as at the end of the route. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <persName n="Scott,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Scott,James,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> said he had supposed that the salt, coal and oil of the <rs>West</rs> found its market in the <name>States</name> bordering on their territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The cattle of the <rs>West</rs> find a market in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and none of that great trade has its direction South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and even New York, furnish the market which that great staple of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> finds practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He did not know about the pork and potatoes &mdash; They might be boated down the <rs>Ohio</rs>, to find a market in the <rs>South</rs>; but he spoke from information derived from others in regard to the salt, coal and oil, and in regard to the cattle trade he spoke from his own knowledge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> He urged with force the position that this Convention ought to look to the whole and act for the whole and shape their measures with respect to all interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Where opinions, conflict, we must yield to circumstances, and compromise with each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Here were various propositions which he purposed to consider, and inquire which was the best calculated to subserve the purpose of securing that safety which the interests of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>His sympathies, interests, feelings and instincts all attached him to the <rs>South</rs>, and if the alternative were presented to him of going with the <rs>Northern States</rs>, or with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, he would unhesitatingly say with the latter.--But he designed to consider whether, by proper amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, a plan might not be matured for the reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> upon a basis acceptable to all the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>In this connection he look up the majority report, which concedes that without the proposed changes in the organic law of the country, it is unsafe for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to remain a member of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He repudiated the idea that any <num value="1">one</num> who advocated that report could be deemed a submissionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He went on to consider the position of the <rs>Border States</rs>, whose interests and opinions were similar to those of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and whatever affected <num value="1">one</num> affected all, rendering it necessary that they should act together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It was only necessary to satisfy our Western fellow citizens that by any action we might adopt they were not to be separated forever from the <rs>Border States</rs>, to bring them to consent to the policy proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>There was an encouraging prospect of united action among the <rs>Border States</rs>, and it seemed impossible to conceive that <placeName key="tgn,7007710" n="1.000 8" reg="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania, Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> would ever consent to a separation from the <name>States</name> with whom their interests were so intimately connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The purpose is to secure united action on the part of all the <name>Border</name> slave States; that when <num value="1">one</num> secedes, all shall secede; thus bringing about the necessity for a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He then went on to enforce the positions previously advanced, and subsequently alluded to the mighty progress of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic, expanding from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs>Pacific</rs>, until it had reached a point in the foremost rank of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Its products had grown to such proportions as to become a necessity to the industry of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Might we not look with feelings akin to admiration upon its grandeur?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It was not strange, then, that we should find in a <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, <num value="1">one</num> sentiment of love for the <rs>Union</rs> running through the entire mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>All admitted this, and yet there was a division of opinion which he feared would keep us apart to the end. Was there no mode by which we could avoid the <name>Scylla</name> on the <num value="1">one</num> side or the <name>Charybdis</name> on the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>no middle passage, through which all could arrive at a safe and satisfactory conclusion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Such a desirable result might be attained by an agreement upon the plan proposed, assuming that the interests of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be best protected in a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> when the <rs>Border States</rs> were there with her. Necessity might compel her to go without them; but choice, never.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He took a position upon his amendment offered on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last, providing that after the failure of the efforts of the <rs>Border States</rs> in primary Conventions, should they fail, a Congress of such States shall be called for the purpose of recommending a Constitution upon which the <rs>Union</rs> of all the <name>States</name> may be safely reconstructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>This he considered a middle ground upon which all parties might stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It was said by some that the propositions would be rejected by the <rs>North</rs>, and that therefore it would be idle to present them.--He, however, could see no reason why they should not defer so much to the opinions of others, as to go through the brief space which these forms and ceremonies would occupy, to prove the justice of their conclusions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> He had left his home for this Convention, full of hope for an adjustment of all the pending difficulties; but he was sorry to say that this hope, if not entirely vanished, had now become very faint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><num value="2">Two</num> plans had been proposed; <num value="1">one</num> through amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> through the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName>, and another through a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>, called on the demand of <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> had been appealed to and failed, for the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions had been repudiated by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The other was impracticable, for the seceded States would not enter into such a consultation, which would be necessary in order to carry out the plan, since they were not recognized by the <rs>North</rs> as a separate and independent Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Although he had little hope of an adjustment now, he was willing to appeal to it, in deference to the opinions of others; for in the event of a failure, we should then all be united. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> He did not believe it was practicable now to procure a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> through amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, nor did he believe in the practicability of immediate secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>There would be as little hope from <num value="1">one</num> side as from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The Border States had only to stand firm upon their own soil, going with neither wing, but bring both to their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>If the <rs>Border States</rs> agreed to withdraw from their association with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, he contended, that Government would necessarily have to abdicate the <rs>Federal Capital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The Government would then be ours, and with such a prestige of greatness, there would be no difficulty in drawing either section to the common centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>This plan of reconstruction and restoration he believed was practicable, and looking upon the others as impracticable, he rejected them and adopted this because of its practicability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>After some introductory allusion to the fact that he had not heretofore trespassed upon the time of the body, he went on to revert to the origin of the <rs>Government</rs>, and to the fraternal feelings which had existed on the part of the <rs>South</rs> towards the <rs>North</rs>, until the <rs>Northern</rs> people broke up that friendly sentiment by their own aggressions; showing that they, with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, were responsible for the establishment of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> here, and after having forced it upon us, now desired to destroy our safety and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He demonstrated by facts occurring throughout the progress of the anti-slavery agitation, that a continuance of the present Union with the <rs>North</rs> was utterly impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Republicanism of modern days, as he showed from declarations of their leading men, was the child of abolitionism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The crisis now upon the country he considered a fearful <num value="1">one</num>. <num value="7">Seven</num> States had left the <rs>Union</rs>, and others threatened to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The question arose, what is to be the destiny of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>In his judgment, the destiny of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He was for a Union of the whole <rs>South</rs>, but if this could not be obtained, he would have the <rs>Union</rs> as strong as <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> could make it.--He had little hope of any adjustment that would bring the <rs>North</rs> into a position to do justice to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It was a forcible argument in favor of immediate action, that while we were waiting, the whole business of the country was prostrate, under the uncertainty of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He thought the <rs>State</rs> should at once place herself in a position of security in the house of her friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>He did not agree with the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 18" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName>, that secession would be a measure of war; for every movement that strengthened the hands of the <rs>South</rs>, would be another barrier to any attempt at coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The separation of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, he feared, was eternal; for unless the abolitionists entirely abandoned their position, it would not be difficult to demonstrate the utter hopelessness of a reconstruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> He drew a contrast between the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> and the oppressive and odious legislation of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and went on to criticise the report of the committee, deeming the guarantees there demanded as utterly insufficient.--He would be satisfied with nothing short of perfect equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>He held that the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should immediately resume the powers which she delegated to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and place herself in a situation to make absolute demands as a condition of any future reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>.--The report of the committee, he argued, contained declarations which Southern men should never assent to. He would not vote for anything that did not give our property the same protection in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> that was given to the property of Northern men who emigrated thither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>It held out the idea that there was a moral degradation in the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>After a glance at the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num> resolution of the report, which he did not consider strong enough, the <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> resolution <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> was referred to as the most remarkable of all. It gives to the <rs>Northern</rs> people <hi rend="italics">carte blanche</hi> in the matter of time to make responses to the demands. --He thought there would scarcely be a response from the abolition crew, in answer to demands for justice, before the time of the blast of the <rs>Archangel Gabriel</rs>'s trumpet.-- Such an indefinite proposition he entirely opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The report also gave to the <rs>North</rs> everything they wanted, while to the <rs>South</rs> it secured no protection, for it took from us that which we already had under the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>In answer to the argument of the gentleman from <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>, (<persName n="Rives,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Rives,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName>,) who brought it down to a calculation of dollars and cents, he said that no such consideration should recompense us for a sacrifice of principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>But the argument was demonstrated by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Richardson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="nearbymention:Richardson,Allen,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName></hi> to be a mistaken <num value="1">one</num>, by a mathematical calculation in regard to the number of slaves annually run off upon the <orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">underground railroad</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> Viewing the question of secession in connection with the circumstances that surrounded us, he argued that the interests of the constituent body required that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Every gentleman here admits that when oppression becomes intolerable, we have the right of revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>He had shown that the wrongs inflicted upon us were intolerable, and therefore we had the right of revolution, <hi rend="italics">a fortiori</hi> we had the right of secession; for the sovereign power of a State might exercise the same right that was accorded to organized bodies of men. Because we had thus far submitted to wrong, it was no reason why we should submit forever. --On the contrary, he considered it a forcible argument in favor of present resistance. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The immediate application intended to be made of the facts we shall give, will be to the proposition now before the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, to wit: by remaining with the abolition <rs>North</rs>, to crush out and expel her magnificent institution of slave labor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> In the case of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the driving out of her negroes will not be the inviting in of free laborers; for these latter could only be brought in by slow degrees; and the heavy weight of taxation that would immediately fall upon the inhabitants of the <rs>State</rs>, on the stampede of the slaves, would utterly forestall, and shut the door to, the ingress of free laborers; so that the expulsion of her half <num value="1000000">million</num> of laboring population would be a dead loss to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, which would not be replaced in any form for generations to come.--But even upon the supposition that an equivalent amount of slave labor would immediately come in to occupy the place of her stampeded slaves, we are about to show that in that case <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would still be a heavy loser by the exchange. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> We have already shown that in the swampy and feverish region of Tide-water, white labor cannot be profitably employed in its agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We have already demonstrated, from the large areas and <hi rend="italics">numbers</hi> of hands required for the cultivation of tobacco with profit, <sic>that</sic> that plant cannot be grown to advantage by the free labor system of petty farmers and small capitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>But even conceding, for the sake of argument, that <persName n="Virginia,,Tidewater,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="default:Virginia,Tidewater,,,"><foreName>Tidewater</foreName> <surname>Virginia</surname></persName> and the tobacco crop of our State could be cultivated by free white laborers, still it will be shown that the exchange of her slave laborers for these, by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, would be attended by heavy pecuniary losses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> Even without the proof of facts and figures reason would teach us that the productions of the individual freeman, working at his leisure, are not greater than those of the athletic <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave working under compulsion; while the fact is obvious that white citizens' wants and necessities are much greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It follows of necessity, that the <hi rend="italics">surplus</hi> production of the white freeman is much smaller than of the black slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> I wrote you, some days ago, from &#x0022;<placeName key="possibilities=38" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Three Forks</placeName>,&#x0022; in <placeName reg="Roane, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002293">Roane county</placeName>; gave you some account of the &#x0022;Oil <persName n="Wells,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00429" reg="mostcommon:Wells,nomatch:0"><surname>Wells</surname></persName>,&#x0022; the improvement in the country since my visit, <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, and some information in regard to the political sentiments of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Since then, I have ridden about <measure n="200miles" type="distance">200 miles</measure>, throughout <placeName reg="Wirt, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002302">Wirt</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2001909" n="1.000 1" reg="roane county, tennessee">Roane</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wood, Ohio, United States" key="tgn,1003033">Wood</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ritchie, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002292">Ritchie</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jackson county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002268">Jackson counties</placeName>, and have not failed, I think, in any instance, when occasion offered, to follow up these investigations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> Almost every stranger in the country is regarded as an &#x0022;oil man,&#x0022; &#x0022;prospecting,&#x0022; as they call it; and when I tell you that I, too, have taken a &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">lease,</hi>&#x0022; and might have been seen, more than once, examining the banks of <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs>, and discussing, from house to house the &#x0022;oil fever,&#x0022; you might think the charge a true <num value="1">one</num>; yet, that was not the object of my visit altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Finding men &#x0022;boring&#x0022; above and below my land, and others &#x0022;leasing&#x0022; my land to be bored, I naturally became interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>There is no doubt about the fact that the oil region is not confined to the little valley or bottom, through which flows the &#x0022;<placeName reg="Burning Spring, Washington, Ohio" key="tgn,2208568">Burning Spring</placeName>.&#x0022; From the source of the spring to the Little Kanawha, where it empties itself, is not <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure>; and, indeed, the oil wells below the mouth of the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> are very productive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>To-day I learned that a well had been discovered <measure n="20miles" type="distance">20 miles</measure> down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>I have seen many persons boring miles above and below, and several on the opposite side of the river; <num value="1">one</num> of the latter found oil last week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>Since my visit, last <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> week, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> persons have reached that wonderful reservoir, and hundreds of others hope to tap it soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Geologists make the oil region to being in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and extend southwesterly, to the <rs>Great Kanawha</rs>, and the &#x0022;indications.&#x0022; of &#x0022;surface oil&#x0022; seem to warrant the opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/><persName n="Reedy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00430" reg="mostcommon:Reedy,nomatch:0"><surname>Reedy</surname></persName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> and its branches extend some <num value="30">30</num> or <measure n="40miles" type="distance">40 miles</measure> southwesterly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>By the way, the lands in the <rs type="place">Reedy valley</rs> are not appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>They are remarkably fine, and the country is quite picturesque.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>When I say the lands are not properly valued, I mean that they are not cultivated by those who live on them as they should be, and they are not properly sought after by those in the more eastern part of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>An experienced farmer from <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, who accompanied your correspondent, was really enthusiastic in regard to the fertility of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>With proper farming, I really think the <rs type="place">Reedy Valley</rs> would become famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>If to the beauties of nature were added the <name>Swiss</name> cottage and the thorough cultivation of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> husbandry, this Valley would rival many of those on the <name>Continent</name>, long celebrated for their picturesque beauty and loveliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>But the difficulty of getting lumber has compelled almost everybody to live in cabins of hewed logs, and excluded everything like taste in building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>You never see a brick house, and very few that are weather boarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/><persName n="Mills,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00434" reg="nearbymention:Mills,Charles,S.,,"><surname>Mills</surname></persName> are very scarce, and in the summer farmers have to send very often <num value="15">15</num> or <measure n="20miles" type="distance">20 miles</measure> to have a little grain ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>A saw and grist (steam,) mill would doubtless pay well if located in this Valley. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> In regard to politics, my subsequent investigations have confirmed the opinion expressed in my former letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>I stopped at the house of a very old man a few days ago, and in introducing the subject of Northern aggression, the fire kindled in his eye and he said, &#x0022;My father was in the <name>Revolution</name>, and I was in the last war; and though my eyes are dim, I am ready to fight for the <rs>South</rs>.&#x0022; He further said he had <num value="4">four</num> rifles--<num value="1">one</num> he would try to use himself, and the other <num value="3">three</num> he would lend to his neighbors who had none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>On inquiring if he could rely upon his <hi rend="italics">aim,</hi> he took down a long, heavy rifle, which hung upon <num value="2">two</num> wooden forks in the ceiling, and said he thought he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>Your correspondent would not like to carry such a rifle more than a few hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>It was almost a <hi rend="italics">load.</hi> This old patriot lived only about <placeName><distance reg="15miles">15 miles</distance> from the <rs>Ohio</rs></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>You find <num value="2">two</num> classes of Southern men here, as you will find in your city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Both classes are <hi rend="italics">true,</hi> and the difference between them, I have often thought, depended more upon the natural peculiarities of their minds rather than upon any real dissimilarity of their views of our rights and wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Some men will always decide and act quickly; others slowly, but not the less surely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>The latter often temper wisely the former. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> In coming to-day from Ellenboro' to this place, (<measure n="35miles" type="distance">35 miles</measure>,) I passed <num value="4">four</num> large freight trains, carrying the wealth of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to enrich northern cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>I must confess I felt ashamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>These heavy loaded cars should have been on their way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>But our city is little known here &mdash; not at all commercially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>There is no way of getting there except by passing through <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Hence a friend the other day expressed his surprise at the political identification of the people here with <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, while there seemed no material bonds to unite them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>But thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, truth and justice will always unite noble hearts, however separated by interest and space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>But I must conclude, or weary your patience. P. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>It is expected that this discovery will explain why the earth is increased in fertility by being broken up and exposed to the air.
