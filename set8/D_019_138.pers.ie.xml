<head>Something more about arms.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> We are glad to see that in the views we have expressed on this subject we have the concurrence of our able contemporary, the <orgName n="Richmond Enquirer" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>That journal expresses the opinion that in the rural districts every house possesses arms enough for its own defence a gun for every <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> male, or about <num value="950000">950,000</num> rifles and shot-guns, the private property of the <rs>Southern</rs> population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>That paper says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> &#x0022;Knowing this to be the case, we are disposed to be a little incredulous when we hear it said that certain localities could send additional companies into the field, if it were not for the impossibility of obtaining suitable arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>No doubt every company organized would like to have the best arms in use; but when this is unattainable, it ought not to follow that the country should be left undefended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is true that the rifled musket can do execution with some precision at the distance of <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>, and that the shot-gun at the same distance would do none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There is a very simple mode of shortening the distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It is not the weapon as much as the man who used it. A people, whose farms are threatened with confiscation and whose hearth-stones with pollution, will scarcely wait for improved arms to defend themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In your issue of yesterday I noticed a most timely and able article upon the subject, in which you advance the only true doctrine, that it is the men, and not the arms, by which battles are won.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The Prussian needle gun, the caraoine-a-tige, and the generality of breach loading arms, are extremely liable to blow very badly, and when injured in the field are difficult to repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Even the far-famed <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> will <hi rend="italics">lead</hi> after repeated discharges, and we will find after all, that the best gun for hard service is <num value="1">one</num> of simple construction, easily loaded, strong, portable, and reasonably accurate at long distances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>For accounting, fancy and parade shooting, extreme accuracy may be desirable at almost fabulous ranges, but your true fighting distance is <num value="1">one</num> that gradually diminishes, and the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier is going to advance when he sees a Yatile, and not bother his brain with thinking of <unclear><hi rend="italics">haueestr factories</hi></unclear> and the like, amid the clouds of smoke that cover every battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> Nothing I could say can be worth <num value="1">one</num> fact which has forced itself upon my mind in reference to the sentiments which prevail among the gentlemen of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I have been among them for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>I have visited their plantations; I have conversed with them freely and fully, and I have enjoyed that frank, courteous and graceful intercourse which constitutes an irresistible charm of their society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>From all quarter has come to my ears the echoes of the some voice; it may be feigned but there is no discord in the note, and it sounds in wonderful a <unclear>rength</unclear> and monotony all over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>I'll see that <hi rend="italics">his</hi> mutton is cooked hereafter, and not on such a melancholy subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>To resume the diseased: whatever can be said of him, no man can declare that he wasn't a patriot!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Look back on his record, and see what's thar!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Who introduced the bill that allowed <placeName key="tgn,2106205" n="1.000 4" reg="nacogdoches, nacogdoches, texas">Nacogdoches</placeName> to repudiate all her bonds held by persons outside of the <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>Why the diseased?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>And it was through his stupendous efforts <sic>that that</sic> 'ar bill was passed into a law. It was done squar' and noble, and without no shekoonery for the benefit of this yer great <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>His'n sir, was the squar' and manly efforts on that bill that relieved <placeName key="tgn,2106205" n="1.000 4" reg="nacogdoches, nacogdoches, texas">Nacogdoches</placeName> from a heavy load of debt, made the town to flourish like a <placeName key="tgn,2121307" n="1.000 92" reg="green bay, brown, wisconsin">Green Bay</placeName> tree, and kept the money in the <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>And if that ain't patriotism, what is, <rs type="role" reg="Mister Speaker">Mr. Speaker</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>It can't be rubbed out, and I don't try to rub it out, <rs type="role" reg="Mister Speaker">Mr. Speaker</rs>, that some of the bondholders that was hit by the bill barked after the diseased, and squirmed and tried to give him a hyst in the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>But what cared he for that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>Virtue is its own reward, <rs type="role" reg="Mister Speaker">Mr. Speaker</rs>; and no great notion was ever done but what the man who done it was barked after by somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>But the diseased, entrenched in the glorious armor of patriotism, with his hand on this yer record, could defy chain lightning in any shape; and when prostrate and sick and satiated he lied on his prostrate bed &mdash; at the house of <persName n="Jones,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00404" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, where, as I had occasion to remark, and as it is profoundly proper to remark, no matter whose corns is <unclear>rod</unclear> on, the members of this yer house is furnished with board <hi rend="italics">and</hi> lodging at a <hi rend="italics">uniform</hi> price of <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure> a'nsff a week, washing not included, the thought of that bill and that record and that patriotism come to his wounded sensibilities and his sinking form like a heavenly angel, and death couldn't set him, even <num value="0.5">a half</num> turn, back any!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>I close, <rs type="role" reg="Mister Speaker">Mr. Speaker</rs>, this melancholy and afflicting duty by moving that a committee be appointed to draw resolutions on the diseased and report; at the same time remarking that the gorgeous and smiling heavens has opened to receive his mortal spirit, and that his earthly remains will be buried to morrow at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> from the house of <persName n="Jones,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00405" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, where it is eminently proper to remark, and I do it emphatic, that board <hi rend="italics">and</hi> lodging can be obtained at the moderate price of <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure> n'aff a week, washing <hi rend="italics">not</hi> included, where the diseased boarded and occupied an elegant room now unfortunitly vacant.
