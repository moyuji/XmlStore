<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> I have seen it stated in the <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> correspondence of some Northern papers, that &#x0022;the citizens are coming into the fort at the rate of <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> a day to take the oath of allegiance to the <sic>the</sic> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>This <hi rend="italics">may</hi> possibly be true, but the correspondent forgets to tell his readers how these patriotic citizens came thus to express their love for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If I am not able to supply this deficiency positively, I think I can come a <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">little</hi>&#x0022;</q> nearer the truth than he had done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>At any rate it is but fair to view the case from a Southern stand-point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The account as reported by some of our people is this: That on the calling out of the militia recently, by some means, probably by treachery, the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities got possession of the list of men in all the peninsula between <placeName reg="Back River, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2142203">Back river</placeName> and <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Immediately, armed soldiers were sent from house to house, and every man capable of bearing arms was marched at the point of the bayonet to the <rs>Fort</rs>, and there compelled to take the oath or suffer the consequences, confiscation of property and imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Now, I do not say positively that this is the true state of the case; but I do say that such is the commonly reported version of the case here, and such is perfectly consistent with what officers, high in command, have told the writer was the rule by which they would govern themselves toward our people, viz: that <q>&#x0022;whilst all possible protection would be given to those who would take the oath, no favor would be shown to those who would not do so.&#x0022;</q> If they would threaten to arrest and imprison a citizen, who, both by age and oppression, (as in case of <persName n="Adams,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev. Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>) is exempt from military duty, for refusing to take the oath, is it at all improbable that they would arrest and comed to take it those actually enrolled for military service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>But even if it should be true that the people of <q>&#x0022;For <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="nearbymention:Hill,J.,C.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>&#x0022;</q> are going to the fort to swear allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, it is by no means an evidence that similar disloyalty to the <rs>South</rs> obtains in other neighborhoods.--That part of <placeName reg="Elizabeth City county">Elizabeth City county</placeName> is largely settled by <q> &#x0022;Truckers,&#x0022;</q> who live by supplying, not only the fort, but Northern cities, with their produce, and hence the blockade has brought their craft into danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>And who can tell what even an honest man will not do when his resources are about to be cut off, and starvation is staring his family in the face? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> I recently had the (I was going to say pleasure, but conscience forbids) mortification of seeing some specimens of the celebrated <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Bartlett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>'s Naval Brigade.&#x0022;</q> I am not surprised that <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> (I think it was <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>) should have said that <q>&#x0022;this Brigade would strike terror to the heart of the <rs>South</rs>.&#x0022;</q> Their mere appearance is <q> &#x0022;enough to strike terror&#x0022;</q> to any civilized community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>I don't wonder that the hen-roosts and pig-pens, as well as parlors and bed-rooms should have suffered so much after the advent of these precious specimens of Northern degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We must not be too severe in blaming them for supplying themselves with some of the comforts of life on finding themselves in a land of plenty.--Judging from their appearance, I should say they had never enjoyed the comforts to which the poorest of our negroes are accustomed.--Where <persName n="Bartlett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> got these men, I know not; but I am satisfied that if <q>&#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,2071503" n="1.000 7" reg="ossining, westchester, new york">Sing Sing</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> <q> &#x0022;<placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Governor's Island</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;The Tombs,&#x0022;</q> and the <q>&#x0022;<placeName key="possibilities=131" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Five Points</placeName>&#x0022;</q> had vomited upon our shores the worst of their population, more disgusting specimens of depravity and filth could not have been produced. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> Is it not distressing to think that so many precious and noble Southern lives must be imperilled in conflict with such beings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>There is however a redeeming feature even in this picture, that is, that rogues are always cowards, and such men cannot fight. </p>

<head>Teeth.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/> An elderly gentleman once observed: <q>&#x0022;I wonder why my whiskers grow grey before my hair. &#x0022;</q><q>&#x0022;Don't you know?&#x0022;</q> replied a rude fellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/><q>&#x0022;It is because you work your jaws more than your brain.&#x0022;</q> The remark was more wise than witty, though it was both; for, after all, what are more worked than jaws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>Do not eating and talking divide the result of many people's lives?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Are not our words our spiritual judges?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Are not our bodies prepared food?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Somebody &mdash; <persName n="Abernathy,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00429" reg="mostcommon:Abernathy,nomatch:0"><surname>Abernathy</surname></persName>, I suppose &mdash; says that all our diseases come from fretting or stuffing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Now, as the fretting is often more outward than inward, it wears the law as well as the heart; and as to stuffing, the members don't complain of the stomach, but the stomach and the members make common cause against the jaw. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/> This, to the <num value="1000000">million</num>, means Teeth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Teeth are the great blessings, curses, and characteristics of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>A year or <num value="2">two</num> ago, there was a capital picture in the <orgName n="Royal Academy" type="academy">Royal Academy</orgName>, the title of which was, <q>&#x0022;Toothache in the <rs>Middle Ages</rs>.&#x0022;</q> A monk was sitting on a bench, on which he had laid his untasted meal &mdash; and no wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>Eat, sir!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>He was past the howling stage; the skin of his cheek was tight and stiff; you could read, in the anguish of his eyes, the red-hot throbs which stabbed his jaw; he had tied it up, and was nursing it withal, dolefully in his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The picture was truly <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">catholic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Yes, at all ages, to all men, there has been at <num value="1">one</num> time or another of their lives, strong common sympathy &mdash; <persName n="Sardanapalus,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00430" reg="mostcommon:Sardanapalus,nomatch:0"><surname>Sardanapalus</surname></persName> might feel for a lazar, <persName n="Aristides,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00431" reg="mostcommon:Aristides,nomatch:0"><surname>Aristides</surname></persName> the <name>Just</name> for <persName n="Paul,Sir,John,Dean,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00432" reg="default:Paul,John,Dean,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Dean</foreName> <surname>Paul</surname></persName>--when he had a toothache. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/> Is not the progress of the teeth a sign?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Whether they be coming or going, whether at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or last end of life, in the day or the night nursery &mdash; do they not supply the liveliest illustrations of our changing moods?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Does not impatience <hi rend="italics">bite</hi> her lips?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Does not rage make men grind their teeth, and desperation set, and condemnation gash them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Does not the dog shew his before he bites?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Does not cold make them chatter in men, and excitement in monkeys?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>By the way, I'm afraid to think how much of the difference between these <num value="2">two</num> animals rests upon the confirmation of their respective teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>I remember hearing a lecture by <persName n="Owen,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00433" reg="mostcommon:Owen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Owen</surname></persName>, in which he explained the dental distinction between his audience and apes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>I really forget what it was. People clapped their hands, and friends nodded triumphantly to <num value="1">one</num> another, as much as to say. Now the great man has settled the question; but it was, I thought, a wonderfully cross shave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/> Do you know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Reader &mdash; my stumps all stir themselves as I write!--do you know that there are <num value="341">three hundred and forty-one</num> dentists in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>?--professed dentists, besides all those who belong to the medical profession, and draw teeth incidentally--<num value="341">three hundred and forty one</num>, which, according to recent regulations at the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName>, is only a few short of a battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Allowing a month a holiday, you might have a new <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> dentist every day for a year, and even then leave some out: all principals, too, and no assistants, but men with smiling confidence, supple wrists, immaculate linen &mdash; don't you always notice the <rs n="shirt front" type="product">shirt- front</rs> of your tormentor?--and easy-chairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>Oh, that half hour of anticipation in the waiting-room, when you turn over medical books, and look at the prints and pictures on the walls, and feel a sort of savage sympathy for each victim as he is carried away from the flock and swallowed up in the inner den, where you may sometimes hear him shriek, but whence you never see him return!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>The outer door shuts after <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour &mdash; those were his remains going out! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/> &#x0022;Then your own summons &mdash; But why recall the vision of that ghastly chamber? --Only, I must say that I think the process to be gone through before you have a single tooth replaced, is more extensive than need be. Why should he have the model of your whole jaw?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>I see him now, making at me with a little shovel full of warm wax &mdash; I hope it is new for the occasion, but it looks rather mottled &mdash; a little shovel, with a pat of wax about the shape and size of a penny bun, with a mouthful bitten out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/> <q>&#x0022;Impossible!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>my good sir!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/> But he pops it in, and squeezes it against the palate with such choking adherence that every gustatory nerve goes into fits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>We must forgive his consternation, when the subtle judge of sauce and wine finds himself suddenly encountered by a pound of soft <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> hand candle wax. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> I really think some other preparatory plan might be devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Couldn't they do it by photography?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>or under chloroform?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>or, better still, with something nice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>As it is, hours must pass after the operation before you can get rid of the peculiar cosmetic taste it leaves &mdash; something like that you might expect if you dined with the <rs type="role" reg="Lord Mayor">Lord Mayor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,2063473;tgn,7024573" n="0.028 000000.4214	placename;tgn,2063473;greenland, rockingham, new hampshire,Rockingham,New Hampshire,United States,North and Central America;0.021 000000.3224	placename;tgn,7024573;gronland,North and Central America" reg="greenland, rockingham, new hampshire,Rockingham,New Hampshire,United States,North and Central America;gronland,North and Central America">Greenland</placeName>, and sat between a tallow-chandler and a soap merchant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/><num value="341">Three hundred and forty-one</num> dentists in the <orgName n="London Post" type="newspaper">London Post</orgName>-Office Directory alone, besides those more or less instructed about teeth, discoverable in the same volume &mdash; namely, <num value="1890">one thousand eight hundred and ninety</num> surgeons! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/> Just consider what an amount of caries, inarticulation, toothache, and ill-humor this represents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>The preponderance of the profession is measured by comparing it with another &mdash; take hairdressers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>You want your hair cut whether you be well or ill &mdash; for every tooth drawn or replaced you have your hair cut scores of times: for every dentist there ought to be <num value="50">fifty</num> of the others, but there are barely <num value="3">three</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/> It is true, that much, probably most of the dentists' work, is to supply, not to withdraw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Take up the <rs>Times</rs>, and climb a ladder of dentists' advertisements; the extraction of teeth bears a small proportion to their replacement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>The operation is so graphically attractive, so painless, so ingenious, that I wonder people don't have it done for pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>It would seem to be a luxurious gratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Those who go to be shampooed, and have their joints cracked, will presently have all their teeth drawn and put in again, once a week &mdash; say on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, when they are tired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> Seriously, however, the improvements in dental mechanism are perhaps the most appreciable signs of modern surgical progress that we possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Comparatively few enjoy the latest discoveries in cutting off legs and the like, while almost all are worried about their teeth, at <num value="1">one</num> time or another; but now <q>&#x0022;sans teeth&#x0022;</q> will be no sign of age to those who can afford to buy a new set Health, comfort, appearance are alike improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>It is no small matter to be able to procure a useful ornament and a wholesome luxury at <num value="1">one</num> purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>The demand for teeth is rapidly increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>Immense numbers are made of a mineral compound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/><num value="1">One</num> wholesale dentist I know of employs more than <num value="90">ninety</num> persons in manufacturing either them or things pertaining to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>The daily tale of teeth there produced is more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num>.--Teeth made of this material, however, are able to break, under some circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Having myself twice smashed some mineral grinders, my dentist said, looking at the fracture; <q>&#x0022;Ah, I see; you must have some hippopotamus teeth!&#x0022;</q> Retaining a vivid recollection of the effect when that gentleman in the tank at the <rs>Zoological Gardens</rs> looks cut of the water, and smiles, I said, <q> &#x0022;Ah!&#x0022;</q> rather dubiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>But he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>Many teeth are supplied by the hippotamus; mine are excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>I am given to understand that those which have done service already in some native human skull are less used than they were; but <num value="1">one</num> would think they must be the best, after all, if it were not for the idea of imperfect cannibalism which they suggest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/> <num value="1">One</num> great objection to the present operations in dental surgery, is their expense &mdash; at least where teeth have to be replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Young dentists, who want practice, are happy to draw teeth <hi rend="italics">in forma pauperis.</hi> By an inverse application of the law. <q> &#x0022;you must not look a gift horse in the mouth&#x0022;</q> the unhappy gratis patient who has had a molar broken off short half-way in the process of abstruction, may be expected, if not to thank his executioner, at least to obtain from a personal assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>You may get your teeth drawn, every <num value="1">one</num>, for next to nothing, if not for nothing itself; but when gaps in the series have to be filled up, it is quite another thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>At present, gold is required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Thus, the poor man cannot avail himself of the advance in dental mechanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Lately, however, a new material has been discovered, called vulcanite &mdash; a preparation of India-rubber, which is so successful as probably to supersede gold.--At present, it is expensive, but before long must necessarily afford much cheaper relief than the material now employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>It is very possible, however, to replace, for all practical purposes, very considerable chasms in the grinders with gutta-percha; and the best of it is, it the dentists will permit me to say so, that it is capable of application by the patient himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Front-teeth cannot be thus replaced; but suppose a man has lost <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of his back ones, and cannot afford to have them supplied by a dentist I would advise him to act thus: Let him take a lump of gutta-percha (white is the best, because it <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> is sweater than the brown) about as big as a walnut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Warm it thoroughly in boiling water till it is as soft as puffy; then, putting it into his mouth, let him bite it well into the gap, and keep his teeth closed till the gutta-percha cools; this will oblige him to shut his mouth for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3minutes" type="date">three minutes</measure>; then let him open it carefully, and take the lump out; he has only to trim it down with his penknife, and he will be fitted with an excellent substitute for regular <rs n="artificial teeth" type="product">artificial teeth</rs>, which will serve him well for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>This is no theory, but a proved fact; and I can only account for its not being more generally known and realized, by its interference with the regular business of the profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Forgive, dear reader, my entering into details; but the presence of jagged stumps rather assists this operation than other wise, for they steady the gutta-percha superstructure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Already this material is recognized as capable of a popular self-application in the matter of stopping teeth, for it is sold in small lumps about the size used for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>The white, I repeat, is the best and purest; though cheap, it is much dearer-than the dark material used for piping and the soles of shoes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/> Eventually, however, I have no doubt but that the new stuff, vulcanite, will enable the poor man to recover so necessary an assistance to health as teeth are admitted to be. I remember the time when Lucifers were a great curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Once, distinctly, I recollect when I was a little boy, seeing a gentleman, who was inquisitive about the latest discoveries in science, take <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> Lucifers out of a case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>After his showing and explaining them, it appeared that at the end of each match there was a small glass tube filled with some phosphoric compound, which, on being crushed, produced a flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>This process was effected by nipping the end with a pair of pliers, carried in the pocket for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>Altogether, it was a novel but very circuitous business, and seemed little likely to supersede the old tinder-box and brimstone-match.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>Its chief drawback, however, was its expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>I forget what this gentleman said he had given for the matches he exhibited, but now you can get <measure n="2boxes" type="mass">two boxes</measure> for <num value="0.5">a half</num>-penny. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/> Probably, before very long, dental hospitals will be able to afford relief to the poor by means of the material lately discovered, and replace, at a cheap rate, those necessary stones of the mill through which our food must be passed before it can replenish the washing fabric of our frames.--<hi rend="italics">Chamber's Journal.</hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
