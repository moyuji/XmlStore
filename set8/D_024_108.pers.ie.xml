The contest was renewed on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and the enemy &#x0022;was dislodged from all his positions around <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, and driven back to wards the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>,&#x0022; over which he was retreating when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> wrote his dispatch &mdash; at what hour on Sunday the paper itself does not show. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Ere this goes to press we may have further particulars of this triumph, inferior in importance to none of the very many which have crowned the arms of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>With only the brief message of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to inform us everybody knows the victory is great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>That distinguished military leader, whose modesty is equal to his merits, and <num value="1">one</num> of whose prominent traits is his conscientiousness, would never say <q>&#x0022;We have again to thank Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for a great victory,&#x0022;</q> until the triumph was of a character to make the announcement most scrupulously and religiously true to the letter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> This great combat, so glorious for Southern valor, contending, as it was, with the odds of numbers and superior appliances and enginery of war, must, of course, have a name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is either to take that of &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>&#x0022; or &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,7017622" n="1.000 715" reg="wilderness, spotsylvania, virginia">Wilderness</placeName>.&#x0022; The latter would not be inappropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It was &#x0022;out of the <rs>Wilderness</rs>&#x0022; that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,James,E.,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> drove the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>: equally merciful beasts of prey and plunder choose the <rs>Wilderness</rs> for a hiding place from which to descend upon the flocks and herds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>To seek them there and end their depredations is the part of the sagacious, practiced, and brave hunter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,James,E.,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> is just such a hunter of the hordes which are infesting the homes, the garners, and fields of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He crashed upon them in the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, killing and wounding and pursuing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Thus &#x0022;<persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,James,E.,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> drove the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> out of the <rs>Wilderness</rs>.&#x0022; </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The raid (Federal)</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are very imitative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Our cavalry raids have stimulated them to the effort at imitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They have displayed their ambition in this way in the <rs>Southwest</rs> much of late, and have at last achieved their greatest effort in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It has been more remarkable, however, for its boldness than its solid achievements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The <rs type="place">Central Road</rs> will be repaired and in running order for the entire line this morning as we learn, and the <rs type="place">Fredericksburg Road</rs> was ready for the cars yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Not a bridge worthy the name was destroyed; the most important that was attacked was the bridge across the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, on the <rs type="place">Fredericksburg Road</rs>, and that was but little injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Some culverts and cattle-stops were disarranged &mdash; nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The plan of destroying the aqueduct of the canal over the <rs>Rivanna</rs> was frustrated by <persName n="Lee,General,Fitzhugh,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Fitzhugh</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>That would have been a serious injury, and that was avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>So the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalryman, with his long sword, saddle, bridle, cavorting around, has done nothing &mdash; save to get away, for which he has to thank the stars, or somebody else. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Altogether, it is the most remarkable affair of the war. For deliberate, prolonged planning, elaborate equipment, and contemptible achievement; for the magnitude of its promises and the poverty of its performances, it is without parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is not in the nature of things that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> should achieve anything great on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He is like the beggar in the same situation, and when he mounts cannot tell where he will land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In his raid he seemed to have started for <num value="1">one</num> place and went to another &mdash; he touched at the least important points of the railroad &mdash; he straggled about, map in hand, in a state of incertitude &mdash; he stumbled in the way of danger in a manner so disorderly and loitering that it is difficult to say whether he was bold or stupid, or whether he really desired to be taken prisoner and sent home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is shrewdly suspected that the latter feeling predominated in the bosoms of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid makers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They scattered about and lay in the woods, lazy and sleepy &mdash; they wandered almost within hail of the city, and shewed themselves, passively and inactively to our armed men. They seemed to invite arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In the accommodating spirit of the pigs in a famous <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> town, who ran about roasted, with knives and forks in their backs, crying &#x0022;come eat me,&#x0022; they seemed to cry out &#x0022;come and take us, and relieve us from the fatigues of this horrid raid!&#x0022; If such were indeed their desires, they were doomed to go away unsatisfied &mdash; if such their expectations, to be sadly disappointed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>What a pity the poor, wearied, and worn horsemen had to pursue their journey through the hot plains of the peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Out of common humanity somebody ought to have ordered or invited them to dismount and tarry awhile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Such a raid and such an escape have no parallel in history. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Connecting these <num value="2">two</num> events, the inference is fair that they are to compose and settle all possible disturbance that might originate from either between the <rs>Lion</rs> and Whatever sort of animal he be who is now a denizen of the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The detachments which were sent down several miles below <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, to day a number of pontoon bridges, as if for the crossing of the whole army there, were evidently employed to divert the attention of the enemy from the main design of crossing above, and this stratagem no doubt contributed largely to the passage of the river at the several crossings above almost without a show of resistance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The main body of the army was thus rapidly marching southward, several of the advanced corps having crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, and the alternative was thus presented to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> of instantly coming out of his defences for battle, or for a rapid retreat to secure his roads to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> But, as the enemy appear to have had at none of the crossings of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> any protecting force beyond a line of pickets and a squad or <num value="2">two</num> of riflemen, is it not possible that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, anticipating this flank movement of <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, may have played upon him the old rebel game of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.
