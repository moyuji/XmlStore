<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Up to the time of writing, no official advices have been received in relation to this expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>We learn from unofficial sources that a heavy column of the enemy, consisting of infantry, artillery and cavalry, left our <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> front at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, moving down the <name>Jerusalem</name> plankroad, and were reported on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> to be at <placeName reg="Proctor's mill">Proctor's mill</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> <offset>south</offset> of  <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> Since that time they were not heard from till yesterday morning, when the information above mentioned was received here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>This column of the enemy is said to connect mostly of infantry, from which it is inferred to be simply a raiding party, similar to the <num value="1">one</num> which visited Stony <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> last week, and that it is not prepared for a protracted and extensive expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>There are, however, those who fear it is a movable column, destined to operate <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> against <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>, and then, perhaps, to continue its march and take <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It is useless to speculate upon their plans, which will be fully known in a day or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is probable that the primary object of the movement was to occupy the road, or so injure it as to prevent our sending any reinforcements to our forces operating against <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> It is utterly impossible for me to understand the logic which exempts State officers who are not necessary for the <rs>State Government</rs>; and yet it is the fact that the judges are undertaking to turn loose from the grasp of military authority, men without any duty to perform, upon the ground that they are officers provided by the constitution and the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>There are some <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> counties of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> within the enemy's lines, most of them under a regular government of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The State officers therein have been &mdash; where loyal, of course, --expelled from office, and are refuges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Most of them have acquired new homes and formed new social and business relations, and may not return to their counties until this war shall terminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Many will never return, even with peace; and it may be a question, if they should do so, whether they would have a right to resume their offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Under the laws and the constitution, the counties will average about <num value="60">sixty</num> officers, furnishing within the enemy's lines a number equal to about <num value="2000">two thousand</num>, constituting a force sufficient, it may be, to turn the tide of a great battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Yet, according to the decisions of some of the judges, these officers would be exempt from military duty, although without civil duties to perform, and with a great probability that they will have none during the continuance of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> * * * * * * * * </p> 
<p>The doctrine contended for may lead to the most fatal results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>If all the officers designated in the constitution, and in the laws made in pursuance thereof, are to be exempted because they are State officers &mdash; if all the justices of the peace, who, by the bye, were never exempted until the <date value="1862-10-01">1st of October, 1862,</date> having from the revolution to that period been required to perform military duty &mdash; if all sheriffs and clerks, and their deputies &mdash; all commissioners of the revenue &mdash; all surveyors and commonwealth's attorneys &mdash; all constables and overseers of the poor &mdash; all county agents for supplying soldiers' families &mdash; all salt agents, commercial agents, etc. --all employees of banks, cities, towns, etc., are to be exempt indiscriminately, and without reference to their necessity, then, indeed, in the language of the decision so frequently quoted, &#x0022;the spectacle might be presented of a nation subjugated and destroyed at a time when it had within its limits citizens amply sufficient to defend it against all the assaults of its enemies, but whose services could not be commanded because, forsooth, the <rs>Government</rs> had contracted with them that they should not be required to serve in the army.&#x0022; So far, in this State, the number of exempts is comparatively small; but in other States we are told it is widely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>At this time a powerful army of the enemy is sweeping over the <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">State of Georgia</placeName>, in which, under the doctrine contended for, there is now an army of exempts &mdash; exempts because officers and employees of the <rs>State Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> At this time the pressure of the service inspires a very common desire to escape from it; and the remedy by <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> designed for extraordinary acts of official tyranny or individual acts of oppression, is daily resorted to, to extricate the citizen from the holy duty of defending the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Lawyers of every degree his to the rest thus spread before them, and judges, in chambers and in court, feel <unclear>enstrained</unclear> to apply the principles of the writ to these but little better than moral deserters from the <unclear> </unclear> of their country; and at a time, too, when she is struggling in a death-grapple with her gigantic foe. * * * * * * </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> Has the time arrived when this issue is fairly before us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Is it, indeed, liberty and independence, or subjugation, which is presented to us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>A man must be blind to current events; to the gigantic proportions of this war; to the proclamations of the enemy; who does not see that the issue above referred to is presented <hi rend="italics">now.</hi> And, I repeat, the only question is, has the time arrived?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Are we able, beyond a question, to wage successful war against power <num value="3">three</num> times our own in numbers, with all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from which to recruit, and who unhesitatingly put arms in the hands of our own negroes for our destruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>I will not say that, under the <rs>Providence</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we may not be able to triumph; but I do say that we should not, from any mawkish coilability, refuse any means within our reach which will rend to enable us to work out our deliverance <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> for my part, standing before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and my country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>I do not hesitate to say that I would arm such portion of our able-bodied slave population as may be necessary and put them in the field, so as to have them ready for the spring campaign, even if it resulted <hi rend="italics">in the freedom of those thus organized.</hi> Will I not employ them to fight the negro force of the enemy; aye, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves, who already boast that they have <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> of our slaves in arms against us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Can we hesitate &mdash; can we doubt &mdash; when the question is, whether our enemy shall use our slaves against us, or we use them against him &mdash; when the question may be between liberty and independence on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, or our subjugation and utter ruin on the other? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> I am aware that a clamor has been raised against the policy of putting the negroes into the army by good and loyal men, because, they say, &#x0022;The end is not yet&#x0022;--that our army of citizen soldiers is still competent to make good our defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>No <num value="1">one</num> would advocate the policy of thus appropriating our slaves except as a matter of urgent necessity; but, as public opinion is widely divided on this subject, does not common prudence require us to fear that those opposed to this extremes measure may be mistaken?--Suppose it should so turn out, how deep would be their responsibility to the country, to freedom and independence everywhere!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>I know it is the opinion of some of the highest military authorities that the time has come when we should call our slaves to our assistance; and I hold it to be clearly the duty of every citizen, however much he may doubt the wisdom and necessity of the policy, to co- operate in strengthening, by every means, our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>I repeat, I know this policy is looked to with anxiety by some of the ablest military men of the age, who believe that it is of the last importance that it should be adopted without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>I therefore earnestly recommend to the <name>Legislature</name> that they should give this subject early consideration and enact such measures as their wisdom may approve. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>I know this policy is destined to meet a stout resistance; but fully impressed with its great importance, under existing circumstances, I may be pardoned, I hope, for pressing it upon your attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> I felt myself at liberty, shortly after your adjournment, in consequence of the failure of the bill making an appropriation to engage in the acquisition of supplies, for want of a constitutional, not a numerical majority, under the crying necessities and sufferings of the people for bread, etc., to use such portion of the contingent fund under my control as would partially relieve their wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>With this fund, and means otherwise acquired, I engaged in this business, and am gratified to believe that I contributed considerate amount of relief to the destitute families of soldiers and other suffering poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Among the articles purchased was about <measure n="300000l." type="pounds"><num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> of rice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>At the time I got it to this market, the retail price of the grocers was <measure n="2.5dollars" type="currency">two dollars and a half</measure> per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>This price, extortionate in a high degree, was the practical result of untrammeled competition under the laws of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>By my purchase I was enabled to put it upon the market, under certain restrictions as to the quantity to be purchased, at <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> per pound, which covered the cost and all expenses, including a small advance to provide against accidental losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>This involves the principle of the maximum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The same result occurred in the corn I bought and distributed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>I sold <num value="1">one</num> large lot at <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> a bushel, even sending a considerable quantity to the county of <placeName reg="Tazewell, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002192">Tazewell</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The effect of this would be to reduce the price of gold at once to that standard as a maximum, which would necessarily involve a reduction in the prices of all commodities, thereby securing a general benefit to every individual in the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The question will naturally be asked, how is the gold to be obtained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The reply is easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It is known that our State banks have a large amount of specie on hand entirely unproductive, not even contributing to sustain their credit, and a source of constant anxiety to the officers in charge of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>In this state of things, the banks, I have no doubt, would cheerfully surrender their specie to the <rs>State</rs> upon her obligation to return it at the end of the war, and the assignment of the tax in kind certificates of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, issued to the <rs>State</rs> from time to time, for the currency which she might acquire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The faith of the <rs>State</rs>, with this collateral security, would, I am persuaded, be entirely acceptable to the banks under the circumstances which imperil us. Should we triumph in our present struggle, which I doubt not, the security would be ample, and should we fail, of course the security would be valueless and all would be lost, except in the diffusive benefit to the people from the circulation of the coin now excluded from all useful purposes. </p> </div4>

<head>Conclusion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> I have now, gentlemen of the <name>Assembly</name>, frankly presented to you my views upon all measures to which I deem it necessary to invite your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>I cannot hope that you will concur with me entirely; but no measure has been suggested which, after careful consideration, does not strongly impress me as either necessary to the improvement of our condition or calculated to strengthen our hands in the fearful struggle in which we are now engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Our national life depends in no slight degree upon the separate action of the several States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; and I would not have our beloved State, in any of her departments, to betray a want of purest and highest heroism in her official conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Let us, gentlemen, remember, in the eloquent language of our Court of Appears, that &#x0022;the obligation of the citizen to render military service is a paramount social and political duty,&#x0022; and pass all laws which are necessary to give a military organization to our whole people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If, in any propose measure, we doubt our power or its propriety, let us remember that it is a well-established rule of construction, &#x0022;that all grants of privileges and exemptions from general burdens are to be construed liberally in favor of the public, and strictly as against the grantee.&#x0022; </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>
