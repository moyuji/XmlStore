<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --It is melancholy to read the complaints made by the <rs>Northern</rs> prisoners who have returned home of the inhospitable treatment they received in the <rs>Sunny South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In a land vertebral for its kindness to strangers they anticipated a very different reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Having always been welcomed with warm hearts and open arms to the best place at the <rs>Southern</rs> land they are intensely astonished that, when they undertook to save their quondam entertainers all trouble by helping themselves to whatever they had, they have not fared as well as when they left them the privilege of inviting their guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Their complaints are various and uttered with a plaintive yelp, like log who has gone in quest of bones and encountered a brickbat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>, for example, who is at present occupying a commodities call in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, is distressed that received no spiritual consolation in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The prisoners in New Orleans are mostly outraged that the ladies are not permitted to visit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Whilst others who have gone North from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> have filled the incredulous ear of the <rs>Northern</rs> multitude with the most astounding tales of the barbarities practised upon them in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is needless to say that there is not a particle of truth on these stories; and that, except the necessary restriction upon their liberty, they have seen, in all respects, as comfortable as could be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They have had better food to eat than was furnished them in their own army, and they have been lodged in spacious tobacco factories, which, during the summer months, are as cool and well ventilated buildings as can be had in the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and which command a fine prospect of the beautiful country which they had come to savage and despoil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>When their situation is contrasted with the horrible treatment of the <rs>Confederate</rs> prisoners in <placeName reg="Columbus, Franklyn, Ohio" key="tgn,7013645">Columbus, Ohio</placeName>, and other Northern towns, the <rs>Federal</rs> captives have no right to be obstreperous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Think of such a man as <persName n="Thomas,Doctor,Hanson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Thomas,Hanson,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Hanson</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, confined in <num value="1">one</num> of the damp and narrow casemates of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>; of <persName n="Greenhow,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Greenhow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greenhow</surname></persName>, driven to the borders of insanity of brutal treatment in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and of hundreds of others, peaceable citizens, not soldier taken in battle, who have been visited with similar and even worse outrages, bashed, beaten, knocked down, and in some cases murdered, and the most embittered enemy, if he possessed a particle of candor, must concede that the <rs>Federal</rs> prisoners taken in battle have every reason to be grateful for the humanity they have received from the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Instead of this, however, they no sooner set foot again on their own soil than they invent the most scandalous falsehoods about their treatment in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They admit, we believe, that they had enough to eat and drink, but they consider it barbarous that they were denied delicacies and luxuries which few of our own people can obtain for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They seem to entertain no doubt of the fact that their merits entitle them to the same kind of reception that was tendered the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY7">New York Seventh Regiment</orgName> when it visited this city.--They consider it an example of flagrant injustice and partiality that we should not bestow upon the <name>Zouaves</name> of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> the same consideration which we tendered to the military shop-keepers of New York in a time of profound peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When a robber wakes you at night by his efforts to break into your dwelling, shoots various members of your family, and makes the most horrible threats against the safety and even purity of your dwelling, it is a most flagrant piece of barbarity to make him a prisoner, and put him in jail, instead of offering him the honors of your mansion, giving him the best room, making haste to furnish him with spiritual consolation, and not forgetting those spirituous appliances which gentlemen of his profession never fail to appreciate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> In like manner, those heroes of the handcuff and halter, who came all the way from New York and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> with the avowed purpose of destroying our lives, robbing us of our property, and perpetrating crimes worse than death upon helpless women, ought to be lodged at the <rs type="place">Spotswood House</rs>, or Exchange, instead of tobacco factories, be fed upon venison and oysters and champagne, visited by the ladies, have the benefit of clergy, and be caressed, petted, soothed, and solaced in every conceivable manner for the melancholy disappointment <date value="07-21"> on the 21st of July,</date> and various other occasions, of their cherished plans for the extermination of the <rs>Southern</rs> race, the spoliation of Southern property, and the defilement of every Southern hearthstone. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> We are in favor of humanity to prisoners, even under the aggravating circumstances of provocation to their annihilation which the infamous Lincoln Government is furnishing every day. But beyond the strict requirements of civilized warfare we should not be inclined to travel very far with the most uncivilized of enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>They should not be permitted any of the luxuries which they claim except those of a spiritual sort, which, it must be confessed, they stand more in need of than any others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In charity to their souls, which are in greater peril than their bodies, we would let them have as many clergymen as they desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It would, moreover, be an excellent school of practice for those of our young divines who intend to become missionaries among the <name>Camanche</name>, <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnees</rs>, and Barbarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A clergyman who could reclaim a New York Zouave might have no difficulty in evangelizing a whole continent of cannibals, and would soon eclipse the fame of <persName n="Xavier,,St. Francis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Xavier,St. Francis,,,"><foreName>St. Francis</foreName> <surname>Xavier</surname></persName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Many persons suppose that such would be the result, but we have no belief in anything of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Nothing but the most abject fear of the power of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and the thorough conviction of the inability of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in its present condition to cope with such an adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> only goes to war when it outnumbers its enemy <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num> on land, and when its enemy has no force at all at sea. Unable to conquer even with such odds, and with its treasury and honor both bankrupt, nothing short of actual invasion, even if that could have the effect, would induces it to take up arms against <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We believe that those powers might not only recognize the <rs>South</rs>, but open the <name>Stockade</name>, without danger of an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war. The blockade has already been proved inefficient, and <num value="1">one</num> which by the laws of nation they are not obliged to regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The interests of their subjects and of the whole civilized world imperatively demand that the <name>Blockade</name> should cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> --<num value="2">Two</num> items of intelligence have recently appeared in which the individual facetiously called by our jolly neighbors of the <rs>North</rs> <q>&#x0022;contraband,&#x0022;</q> figured largely, and in a manner incompatible with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ideas of the duty and inclination of that individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>A letter from a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invader of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> describes the unfortunate expedition of a detachment of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Wool,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="mostcommon:Wool,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wool</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> in the ill-fated rout of <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2016605;tgn,2036878" n="0.136 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.091 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America">Bethel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Among the direful incidents of the expedition was the encountering of a regiment of blacks, who <q>&#x0022;actually attacked, fired on, and wounded, the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>.&#x0022;</q> The writer says he had heard of negro regiments at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and New Orleans, <q>&#x0022;but did not believe it until it came so near home,&#x0022;</q> and their men were attacked by the contraband!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Of course, all that this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> says about a negro regiment is false; but his statement will be startling to the <rs>Northern</rs> fanatics who have waged this war for the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>They will consider him an ingrate and a base being after all ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> It so happens, however, as we are enabled to state on the authority of an eye witness, that, in the particular fight referred to, there was <num value="1">one</num> negro, and only <num value="1">one</num>, in the <rs>Southern</rs> ranks, and hence the story that there was a regiment!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Well, this is moderate, considering that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts have generally no foundations at all. The loyal <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> referred to was a good shot, and as he <q>&#x0022;drew a bead&#x0022;</q> on his gun not less than <num value="30">thirty</num> times, it is probable that he abolished at least that number of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and that they might have reasonably imagined that a whole negro regiment was firing into them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>We have no doubt that everything about the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> looked very black just at that time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> There is another pleasant bit of news to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> recently received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/><num value="2">Two</num> men enlisted in a Canada regiment (the <num value="100" type="ordinal">100th</num>) at <placeName key="tgn,7013284" n="1.000 41" reg="toronto,toronto metropolitan area,ontario,canada,north and central america">Toronto</placeName>, and after making drawings of the fortifications there attempted to escape to <placeName reg="Rochester, Monroe, New York" key="tgn,7014348">Rochester, New York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They were immediately pursued by a negro, who had watched them, and a white man in a boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Being overhauled, they refused to submit, and the negro fired on them with a gun loaded with buckshot, wounding both badly, after which they were <unclear></unclear> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> <unclear></unclear> reports are not at all likely to cause <unclear></unclear> respect for the negro among the <unclear></unclear> who already <unclear></unclear> more of the sable <unclear> </unclear> they know what to do <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>They had worshipped the negro until <num value="1">one</num> would suppose they would almost esteem it a luxury to be beaten by him &mdash; that a flagellation inflicted by his adorable hands would by no means interrupt their love, their devout intercession for his beatification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>But our <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldier says <q>&#x0022;It is time that this thing was understood!&#x0022;</q> And we suppose the negro thinks so, too. He has no idea of being transferred from good homes and abundance to be placed under <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> taskmasters, on half rations; and after a term of servitude in this way to those worst of masters, to be colonized in some Utopia, where he will have neither bread, nor meat, nor home, nor anything to make life happy, and where a speedy death would be the most welcome event. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> A most fearful railroad accident occurred early yesterday morning on the <orgName n="Delaware Railroad" type="railroad">Delaware Railroad</orgName>, just where the track crosses the canal, near <placeName reg="Kirkwood, New Castle, Delaware" key="tgn,2017971">St. George's Station</placeName>, by which <num value="7">seven</num> persons lost their lives, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> were more or less injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>A wood train, consisting of <num value="13">thirteen</num> platform cars, empty, and <num value="1">one</num> old passenger, in which the conductor, <persName n="Butler,Mister,Albert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="default:Butler,Albert,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, and some <num value="20">twenty</num> laborers were seated, went down the <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> road for a load of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>When the train reached the high bridge which spans the canal, lear <placeName reg="Kirkwood, New Castle, Delaware" key="tgn,2017971">St. George's Station</placeName>, the draw of the bridge was discovered to be open, but the discovery came too late to stop the train, the ice on the road preventing it, and it was precipitated into the canal, a descent of about <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure>. Car, upon car was piled in pieces upon each other, crushing a number of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The conductor was fortunately standing outside of the car, and seeing the train was about to make the fearful plunge, jumped off and escaped, but he had no time to warn the workmen in the car, and the entire number were seen mixed with the ruins in the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The engineer of the train was killed instantly, as well as the fireman. </p> 
<p>
