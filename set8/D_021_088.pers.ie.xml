<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> To-day the enemy commenced the long expected attack on <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The bombardment was opened about <time value="6am">6 A. M.</time>, and during the forenoon continued without intermission, the fire being quite rapid, and the explosion of the shells audible and visible throughout the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>until this hour, (<time value="4pm">4 P. M.</time>,) the firing is still kept up, but the intervals are greater, and apparently the range is batter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>From the lower part of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, the bursting of the shells high in mid air, and the condensed volume of vapor from them, could be plainly seen by the numerous spectators, who thronged every commanding position from which the engagement could be witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>At <num value="1">one</num> moment several explosions could be seen, as if the fire proceeded from different positions, and again some minutes would elapse before the sulphurous cloud would be again observed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The distance from the city, as the crow files, to <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Pulaski</placeName>, must be <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure>, and a wall- wooded point of land, not more than <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from the city, intervenes to obstruct the view; over this point the shells could be distinctly perceived bursting high in mid air, which could not have resulted from any but inexperienced gunners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> It is very likely that the effort of the morning was especially devoted to finding the proper ranges and elevation, as the effect was much better during the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I have been informed that from observation at <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Fort Jackson</placeName>, <num value="5">five</num> Federal <orgName n="Mortar Battery" type="battery">mortar batteries</orgName> opened on the fort from diverse points; the garrison of <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName> were replying cautiously and with precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is impossible to tell when any information can be received from the fort; no doubt the <rs>Federal</rs> force will be more watchful now to intercept any communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We have no fears of the present safety of the fort, but how long this state of stringent blockade may last, and a galling and harassing fire of the enemy be kept up, no <num value="1">one</num> can answer for, nor for the contingencies that are possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Yesterday we had a very heavy rain shower, such as seldom occurs at this season; but it has been opportune for the garrison, since a month of dry weather must have lowered their cisterns considerably.--Why the fort has not been supplied with condensers, I have not been able to learn; nor are there many who appear to think sufficiently of the importance of the matter of a good supply of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, within the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and easily communicated with in case of a naval attack, has been so supplied by the foresight of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, and the sinking of an artesian well has been attempted, and is now progressing, with every chance of an adequate supply from it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <persName n="Lawton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lawton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lawton</surname></persName> went down to the <rs>Fort</rs> [Jackson, not <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName>] to observe the progress of the engagement, and came back again well satisfied, no doubt, with the judgment displayed by the besieged in replying so deliberately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Should any further accounts arrive of the effect of the enemy's fire, I shall not fall to write. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The enemy ascended <placeName reg="Mud River, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2529856">Mud River</placeName> a few days ago and threw a number of shell at the batteries in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Fort Jackson</placeName>, but elicited no reply, as all fell short, and it would have been into to expose the nature and range of our guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The Federal lies which have lately found their way South are as huge as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Their late successes in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> appear not to have rendered them a article more magnanimous, but they lie to the furthest stretch of their ability to add <num value="1">one</num> cubic more to their vanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The reporter who detailed the account of the expedition to <placeName reg="Thunderbolt battery">Thunderbolt battery</placeName>, which he so accurately places at <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName></placeName>, and a fine shell road sending to it, and which he declared was destroyed, the magazine exploded, and the guns spiked, would be in a very hot place should be venture near the dismantled ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>No <num value="1">one</num> hereabouts has been able to guess where the scenes of the other exploits he reports can be. It no doubt was made up to fill the fancy sketch with which he wished to delight his <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">Gotham</placeName> admirers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> A large rifle gun, the manufacture of the <orgName n="Tredegar Works" type="works">Tredegar Works</orgName>, burst on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, at <placeName reg="Cansten's Bluff">Cansten's Bluff</placeName>, shattering the leg of <num value="1">one</num> private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This gun has been held in much respect, for it was hoped that the <rs>Federal</rs> battery on <placeName reg="Cakland Island">Cakland Island</placeName> might be dislodged with it, as it possessed a range of nearly <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>. It is a great loss at this time, and can distributed to nothing else than the defective shot which had been prepared for it; the lead around the bass of the shot was prepared to fit the grooves of the gun, and could be forced down only by great exertion on the part of the gunner, and when rapidly fired no certainty of its having been sent home could be felt, save by measurement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This vacuum in the gun caused it to burst; only a day before orders had been given to change the shot, as it was considered dangerous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The draft of last <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> proved, like the preceding <num value="1">one</num> of the <date value="03-04">4th of March,</date> a failure, the quota of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> not being made up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It must not be supposed that <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> is unpatriotic, or has <unclear></unclear> in her duty; she has now in the service <num value="43">forty-three</num> companies, numbering <num value="3600">thirty-six hundred</num> men; while, her voting population is only <num value="2600">twenty-six hundred</num> enrolled, and has never gone beyond <num value="2200">twenty-two hundred</num> polled at the most favorable time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The commercial communities of this country have always been the object of attack by the country representation in our Legislatures, which appears to be supremely ignorant of the advantages which they and their section derive from their extended facilities of intercourse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The Governor, to-morrow, will, through <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Thomas,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, proclaim martial law, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">1st regiment of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName></orgName> militia will be recruited <foreign lang="fre"><num value="6">VI</num> at armies</foreign>by raising all who promenade the streets, and, placing arms in their hands, compel them to serve their country.

<head>Their Real purposes.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> That any man should put faith in the <unclear>pa </unclear> and honorable intentions which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> profess, in the event of our submission to their benignant rule, in <num value="1">one</num> of the most amazing instances of human credulity that the world has ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The poor bird who has been charmed by the festinating gaze of a serpent does not show greater weakness and folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>If this war has proved anything, it has proved that not <num value="1">one</num> word our enemies say is to be relied upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Truth, never having a very vigorous root in their section, seems to have fallen into utter disrepute since the beginning of this war. At no time an object of idolatry, it has been so kicked and cuffed about by them, under the agreeable rule that deception in war is perfectly allowable, that its best friends would not know it from a lie. Truth is a deity which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, even in peace, never allowed a place in their Pantheon, but in this war it has never been brought out, except as <unclear>Qulip,</unclear> when in a bad humor, brought out the wooden effigy of the admiral, to punch a hole in its cheeks, or clip off a piece of its nose, or put out its eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>If there is anything in the world they seem to have a special spite against, it is Truth, which they hate worse than slavery, and never so much as look at, except by accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Any <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> who could be suspected of giving a truthful account of <num value="1">one</num> battle that has occurred in this war, or an accurate statement of the character of any man engaged in it, or a candid opinion of its probable character and objects, would be instantly sent to <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>All <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is struck dumb with their mendacity, which is said to have excited more horror even than slavery among the Old World abolitionists; and the <name>Chinese</name>, who have hitherto been considered the greatest liars in the world, are ashamed to show their faces in public, since the only quality in which they claimed pre-eminence above the rest of mankind, has been surpassed by the ambitious <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> If any sane man in the <rs>South</rs>, after the daily and hourly proofs of the total hollowness and falsehood of our enemies in this war, can still be deceived by their professions, his friends should institute a commission <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">de lunatico inquirendo</hi> </foreign> without further delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>What promise that they made have they kept Did not <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, at the beginning of the war, give the most solemn assurances to the <rs>Southern Commissioners</rs> that no reinforcements would be sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and that the <orgName n="U. S. Forces" type="org">United States forces</orgName> would be withdrawn, while at that very moment he was preparing to reinforce the fort to the <unclear> </unclear> extent of his power, and bring on a bloody and desolating war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Did he not deceive <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in the same manner, and by false assurances so completely win her confidence that she had well nigh fallen into the pit he had prepared for the common destruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>And, putting even this basalt of all Northern men out of the question, what has been the course of that party in the <rs>North</rs> which is most conservative, and which has always been loudest and most eloquent in its professions of love for the <rs>Constitution</rs> and justice to the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>They constitute at this moment the very backbone of this invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Without the money and political weight of cities which had hitherto professed to be conservative, the war, if it had ever begun, would long ago have come to an end. Where are the <name>Dickinson</name>, the <name>Everetts</name>, the <name>Cushings</name>, the <name>Dixes</name>, the <name>Butlers</name>, now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>What has become of principle, of consistency, of good faith, among those to whom the <rs>South</rs> once looked as a bulwark against the crusade of abolition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>With <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, the conservative politicians of the <rs>North</rs> have not only deserted us, but are urging on with might and main this desolating war, whilst the few good men in <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName>, who keep aloof from its iniquities, are overawed and crushed into silence and subjection by a tremendous military despotism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> The Lincoln Government promised to release our prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> on parole, and sent them to <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>They promised to exchange gallant privateers, whom they have kept ironed like criminals in loathsome cells since the beginning of this war; but as soon as they had succeeded in making a larger number of prisoners than those in our possession, they shamefully refused to keep their word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>They proclaimed safety and protection to the <rs>Southern</rs> region which should be occupied by their armies, and they have fulfilled their promise by destroying furniture, burning houses, arresting and imprisoning, and sometimes murdering in cold blood, peaceful and unoffending citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> and <persName n="Goldsborough,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Goldsborough,nomatch:0"><surname>Goldsborough</surname></persName> made a pompous proclamation on the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> that they came there with the most <rs>Christian</rs> and humans intentions, and followed it up by deliberately shelling a town full of women and children, without giving them an opportunity to escape, and even firing upon vessels which were carrying off the helpless and terror stricken fugitives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>And are we to believe such a people still, when they promise that, if we will only yield to their demands, we shall not surely die? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> The truth is, even if they were so disposed, they have no means of paying off their enormous debt without the wholesale <unclear>spoliation</unclear> and plunder of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Is any <num value="1">one</num> verdant enough to imagine that, if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> succeeds in our conquest, he is going to pay that debt himself, or any part of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The whole of more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>--the whole of it, to the last farthing &mdash; will be wrong from the vanquished in <num value="1">one</num> form or another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>If, ruined and bankrupted by defeat, it cannot be squeezed from us in any other way, it will come by the universal confiscation of all Southern property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Their army has already been promised a division among them of the fair fields of the <rs>South</rs>, and this is <num value="1">one</num> of the few promises made in this war which is intended to be kept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Cupidity, interest, revenge, all point alike to this inevitable conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The history of the whole <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> race is <num value="1">one</num> which gives no glimpse of hope that when the property of their neighbors is at their mercy justice or compassion will ever indues them to forego the opportunity of its appropriation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Their whole philosophy upon this subject is embraced in the resolutions adopted by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> settlers in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>. --<q>&#x0022;Resolved, That the earth belongs to the saints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Resolved, That we are the saints.&#x0022;</q> The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> were made to feel the practical operation of that philosophy to the confiscation of all they had and the extermination of their whole race, and the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>, by a more pacific, but equally unprincipled process, were <unclear></unclear> out of their possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The most instructive lesson, however, and <num value="1">one</num> which the <rs>South</rs> should solemnly ponder, is that quoted by the <orgName n="Richmond Whig" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi></orgName>, in reference to <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, which, our contemporary observes, was conducted on precisely the plans and with identically the same purposes which actuate our foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The reader will find the same treachery mark every step of his progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Soon after landing a powerful and well equipped army in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> published a proclamation, forbidding his soldiers, on pain of death, to hurt any of the inhabitants, or take anything <unclear>om</unclear> them, without paying for it in <unclear></unclear> This was so strictly extended that, even in his march from <placeName reg="Dublin, Pulaski, Virginia" key="tgn,2111523">Dublin</placeName> to <unclear>Droghoda,</unclear> where he was guilty of that horrid <unclear>butchary</unclear> [he took the place by storm, and, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> after having promised quarter, massacred all his prisoners,] and breach of faith before mentioned, he ordered <num value="2">two</num> of his private soldiers to be put to death in the face of the whole army, for stealing <num value="2">two</num> hens from an Irishman, which were not worth <measure n="2d." type="currency"><num value="2">two</num> pence</measure>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> <q>&#x0022;Upon this <unclear></unclear> observance of the proclamation, together with positive assurances given by his officers, that they were for the liberties of the <name>Commons</name> and that every <num value="1">one</num> should enjoy the freedom of his religion, and that those who served the market at the camp should pay no contribution, all the country people flocked to them with all kinds of provisions, and due payment being made for the same, his army was much better supplied than that of the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> ever had been.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> The conquest having been secured, the disguise is thrown off. <q>&#x0022;<date value="1652-09- 16">On the 16th September, 1652,</date> the <orgName n="English Parliament" type="parliament">English Parliament</orgName> declared that the rebels in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> were subdued and the rebellion ended, and thereupon proceeded to the distribution of their lands.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> The whole kingdom was surveyed, and the number of acres, taken with the quality of them, all the soldiers brought in their demands for <unclear></unclear> and each man received, by lot, as many notes as should answer the value of his demand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> The best land was rated only at <measure n="4s." type="currency"><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> an acre, and some only at a penny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The saluters drew lots on what part of the kingdom their lots should be assigned them.--Great abuse was committed in <unclear></unclear> out the adventurers' satisfaction for the money they had advanced at the beginning of the war; for they had whole baronies set out to them in gross, and they employed surveyors of their own to make their admeasurement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> What lands they were pleased to call unprofitable they returned as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The soldiers' land returned as unprofitable amounted to <unclear><num value="605810">605,810</num></unclear> acres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>In this manner was the whole kingdom divided between the soldiers and the adventurers of money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> and his Council, finding the utter extirpation of the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> nation to be in itself very difficult, and to carry in it somewhat of horror that made some impression upon the <unclear>stone-hardness</unclear> of their own hearts, after so many <num value="1000">thousands</num> destroyed by the sword, famine, and by the plague, and after so many transported into foreign parts, found out the following expedient of transportation, which they called <q>&#x0022;An Act of Grace:&#x0022; </q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> There was a large tract of country, even to the half of the province of Connaught, that was separated from the rest by a long and large river, and which, by the plague and many massacres, remained almost desolate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> Into this space they required all the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, whom <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> had declared innocent of the rebellion, to retire by a certain day under the penalty of death, and all who after that time should be found in any other part of the <name>Kingdon</name> &mdash; man, woman, or child &mdash; might be killed by any who saw or met them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> &#x0022;The land within this circuit, the most barren in the <name>Kingdom</name>, was, out of the grace and mercy of the conquerors, assigned to those of the nation who were enclosed in such proportions as might with great industry preserve their lives, and to those persons from whom they had taken great quantities of land in other provinces they assigned greater proportions within this, on condition that they should give releases of their former rights and titles, and bar themselves and hairs from ever laying claim to their old inheritance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> &#x0022;By this means the plantation, as they <unclear></unclear> it, was finished, and all the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> natives were enclosed within that circuit, the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> being left to the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Some few estate were left to the old proprietors, who, being all <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestants</rs>, had either never offended them or had served them, or had made compensation for their delinquencies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> &#x0022;The <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> were to confine themselves to Connaught, so that the new <name>English</name> planters might proceed, without interruption, and without that degradation, which former <unclear></unclear> had experienced from an intercourse with the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, and the natives, divided by the <rs>Shannon</rs> from the other Provinces, and surrounded by the <rs>English</rs> <unclear></unclear> might be restrained from their old barbarous incurious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> <q>&#x0022;These colonists were transported (to Connaught) without <unclear></unclear> to <unclear>ow,</unclear> cattle to stock, ploughs to cultivate, servants to <unclear></unclear> or houses to shelter them; they were not to settle within <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of the sea, <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> of the <rs>Shannon</rs></placeName>, or enter any garrisoned town without orders on peril of life.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> With truth, does the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs></hi> observe, that <q>&#x0022;from these instructive extracts we may read our own if we should yield either to the threats or promises of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The confiscation of lands, to be drawn for by lot among a licentious and foreign soldiery; the seizure of our country, schools, pulpits, with every State and local office by the most vicious and vindictive of our enemies; the lawless mixture of negroes, foreigners and fanatics, would so transform our once happy country that the doom of the poor <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> would be indeed an act of grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, seeing his country the home of rice, infidelity and enmity to all he reverences, would gladly go to any wilderness where his children might <unclear>forg </unclear> a country he could not rescue.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> Our only salvation from such a destiny is determined and eternal resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>There is no other possibility, no other hope of deliverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>And in that is certain redemption, victory, and retribution. </p> </div3>
