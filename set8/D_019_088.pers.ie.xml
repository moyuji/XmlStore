<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It might be important to preserve secrecy for the time as to the course which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Unquestionably, it discloses the true state of Northern public sentiment: </p> 
<div4 type="letter" n="1"> 
<head></head> <opener> <dateline> <placeName reg="Portland, Cumberland, Maine" key="tgn,7014272">Portland</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1861-04-06"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="6">6</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>. </dateline> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/> Some time ago I wrote you, and requested <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of my friends here to do so too, in answer to a letter of yours requesting my candid opinion as to the feeling of the people of this part of the country upon the subject of the differences between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Subsequent events, and more attentive observation on my part, have led me to think I gave you too favorable an account of the disposition of our people to do what you and I would consider no more than simple justice to the <rs>South</rs> in respect to their rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, particularly in the matter of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Public sentiment seems to be hardening into the determination to make no concession or compromise, but to maintain the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it is. The Abolitionists proper, and the <name>Abolitionized</name> <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, hope thus to limit and circumscribe the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, with the expectation of its final extinction under the influence, and, perhaps, by the direct action of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Another class (and it is by no means a small <num value="1">one</num>,) composed of men who never did comprehend the nature of our Government, in respect to its difference from an overshadowing centralized power, hold that now is the time, in view of the position the seceding States have assumed, to try the strength of the <rs>Government</rs>, or, in their own language, &#x0022;to see whether we have a Government or not.&#x0022; What the <rs>South</rs> can reasonably expect from the let-alone &#x0022;Constitution as it is&#x0022; party, you can judge as well as I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/></p> 
<p> The history of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> shows that its policy has been shaped to suit the anti- slavery sentiment of its members, who are the most earnest, and, consequently, the most active portion, the office-seeking partizans following them for the sake of the spoils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Indeed, <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> boasted not long since at a public meeting in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, that the <name>Abolitionists</name> had dictated its policy to the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.--And he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>If the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> is not a cheat, a sham, an infamous swindle, it is no more nor less than an <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Many of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>I am aware, repel with an honest indignation the charge of abolitionism as the characteristic, leading, cardinal principle of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, but they are not philosophical enough to discriminate closely as to the distinguishing principles of political parties &mdash; the animating spirit of political organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>They are in that party by the force of circumstance, and are not its leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>I do not think that any considerable portion of our people entertain feelings of hostility towards the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Their efforts are directed against the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, to effect its overthrow, at any cost to those directly interested in it, whom they would consider as in the predicament of persons losing their property by reason of an unlucky speculation or a bad investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>I am speaking of the sentiments of the people in this region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/><placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, I am sorry to say, shows no disposition to recede from her position upon that cunningly devised scheme of abolitionism, the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>We have not begun to feel in any considerable degree, owing to our pursuits and isolated geographical situation, the disastrous effects of disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>With the exception of the navigating interest, we live among ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Probably we should never feel very sensibly in our material interests a permanent disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>, save in the event of a consequent civil war Therefore, <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> will be slow to retrace her steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>For my own part, I despair of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>The Union, with all its memories and high hopes, is, I fear, irrevocably gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>People of such diverse views upon matters of vital importance, where unanimity of sentiment is absolutely essential, cannot, and perhaps ought not, to try to live together in <num value="1">one</num> family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>But enough of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>I am not giving you advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>You know better than I do what the <rs>South</rs> have reason to expect from other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>I pray that you may find good reason for believing that they are disposed to be more just in their views and determination, as to the rights of the <rs>South</rs>, than I can conscientiously say our people are. I pray, also, that you may exercise the highest human wisdom in the responsible position you have the honor to fill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Be good enough to write to me when you have leisure, and believe me, as ever, </p> <closer> <salute>Yours, very truly.</salute> </closer> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/> &#x0022;The war spirit, as it is called, is aroused; but where and against whom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>The war spirit of the <rs>North</rs>--that war spirit which it is so difficult to arouse against a foreign foe &mdash; is instantly inflamed against the members of our National household; against our own people, the common brotherhood of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>And for what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Not for an aggressive deed of war; not because of invasion; not because of design, or even declaration against rights of the <rs>North</rs>; but simply because they have captured a fortress within their own territory, under the menacing attitude, proceedings and preparations of a declared enemy to their rights and institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>They had been driven to that extremity in which they had to choose between silence and submission; and the strengthening of the hands of an enemy against them, and the attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/> &#x0022;With such facts as these, it is idle to talk of the <rs>South</rs> as having commenced the contest, or as deserving reproach for what they did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>And by this estimate they must be judged in this thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>For although the <name>Administration</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> does not regard them as a foreign foe, yet the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> constitute a nation, with its independence declared, and therefore they regard the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as a foreign foe.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Baltimore Sun"></bibl></cit> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/> Our city has been a continued scene of the wildest excitement to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>From the rising of this morning's sun to the going down of the same, there has been nothing but confusion and disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>From the suburbs to the centre of the city, among all classes, sexes, and even colors, has the same feeling been shared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>The desire to hear further news from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> has been intense, almost unbearable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>If the distance were not so great, and the expense so heavy, I doubt not many of the most excitable and enthusiastic would have packed up and started immediately after reading the dispatches conveying the intelligence of the commencement of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>Some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> gentlemen did, in fact, leave by this afternoon's train, among whom I may mention the name of our delegate in the <name>Legislature</name>, <persName n="Collier,,Charles,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="default:Collier,Charles,F.,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Collier</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, who goes, as I learn, for some other purpose than for mere observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>He would not forsake the <rs>Union</rs> he had loved so much and so long, until every honorable effort had been made, but in vain, to bring about a peaceful separation between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>But as soon as he found that the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> were but throwing away time, he threw the whole weight of his influence in favor of Southern rights, and has advocated the <rs>Southern</rs> cause with much eloquence and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>I hear that <persName n="Collier,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00394" reg="nearbymention:Collier,Charles,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Collier</surname></persName>'s chief reason for visiting the <rs>South</rs>, at present, is to offer to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> a company of <num value="100">100</num> chosen men, who are anxious to aid their brethren, by fighting with and for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>In case their services will be needed, the company will form immediately, with <persName n="Lewellen,,J.,Richard,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00395" reg="default:Lewellen,J.,Richard,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Lewellen</surname></persName>, a brave officer, formerly in the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war, and proceed directly to their destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>If their services were desired, I believe that at least <num value="1000">1,000</num> strong, active men, in this city alone, would most willingly volunteer for the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/> The weather has been showery and sunshiny alternately to-day, and the temperature has been very mild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Accordingly, the guns of the <orgName n="Artillery Company" type="company">Artillery company</orgName> were procured, and a large escort accompanied them across to the <name>Amherst</name> side of the river, and up to the top of a mountain, about half a mile distant, and in full view of the city, where the salutes were fired, and a happy time generally ensued. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/> New mail agents have been appointed on the <rs type="place">Virginia and Tennessee Road</rs>. <num value="2">Two</num> of them have entered on their official duties.--They reached this city on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, totally worn out, and very tired of their undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>They got the cat in the bag, and are very tired of the office &mdash; acknowledge themselves totally incompetent to discharge the duties &mdash; have nobody to instruct them &mdash; the mails are all in confusion &mdash; along the line of the road everybody gives them the cold shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>They indicate their intention to get rid of the job.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/> On yesterday evening the flag of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was hoisted in front of the locomotive attached to the mail train on the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee Railroad</orgName>, which carried the news of the surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>. <persName n="Owen,Colonel,R.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00398" reg="default:Owen,R.,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Owen</surname></persName>, the <rs>President</rs> of that road, and <persName n="Gill,,E.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00399" reg="default:Gill,E.,H.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Gill</surname></persName>, the <rs n="General Superintendent" type="misc">General Superintendent</rs>, are strong friends and staunch advocates of Southern rights, and so far as I am informed their road has been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to raise the <rs>Southern</rs> flag.
