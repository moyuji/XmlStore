<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> &#x0022;I forbear giving a more detailed account, and will proceed to mention briefly the contents of the space above the head of the corpse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>A quantity of the equisetum like herb sustains uninjured an amphora of coarse earthenware, with a yellow, vitreous glaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The handles and neck are broken off, and inside it is placed &mdash; also with packing &mdash; a beautifully-executed cinerary urn of red Semain ware, containing ashes and a small roll of vellum, covered with characters which I am unable to decipher, but which I believe to be <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Sprinkled through the scroll I, however, find the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> name &#x0022;<persName n="Sulpicious,,Q.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="default:Sulpicious,Q.,,,"><foreName>Q.</foreName> <surname>Sulpicious</surname></persName>, <persName n="Piso,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Piso,nomatch:0"><surname>Piso</surname></persName>, &#x0022; the initials &#x0022;S. P. Q. R.,&#x0022; the words &#x0022;legatus,&#x0022; &#x0022;crematio,&#x0022; &#x0022;manes,&#x0022; &#x0022;lares,&#x0022; and a few others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>This scroll I therefore imagine to hold the key of the enigma presented by the many anomalous appearances I have described and am about to describe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> &#x0022;In the amphora, beneath the urn, are a number of ornaments of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, such as were worn by <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> females of rank; among them is a kind of rude locket, containing a long tress of glossy yellow hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The ornaments appear to be a set, as if they had belonged to <num value="1">one</num> person; and this fact, coupled with the presence of the hair, leads me to suppose the ashes contained in the urn to be those of the owner both of them and the hair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> &#x0022;The amphora also contains a small packet of coins, nearly <num value="100">one hundred</num> in number, of which <num value="43">forty-three</num> are gold, and of the reigns of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> emperors Honorins, dating A. D. <dateStruct value="410"><year reg="410">410</year></dateStruct>, a few of <persName><foreName>Hadrian</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Antonius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Antonius,nomatch:0"><surname>Antonius</surname></persName> and <persName n="Severus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Severus,nomatch:0"><surname>Severus</surname></persName>, with earlier dates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The remaining coins are silver, probably <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName>, but owing to their mutilated and defaced condition, I am unable to say positively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>On <num value="1">one</num> only is a date visible, namely, <num value="465">465</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> &#x0022;From these dates, as well as from the <rs>Saxon</rs> ornaments, I am inclined to refer the remains to about the date of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrival of the <name>Saxons</name> in Britain.--The corpse may be that of <num value="1">one</num> of the last emissaries of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> to this island &mdash; or, as history speaks of no political intercourse between <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> and our island at that period, he may have been connected with a religious, not a civil, mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The ashes I surmise to be those of a Saxon female.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But how shall we account for the presence of the remains of a <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> and a Saxon in a common tomb?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>More strange still is the embalming of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> and the cremation of the <rs>Saxon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The position of the coffin in the bed of the river is also strange; but an overturned boat and the shifting sands may account for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Possibly the scroll found in the urn may give an explanation of this, and until this has been deciphered we must be content to remain in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>I have been instructed, in case no claim is made for the remains as &#x0027;treasure trove,&#x0027; to send the whole in their present condition to the <orgName n="British Museum" type="museum">British Museum</orgName> about the beginning of next week.&#x0022; </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It was just the kind of illustration that would convey to their minds the clearest possible idea of human madness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>To give up goods and chattels for an idea, the modern <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> has no idea of. The forefathers went to war for a principle, or sale they did, though there are a good many who think that it was a war for both principle and interest.
