<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> has within a few days gathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In force in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Warsaw Sound, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2752661">Warsaw Sound</placeName>, and to-day <num value="18">number eighteen</num> vessels, of all classes; consequently there has been some excitement in the city, and great anxiety manifested to hear the latest news from below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The letter from <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName> to the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> or <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> prepared us in a measure for the expected attack upon this post, and we have anxiously looked for the threatened movement for some days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There seems every probability that an attempt will soon be made to effect a demonstration from the neighborhood of the batteries on Skid away or <persName n="Green,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Green,nomatch:0"><surname>Green</surname></persName> islands, and this week will probably witness the attempt and its result, for it will soon be decided <num value="1">one</num> way or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName> is accessible from several points above and below its mouth at <placeName reg="Bull River, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2205916">Tybee</placeName>, and these have been carefully watched for some time, save <num value="1">one</num> hitherto neglected, and which our enemies have found to be without adequate obstructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The result of an attempt to land in force at Skid away or <placeName key="possibilities=57" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Green island</placeName>, with the intention of an advance upon the city, I believe will meet with a signal failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Our troops are eager for the fight, and will acquit themselves as become Georgians whenever they may confront the foe. I shall during this week keep myself well posted upon all that transpires on our coast and will inform you promptly, persuaded as I am that the enemy designs an attack, though it may be delayed beyond the period which I have assigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The Federal gun-boats are everywhere, save in the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName> itself, and are making great exertions to remove the various obstructions placed in the way of navigation of the small <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> On Sunday the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">St. John</rs>'s went down the river, convoyed by the <rs>Savannah</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Tatnall,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Tatnall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Tatnall</surname></persName>'s armed boats, with a guard and the staff of <persName n="Lawton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Lawton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lawton</surname></persName> on board. --She proceeded to <placeName reg="Wall's Cut">Wall's Cut</placeName>, a channel, which has long been opened and used by the steamers plying between this city and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, by the inland route; it communicates with <placeName reg="New River, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,1125392">New river</placeName>, which small stream I have once before spoken of in my letters, and thereby with the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> at the back of <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName>, affording a short cut into the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName> above <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>, and beyond the reach of its guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This cut had been blocked up by sinking an old hull athwart the channel, which at high tide is only <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> wide, with <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> of water at the best times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It had been reported that the boats of the enemy had been tampering with the hull, and to see the effect and to interrupt any further progress the steamer went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>When they neared the mouth of the cut, the officers espied <num value="2">two</num> barges full of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> making off for dear life; but unfortunately they were beyond the range of the muskets of the guard on board, who, nevertheless, did not fail to give them a parting shot or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They found that the hull had been slewed round by great labor, and it was manifest that some time must have been consumed in effecting it.--The calaboose of the vessel had been moved to the bank, and several sheds of plank had been built for their accommodation, which were burned or torn down and given to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>An anchor was brought away, but a very large <num value="1">one</num> of some <num value="15">15</num> cwt., evidently a frigate's anchor, was left, from the want of proper means of removing it from the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In such haste did the party leave, that the officers forgot to carry off their letters, which were no doubt the occupation of the moment before their precipitate flight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> I am informed that not <num value="1">one</num> hour after the steamer returned, <num value="7">seven</num> vessels of the enemy appeared at the <placeName reg="Kanawha, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1125392">New River</placeName> end of the cut, and to-day <num value="2">two</num> light-draft boats remain in the cut itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It must be remembered that this position is not more than <measure n="11miles" type="distance">11 miles</measure> from the city, and in a clear day the spars of the hireling fleet may be discerned above the low, marshy banks of the intervening space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is not easy to conjecture the object of this determined effort to gain an entrance into this river by a channel which is available only for the very lightest draft steamers, and those even of the smallest beam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They will be forced to do that to remove every vestige of the wreck still remaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It may be that they wish to introduce a number of small steamers into the space between <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Forts Pulaski</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Jackson</placeName>, with the hope of being able to shell out the occupants of the latter post, and obtain such complete possession of the river as to cut off the supplies of <placeName reg="Pulaski, Giles, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101146">Pulaski</placeName> and open the way to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I cannot but think that the design, if attempted, would equally fail, for many reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I believe that <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> could maintain its own against any such fleet as can be introduced by that avenue, and I have the necessary authority to state that the lower garrison is amply provided to withstand a siege of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, and has now at least <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> rounds of ammunition to every gun. --The only want, and a most serious <num value="1">one</num>, which may be apprehended in the event of a dry spell of weather, is the scarcity of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The fort is generally supplied by cisterns, amply capacious in ordinary seasons; but it sometimes happens, as took place during the late dry weather preceding the storm, that they fall, and no effort can be successfully made to obtain water from wells on such a barren spot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Taking everything into consideration, I think there is nothing to apprehend from the marchings and counter-marching of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and although there is some trepidation among the timid and nervous old men as well as women, a general sense of security prevails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I trust, if any stampede, such as occurred after the <rs type="place">Port Royal</rs> disaster should happen, none but women may be allowed to leave the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> In view of the late reverse which has befallen our arms in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, it behooves us, however, not to be too confident of our own strength or of the weakness of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I trust that at least this fruit will be drawn from the disaster; the general voice in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> speaks as firmly, as manfully, and as hopefully of the final result as if no loss has befallen the <rs>Republic</rs>, or no grief was felt for the gallant <rs>Zollicoffer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is with great satisfaction that the later news of the battle has been received here, lessening the importance of the affair, and reducing our loss materially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is unfortunate that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had the opportunity of communicating the news to the <rs>Southern</rs> people for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time; but had their characteristic good sense been exerted, they would have received it <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">cum grane salle,</hi></foreign> and cut it down to its legitimate proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>While we have received from the good Father above, no doubt, a merited chastisement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He has not failed to <hi rend="italics">exert</hi> His mighty power in our behalf, to teach us our dependence upon Him, the source of all our triumphs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The storm, which I perceive has raged so continuously in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and along the coasts of the <name>Carolinas</name>, extended to this vicinity, and for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> we were in the midst of so humid an atmosphere, some times becoming very like a dissuading servant, that the strong was shortly impossible to <unclear></unclear> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> and when we thought of that we were satisfied <q>&#x0022;How have the mighty fallen.&#x0022;</q> Where are the hoped-for results of the last expiring effort of the tyrant and oppressor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><q> &#x0022;In the deep ocean buried.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> I cannot apostrophize his mighty ships or his <q>&#x0022;men-of-war,&#x0022;</q> as I think it will be admitted they were very small potatoes, as the history of their dispersion will in time disclose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Where is the expedition &mdash; or at least that portion left swimming upon the surface of the great deep?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>We are mystified here completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><num value="1">One</num> day they are in <placeName reg="Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, North Carolina" key="tgn,1115016">Pamlico Sound</placeName>, and the next outside, <q>&#x0022;steering South;&#x0022;</q> and again, it is <q>&#x0022;officially contradicted,&#x0022;</q> and they are now here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The latter conjecture is highly probable, and we must accept it for want of more <q>&#x0022;reliable information.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Your article on the <rs>Lincoln</rs> blockade, in your issue of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, has brought to my recollection a subject which I had designed to write a few words about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Your suggestions in regard to the necessity of building up the manufactures of the <rs>South</rs>, now fostered in their infancy by the blockade of our harbors, and the advantages we are daily deriving from it, are very much needed at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> will compete with any State of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> in the number and variety of the manufactories she has established, and time will render them independent of any governmental assistance, should the condition of affairs not soon change.--Recently a policy has been acted upon very like that of the much-decried monopolies: the manufactories buy in a very cheap market, and they sell at very high prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Where cotton is bought at <measure n="7cents" type="currency">seven cents</measure>, the labor remaining the same, the prices have been raised <num value="300">three hundred</num> and <num value="4">four hundred per cent.</num>, establishing a system of exorbitant prices which will prove in the end ruinous to their own interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Should the war be brought to a close in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, with such a policy to start with, not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="10">ten</num> of these manufactories will survive the certain influx of foreign goods; nay, I will not exclude <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> goods in the category, unless a strict system of discriminative duties should be imposed upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Our people will buy in that market in which they can obtain the article cheapest that they may desire, and this will not be reversed in our case.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> The object of this communication is to call attention to the present condition and future prospects of that most unfortunate portion of our glorious old Commonwealth, <placeName key="tgn,7013961" n="1.000 4" reg="west virginia">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The present campaign appears to be drawing to a close, at least as it regards this division of the army; and, at this point, the inquiry naturally arises, what has been accomplished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>To this question but <num value="1">one</num> answer can be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>We believe there is but <num value="1">one</num> sentiment on this subject, which is that the campaign in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> has proved to be a complete failure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> Whether right or wrong, this is the verdict of the people, of citizens and soldiers, with regard to it. All admit that in many respects the <rs>Government</rs> has done nobly, indeed all that could have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The army has been well provisioned, and, assisted by private associations, and especially by the exertions of patriotic ladies, the soldiers have been comfortably clothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>And when we consider at what a great cost the army in the <rs>West</rs> has been sustained, and at what a great sacrifice of life, it is painful to think that this goodly land is still in the hands of the enemy, and its loyal citizens groaning under the iron heel of a miserable despot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Our beautiful valleys are laid waste, and our pleasant, quiet homes desolated; many of our best citizens have been driven from their homes, and hunted, like wild beasts in the mountains, or dragged into filthy prisons, where they are denied the necessaries of life, whilst others have been taken from their beds at the midnight hour and cruelly butchered in the presence and before the eyes of their own wives and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>But still the loyal sons of the <rs>South</rs> hold fast their integrity, and, like the primitive Christians, <q> &#x0022;Take joyfully the spoiling of their goods,&#x0022;</q> choosing rather to suffer affliction with their own people of the <rs>South</rs> than to enjoy the advantage of Lincolnism for a season; and, yet, in the face of all this, there are those who are continually prating of the disloyalty of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and all our disasters and failures have been attributed to this cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Now, it is true that there are disloyal men in the <rs>West</rs>, but it is also true that <num value="1000">thousands</num> who are called Union men are in heart as sound Southern men as are to be found in the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>But these men saw no hope of obtaining adequate assistance and protection from the <rs>South</rs>; and not willing to sacrifice everything, many of them yielded to the force of circumstances, to the necessities of the case and whilst they are for the present under the <rs>Lincoln</rs> yoke, they are earnestly wishing and ardently praying that the <rs>Southern</rs> army may come to their deliverance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> The enemy will hold <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> in spite of us, and not only so, but just so sure, <persName n="Editor,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Editor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Editor</surname></persName>, as you do not regain the <rs>Northwest</rs>, will your own fair heritage in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> be subjugated by the <rs>North</rs>.

It has never entered the mind of any man in the <rs>South</rs> to send a prison-investigating committee, to look into the pens of <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus</placeName>, the dungeons of <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Forts Lafayette</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335574" n="1.000 8" reg="fort warren, suffolk, massachusetts">Warren</placeName>, or the female jails in sight of the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>It might have been agreeable to the feelings of those amongst us connected by ties of blood or friendship with the sufferers in these places, to ascertain their wants, to remonstrate against their ill-treatment, and to carry them words of sympathy and regard. --But if we had proposed such a thing to the brutal authorities who direct the counsels of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, we all know what would have been the reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> That Government, however, is actuated by no apprehensions of rebuff from us in matters of this sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Assuming, without previous conference or inquiry, that we will let in their inspecting committee, it designates the persons to compose it, sends them to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and takes it for granted that we will receive them cordially under flags of truce, parade them through the country, and throw open our prisons for their examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The coarseness and impoliteness of the proceeding are in keeping with the arrogance in which the mission was conceived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The mission itself implies that the prisoners of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are subject to harsh and indecent treatment, and is in itself an insult offered our people and Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>We do not recollect a precedent for it in all the history of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>If it is the consolations of religion that are desired to be afforded the prisoners, the mission is an impeachment of the piety and fidelity of the whole body of Southern clergymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>If it presupposes that our policy to the prisoners is harsh or niggardly, that fact is an insult to us. If it is desired to supply extra comforts to these men in their confinement, then the object is in conflict with the rules of war, and not to be permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>In no aspect in which we can view the mission is any justification presented of the extraordinary proceeding. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> It is time that this double dealing of the <rs>North</rs> was brought to an end. When at home, they revile us without measure, and imprison every man who dares to speak a word in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>A Senator happens to write a letter of civility to <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of our Government, and forthwith a resolution is offered for his expulsion from the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The greatest barbarities are countenanced and applauded in their invading soldiery; and yet, when any object is to be subserved, they can dismiss their frowns, suspend their words of bitterness, and approach us with the gentleness and affection of brethren and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>If a few of our citizens are willing to debase themselves by loading these sycophants with attentions on coming among us, surely our Government need not forget the arrogant and hectoring attitude which their Government uniformly maintains towards us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>There is nothing in dissimulation, in hypocrisy, in fawning deportment and honeyed speech, to which they are not capable of resorting to accomplish a malicious purpose; and we are never more safe than when we repulse all their overtures of civility, as ruses to compass our ruin. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> seem of late to have parted company with the old <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> emblem &mdash; the eagle &mdash; and are continually likening themselves to the anaconda.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We scarcely take up a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper in which we do not find some exulting references to the <q>&#x0022;anaconda folds with which Yankeedom is encircling the <rs>South</rs> and preparing to crush it.&#x0022;</q> It strikes us that the selection of this new emblem of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> qualities shows some signs of returning reason in that hitherto demented population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>A crawling, greedy reptile, that bedaubs its victim with hideous slime before it swallows him, is a better representative of their character than the heaven-soaring eagle, darting lightning from his eyes and holding in his fierce talons the thunderbolts of Jove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>By all means, let the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> give up the eagle and hold on to their new friend &mdash; the <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">snake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Of all the creeping things, this is the best representative, in its vindictiveness and voracity, of the nation which has instinctively recognized it as its emblem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Instead of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> eagle, the world now sees the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> anaconda, which, having swallowed up the commerce and the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the old Union, is now eager to bolt the whole <rs>South</rs> and wind up with making a dessert of <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> and <placeName reg="Cuba" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>. </p> 
<p>
