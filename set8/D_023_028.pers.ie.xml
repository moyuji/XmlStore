<head></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> our friends would greatly oblige us by sending any Northern papers they may chance to get in their possession to this office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The public will thus receive the news at the earliest moment. </p> </argument> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>The cartel.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> We observe that some of our contemporaries are urging very grave objections to the exchange of prisoners at this moment, and we cannot but think that they will have their influence upon the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The scoundrel <rs>Pope</rs>, for instance, is doing all he can to incite his cut-throats to pillage and murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>He says he will not place any guard over any private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>At the same time, be threatens to execute any person who may kill <num value="1">one</num> of his soldiers, whether in defence of his property or not. If the actual perpetrator of the deed cannot be taken, any private citizen whom he may have in his power will be put to death in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>For this purpose he directs the seizure of all the inhabitants of the district he invades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>These orders, it will be observed were not issued until the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> became certain a general exchange was to take place, and that, by the terms of the cartel, all prisoners of war on both sides were hereafter to be paroled as soon as captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We thus leave ourselves entirely without the means of retaliating for any murder that may take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>None but soldiers are considered prisoners of war and we have no means of taking any of their private citizens; while they are in our country, and can at any time capture as many of ours as they please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The Government seems to have entirely abandoned the protection of its citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> That <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> and his inferiors will carry out his threats to the letter, unless deterred by the fear of retaliation, cannot be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Most assuredly his orders are clearly against the spirit of the <hi rend="italics">catch</hi> whatever may be the letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Our Government never could have meant to leave our citizens so entirely unprotected &mdash; so entirely at the mercy of the brigands who have been sent here to cut their threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>If the consequences are to be such, we trust that this cartel will not be observed, and it will be no violation of faith not to observe it. <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s orders and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s directions are directly opposed to its spirit, and have already rendered it of no avail to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> The contrivance of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for preventing a free people from defending their soil is <num value="1">one</num> of the most devilish of all their inventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>But it will not avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>They may murder our defenceless citizens, but they will not prevent those who survive from pursuing the invaders to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>No man is going to be deterred by any such means from fighting for his country as in the manner best suited to his situation and means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The whole proceeding is a preparation for gratuitous murder. </p> </div4> </div3>
