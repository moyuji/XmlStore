<head>The Federals in <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We have given the particulars of the successful attack of the <rs>Federal</rs> ships on <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>An setting <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> was appointed by the citizens to surrender the town, and went on board the <rs>Federal</rs> flag-ship with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>He requested <persName n="Renshaw,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Renshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Renshaw</surname></persName> to communicate to him his intentions in regard to the city, informing him at the same time of the abandonment of the city by the military, of the absence of the <rs>Mayor</rs> and <orgName n="City Council" type="council">City Council</orgName>, and of his appointment as <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> pro tem</hi> by a meeting of citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The following are the incidents of this mortifying surrender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <persName n="Renshaw,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Renshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Renshaw</surname></persName> replied that he had come for the purpose of taking possession of the city; that the city was at his mercy under his guns; that he should not interfere with the municipal affairs of the city; that the citizens might go on and conduct their business as heretofore; that he did not intend to occupy the city for the present, and until the arrival of a military commander; but that he intended to hoist the U. S. flag upon the public buildings, and that the flag should be respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Whereupon the <rs>Mayor</rs> <hi rend="italics">pre tem</hi> answered that he could not guarantee to him the protection of the flag &mdash; that he would do everything in his power &mdash; but that persons over whom he had no control might take down the flag and create a difficulty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <persName n="Renshaw,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Renshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Renshaw</surname></persName> replied that, although in his previous communications with the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName>, he had insisted that the flag should be protected by the city, still he thought it would be onerous upon the good citizens, and to avoid any difficulty like that which occurred in New Orleans, he would waive that point, and when he sent the flag ashore he would send a sufficient force to protect it, and that he would not keep the flag flying for more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> to half an hour, sufficient to show the absolute possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><persName n="Renshaw,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Renshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Renshaw</surname></persName> further said that he would insist upon the right of any of his men in charge of an officer to come on shore and walk the streets of the city, but that he would not permit his men to come on shore indiscriminately, or in the night; that, should his men insult citizens, he gave the <rs>Mayor</rs> the right to arrest and report them to him, when he would punish them more rigidly than we possibly could; but, on the other hand, should any of his men be insulted or shot at in the streets of <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>, or any of his ships or boats be shot at from the land or wharves, he would hold the city responsible, and open his broadsides on the same instantly; that his guns were kept shotted and double shotted for that purpose; that it was the determination of his Government to hold <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName> at all hazards until the end of the war, and that we could not take the port from him without a navy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> <hi rend="italics">pro tem</hi> asked his intentions in relation to the railroad bridged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The answer was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> declined; but afterwards, in conversation, he stated that he did not desire the destruction of the bridge if he was not interfered with; that he would permit the train to run up to this side of the bridge with previsions, which must be carried from there to town in vehicles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The train would not be permitted to run to town, and no communication whatever should be held by water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> <persName n="Renshaw,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Renshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Renshaw</surname></persName> stated in conclusion, that he had already advised the <rs>Admiral</rs> to send a cargo of flour, to which our party said nothing, and departed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Shortly after the return of the <rs>Mayor</rs> and party a detachment of about <num value="150">150</num> marines and sailors, including about half a dozen negroes, was sent ashore from the fleet, which landed at <persName n="Kuhn,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Kuhn,nomatch:0"><surname>Kuhn</surname></persName>'s wharf, and proceeded silently to the <rs type="place">Custom-House</rs>, on which, without any interference or demonstrations by the by standers, they raised the U. S. flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> After half an hour (at <time value="3pm">3 P. M.</time>) the flag was quietly taken down, and the detachment marched back through the same streets to their boats, and returned to the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> <hi rend="italics">pro tem,</hi> and Thomas M. League, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, subsequently (at <time value="4pm">4 P.

<head>Message of the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The Governor of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, in his message to the extraordinary session of the <name>Legislature</name> of his State, in view of the exposed condition of some portions of the <rs>State</rs>, recommends such legislation as shall enable the <rs>State</rs> authorities to control the slave labor of the <rs>State</rs> for the purpose of constructing fortifications and other means of defence on the rivers and bays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He also recommends ample appropriations from the treasury to be made, in order to cover liabilities which may be incurred thereby, and all other outlays which may be deemed needful for the better protection and security of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The Governor considers the question of supplying the people with salt <num value="1">one</num> of very great importance, and recommends the appointment of a joint commission, empowered to visit the salt land, and examine the condition of the works and the conduct of those engaged, and all points connected with the business, necessary to enable the <name>Legislature</name> to approximate the cost at which salt can be made, and to as certain the best mode for developing the supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The prise of salt, he says, should be made uniform, if possible, and that if private parties are unwilling to accept reasonable profits upon their capital and labor thus employed, he would recommend, as the true policy, that the <rs>State</rs> take possession of all the works, with authority to press laborers and everything needed, and operate them under a regulated system for the common benefit of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In speaking of allowing the citizens of other States to manufacture salt for their own use at any of the works, except those on the <rs>State</rs> reservations, the <rs>Governor</rs> says:<cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;United as are these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, in a common destiny, and mutually dependent, as they are, upon each other, I trust that the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></orgName> will concur in the expediency and propriety of inviting the citizens of other States to the salt supply which they may obtain within our limits by devoting their own labor and capital to its development.&#x0022;</q><bibl n="The Governor"></bibl></cit> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> In behalf of the indigent families of absent soldiers a liberal appropriation is recommended, which should be disbursed without any invidious distinction among the needy families of absent soldiers, whether volunteers or conscripts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> On the subject of distilleries and the retailing of spirits, the <rs>Governor</rs> says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> &#x0022;I recommend that authority be given for distillation of alcohol or spirits, which may be needful for medical uses within the <rs>State</rs>, and also, for whatever reasonable amount may be found to be the just proportion of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, for a like purpose in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>By confining the distilleries to localities where grain is abundant; fixing a reasonable price for the spirits; restraining by adequate penalties the parties engaged in the business, and those who may purchase from them for medical supplies, it is believed this object may be obtained without serious diminution of the supply of grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>And I recommend that the retailing of spirituous liquors in any city, town, or neighborhood, where State or Confederate troops may be stationed or rendezvoused, be prohibited during their sojourn, and that stringent regulations be adopted to accomplish this result.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Governor"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> On the subjects of the <name>Conscript</name> law and the <rs>State</rs> militia, he says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> &#x0022;But whatever doubts may have arisen as to the powers of Congress, all agree that the public exigency demanded the adoption of the most stringent measures to preserve the efficiency and increase the strength of the army.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Governor"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> A reorganization of the <rs>State</rs> militia is considered indispensable, and a change in the military code is recommended, by which it will be made to embrace as militia all able-bodied male citizens of the <rs>State</rs>, above the age of <num value="16">sixteen</num> and under the age of <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure>, who may not be actually engaged in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service. </p> </div3>
