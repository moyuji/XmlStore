<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> We are warranted also to take encouragement from prophecies already fulfilled as well as from the prediction laid down in the <hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></hi> particular, and to put our trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that in his own time he would bring good out of evil, and that the end would be joy and gladness. &#x0022;Therefore the redeemed of the <rs>Lord</rs> shall return and come with singing unto <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Zion</placeName>; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head; they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee a way.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> His fury is nothing to fear, &#x0022;And has feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were <hi rend="italics">ready</hi> to destroy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Well might we ask &#x0022;where is the <hi rend="italics">furry</hi> of the oppressor as if he were <hi rend="italics">ready</hi> to destroy&#x0022; And now <num value="1">one</num> of their foremost orators who made himself conspicuous on the floors of Congress for his bitterness against us had lately been stain by Southern bullets.--he who said that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> should yet furnish a Governor for <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Peace to his ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We wish to his spirit no harm but we could ask &#x0022;Is he <hi rend="italics">ready</hi> to destroy; where is the tury of the oppressor?&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors of Dispatch:</hi>--We have seen in print the great success of the government hospitals at <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> These ladies (and we use the word &#x0022;ladies&#x0022; expressly) give not only their time and labor gratis to the sufferers; but they give their own private purses daily to the same cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The patients there after a nice meal of some delicacy, quite foreigner to a governmental commissariat, have often breathed their satisfaction at having a government so parental as to provide them with such; but have been both surprised and pained, when convalescent enough to get about and peer behind the curtain, to find that all those delicate extras came not from the commissary, but from the pockets of those noble women who had surely done enough in attending their bedsides without thus depleting their own purses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Had they, in doing thus, have but <hi rend="italics">shared</hi> with the sick soldier, they would have merited the gratitude of himself and the country; but when in doing so they have dieted themselves upon the coarse fare of the commissariat, they deserve all that a country and a people (and history too) can award them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> --We fully agree with a Southern contemporary that it is unjust and impolitic to depreciate the courage of the enemy, representing them as a race of cowards, ready to disperse upon the reading of the riot act. By such a representation we induce our own brave soldiers to relax their vigilance, and when victorious, as they almost always are, the laurels won from a pusillanimous foe can neither be very brilliant nor enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The great mass of all races of men are endowed with physical courage, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> form no exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It is equally true that they have achieved no military reverses in the present war, for they are fighting in a bad cause, and against a people who have not only more military spirit and aptitude, but who are defending their homes and all that makes life worth having.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Nor, were the enemy uniformly triumphant, instead of uniformly defeated, would the result have any considerable bearing on the question whether the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are or are not a brave people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>For it is not the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who compose the main body of the rank and file of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, but the <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> and <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, who have always made splendid soldiers, and whose courage and endurance are proverbial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Even if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are as great <sic>poltroons</sic> as many suppose, they have got men to fight for them who have always been regarded as among the best fighting materials in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and hence we ought not to despise the enemy, nor dim the laurels of our own heroic defenders by representing their victories as easily achieved. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> Since your adjournment the people of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> have conducted the war in the face of almost unparalleled difficulties, with a spirit and success alike worthy of themselves and of the great cause in which they are struggling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Since that time <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, too, has become the theatre of active hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The Federal forces have not only refused to acknowledge her right to be neutral, and have insisted upon making her a party to the war, but have invaded her for the purpose of attacking the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Outrages of the most despotic character have been perpetrated upon her people; some of her most eminent citizens have been seized and borne away to languish in foreign prisons without knowing who were their accusers, or the specific charges made against them, while others have been forced to abandon their homes, families, and property, and seek a refuge in distant lands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> Finding that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were about to be invaded through <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and that her people, after being deceived into a mistaken security, were unarmed, and in danger of being subjugated by the <rs>Federal</rs> forces, our armies were marched into that State to repel the enemy and prevent their occupation of certain strategic points which would have given them great advantages in the contest &mdash; a step which was justified, not only by the necessities of self-defence on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, but, also, by a desire to aid the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It was never intended by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to conquer or coerce the people of that State; but, on the contrary, it was declared by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> that they would withdraw their troops if the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would do likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Proclamation was also made of the desire to respect the neutrality of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and the intention to abide by the wishes of her people as soon as they were free to express their opinions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> These declarations were approved by me, and I should regard it as <num value="1">one</num> of the best effects of the march of our troops into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> if it should end in giving to her people liberty of choice and a free opportunity to decide their own destiny according to their own will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/> The army has been chiefly instrumental in prosecuting the great contest in which we are engaged; but the navy has also been effective in full proportion to its means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>The naval officers deprived to a great extent of an opportunity to make their professional skill available at sea have served with commendable seal and gallantry on shore and upon inland waters, further detail of which will be found in the reports of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretaries of the Navy</rs> and War. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> In the transportation of the mails many difficulties have arisen which will be found fully developed in the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The absorption of the ordinary means of transportation for the movement of troops and military supplies, the insufficiency of the rolling stock of railroads for the accumulation of business resulting both from military operations and the obstruction of water communication by the presence of the enemy's flee; the failure and even refusal of contractors to comply with the terms of their agreements, the difficulties inherent in inaugurating so vast and complicated a system as that which requires postal facilities for every town and village in a territory so extended as ours, have all combined to impede the best directed efforts of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs>, whose zeal, industry, and ability have been taxed to the utmost extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Some of these difficulties can only be overcome by time and an improved condition of the country upon the restoration of peace, but others may be remedied by legislation, and your attention is invited in the recommendations contained in the report of the <rs type="place">Head</rs> of that Department. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/> The condition of the <name>Treasury</name> will, doubtless, be a subject of anxious inquiry on your part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>I am happy to say that the financial system already adopted has worked well so far, and promises good results for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>To the extent that Treasury notes may be issued, the <rs>Government</rs> is enabled to borrow money without interest, and thus facilitate the conduct of the war. This extent is measured by the portion of the field of circulation which these notes can be made to occupy.--The proportion of the field thus occupied depends again upon the amount of the debts for which they are receivable; and when dues, not only to the <rs>Confederate</rs> and State Governments, but also to corporations and individuals, are payable in this medium, a large amount of it may be circulated at part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>There is every reason to believe that the <rs>Confederate Treasury</rs> note is fast becoming such a medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The provision that these notes shall be convertible into Confederate stock, bearing <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> interest, at the pleasure of the holder, ensures them, against a depreciation below the value of that stock, and no considerable fall in that value need be feared so long as the interest shall be punctually paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The punctual payment of this interest has been secured by the act passed by you at the last session, imposing such a rate of taxation as must provide sufficient means for that purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/> For the successful prosecution of this war, it is indispensable that the means of transporting troops and military supplies be furnished, as far as possible, in such manner as not to interrupt the commercial intercourse between our people, nor place a check on their productive energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>To this end the means of transportation from <num value="1">one</num> section of our country to the other must be carefully guarded and improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>And this should be the object of anxious care on the part of State and Confederate Governments, so far as they may have power over the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/> We have already <num value="2">two</num> main systems, of through transportation from the <rs>North</rs> to the <rs>South</rs>--<num value="1">one</num> from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, along the sea board; the other through <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> to New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> might be occurred by completing a link of about <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> between <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville, in Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Greensboro, Guilford, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014135">Greensborough, in North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The construction <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> of this comparatively short line would give them through route from North to South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>In the interior of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and give us access to a population and to military resource from which we are now, in a great measure, debarred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>We should increase greatly the safety and capacity of our means for transporting men and military supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>If the construction of this road should, in the judgment of Congress, as it is in mine, be indispensable for the most successful prosecution of the war, the action of the <rs>Government</rs> will not be restrained by the constitutional objection which would attach to a work for commercial purposes, and attention is invited to the practicability of securing its early completion by giving the needful aid to the company organized for its construction and administration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/> If we husband our means and make a judicious use of our resources it would be difficult to fix a limit to the period during which we could conduct a war against the adversary whom we now encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>The every efforts which he makes to isolate and invade us must exhaust his means whilst they serve to complete the circle and diversity the productions of our industrial system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>The reconstruction which he seeks to effect by arms becomes daily more and more palpably impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Not only do the causes which induced us to separate still exist in full force, but they have been strengthened, and whatever doubt may have lingered in the minds of any must have been completely dispelled by subsequent events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>If, instead of being a dissolution of a league, it were indeed a rebellion in which we are engaged, we might find ample vindication for the course we have adopted in the scenes which are now being enacted in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Our people now look with contemptuous astonishment on those with whom they had been so recently associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>They shrink with aversion from the bare idea of renewing such a connexion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>When they see a President making war without the assent of Congress; when they behold judges threatened because they maintain the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> so sacred to freemen; when they see justice and law trampled under the armed heel of military authority, and upright men and innocent women dragged to distant dungeons upon the mere edict of a despot; when they find all this tolerated and applauded by a people who had been in the full enjoyment of freedom but a few months ago &mdash; they believe that there must be some radical incompatibility between such a people and themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>With such a people we may be content to live at peace, but the separation is final, and for the independence we have asserted we will accept no alternative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/> The nature of the hostilities which they have waged against us, must be characterized as barbarous wherever it is understood.--They have bombarded undefended villages without giving notice to women and children to enable them to escape, and in <num value="1">one</num> instance, selected the night as the period when they might surprise them most effectually, whilst asleep and unsuspicious of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Arson and rapine, the destruction or private houses and property, and injuries of the most wanton character, even upon non combatants, have marked their forays along our borders and upon our territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Although we ought to have been admonished by these things, that they were disposed to make war upon us in the most cruel and relentless spirit; yet, we were not prepared to see them fit out a large naval expedition, with the confessed purpose not only to pillage, but to incite a servile insurrection in our midst. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> If they convert their soldiers into incendiaries and robbers, and involve us in a species of war which claims non-combatants, women and children as its victims, they must expect to be treated as outlaws and enemies of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>There are certain rights of humanity which are entitled to respect, even in war, and he who refuses to regard them, forfeits his claims, if captured, to be considered as a prisoner of war, but must expect to be dealt with as an offender against all law, human and divine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/> But not content with violating our rights, under the law of nations, at home, they have extended these injuries to us within other jurisdictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The distinguished gentlemen whom, with your approval, at the last session, I commissioned to represent the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at certain foreign courts, have been recently seized by the captain of a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ship-of-war, on board a British steamer, on their voyage from the neutral Spanish port of <placeName reg="Montour Falls, Schuyler, New York" key="tgn,2070618">Havana</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have thus claimed a general jurisdiction over the high seas, and entering a British ship, sailing under its country's flag, violated the rights of embassy, for the most part held sacred even amongst barbarians, by seizing our Ministers whilst under the protection, and within the dominions, of a neutral nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>These gentlemen were as much under the jurisdiction of the <rs>British Government</rs>, upon that ship, and beneath its flag, as if they had been on its soil; and a claim, on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to seize them in the streets of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, would have been as well founded as that to apprehend them where they were taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Had they been malefactors, and citizens even of the <rs>U. States</rs>, they could not have been arrested on a British ship, or on <name>British</name> soil, unless under the express provisions of a treaty, and according to the forms therein provided for the extradition of criminals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> But rights the most sacred seem to have lost all respect in their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>When <persName n="Faulkner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Faulkner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Faulkner</surname></persName>, a former Minister of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, commissioned before the secession of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, his native State, returned in good faith to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to settle his accounts and fulfill all the obligations into which he had entered, he was perfidiously arrested and imprisoned in New York, where he now is. The unsuspecting confidence with which he reported to his Government was abused, and his desire to fulfill his trust to them was used to his injury. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/> In conducting this war, we have sought no aid and proposed no alliances offensive and defensive abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>We have asked for a recognized place in the great family of nations, but in doing so we have demanded nothing for which we did not offer a fair equivalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The advantages of intercourse are mutual amongst nations, and in seeking to establish diplomatic relations, we were only endeavoring to place that intercourse under the regulation of public law. Perhaps we had the right, if we had chosen to exercise it, to ask to know whether the principle that &#x0022;blockades, to be binding, must be effectual,&#x0022; so solemnly announced by the great powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, is to be generally enforced or applied only to particular parties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/> When the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> at your last session became a party to the declaration reaffirming this principle of international law, which has been recognized so long by publicists and Governments, we certainly supposed that it was to be universally enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The customary law of nations is made up of their practice rather than their declarations; and if such declarations are only to be enforced in particular instances at the pleasure of those who make them, then the commerce of the world so far from being placed under the regulation of a general law, will become subject to the caprice of those who execute or suspend it at will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>If such is to be the course of nations in regard to this law, it is plain that it will thus become a rule for the weak and not for the strong. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> Feeling that such views must be taken by the neutral nations of the earth, I have caused the evidence to be collected which proves completely the utter inefficiency of the proclaimed blockade of our coast and shall direct it to be laid before such Government a as shall afford us the means of being heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>But although we should be benefited by the enforcement of this law so solemnly declared by the great powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, we are not dependent on that enforcement for the successful prosecution of the war. As long as hostilities continue the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will exhibit a steadily increasing capacity to furnish their troops with food, clothing and arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>If they should be forced to forego many of the luxuries and some of the comforts of life, they will, at least, have the consolation of knowing that they are thus daily becoming more and more independent of the rest of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>If, in this process, labor in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> should be gradually diverted from, those great Southern staples which have given life to so much of the commerce of mankind into other channels, so as to make them rival producers instead of profitable customers, they will not be the only or even the chief losers by this change in the direction of their industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Although it is true that the cotton supply from the <rs>Southern States</rs> could only be totally cut off by the subversion of our social system, yet it is plain that a long continuance of this blockade might, by a diversion of labor and an investment of capital in other employments, so diminish the supply as to bring ruin upon all those interests of foreign countries which are dependent on that staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>For every laborer who is diverted from the culture of cotton in the <rs>South</rs>, perhaps, <num value="4">four</num> times as many elsewhere, who have found subsistence in the various employments growing out of its use, will be forced, also, to change their occupation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/> While the war which is waged to take from us the right of self-government can never attain that end, it remains to be seen how far it may work a revolution in the industrial system of the world, which may carry suffering to other lands as well as to our own. In the meantime, we shall continue this struggle in humble dependence upon <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> from whose searching scrutiny we cannot conceal the secrets of our hearts, and to whose rule we confidently submit our destinies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>For the rest, we shall depend upon ourselves &mdash; Liberty is always won where there exists the unconquerable will to be free, and we have reason to know the strength that is given by a conscious sense, not only of the magnitude, but of the righteousness of our cause. </p>
