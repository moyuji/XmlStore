<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The city was as quiet and as placid yesterday as though we were still in the full enjoyment of &#x0022;piping times of peace,&#x0022; and no hostile armies were confronting each other on the south side of the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Not a solitary rumor did we hear throughout the day, and the <rs n="Maryland Campaign" type="campaign">Maryland campaign</rs> having come to an end, our citizens had no better theme for discussion than the probability of the death of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This report was revived by the statement of a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName> that the flags on the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> shipping in <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName> were at half mast, and the same assertion was made by a soldier who arrived yesterday from <placeName reg="Howlett">Howlett</placeName>'s.--This, however, may have been in consequence of the death of some officer of less note than <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It was currently reported last evening that a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deserter, who was brought to the city, affirmed that the <rs>Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> had certainly departed this life; but some proof beyond the assertion of a straggling <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is necessary to convince us of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Of <num value="1">one</num> thing, however there is no doubt &mdash; <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is keeping very quiet, if he is not dead, and has apparently entirely changed his reckless policy of hard and stubborn fighting, and exposing his men to the dangers of Confederate bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is reported, however, that <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> has started out upon another raiding expedition, and it is quite possible that the <rs>Federal</rs> commander expects, as a result of this movement, to accomplish his purposes by starving the capital of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> into submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>According to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts he has gone towards the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>, with a view of intercepting the &#x0022;invaders of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>&#x0022; on their way home, and we may have stirring news from that quarter before many days elapse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We venture the prediction that he will find this &#x0022;war path.&#x0022; no easier to travel than was the <num value="1">one</num> last chosen, when he was so unceremoniously turned back at Trevillan's by <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,,Fitz,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and sent flying in dismay towards the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> We learned from passengers by the <rs>Petersburg</rs> train last evening that everything was quiet up to <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, and that there was less shelling than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We were informed that only <num value="1">one</num> missile had been thrown at the city during the morning, and that struck in the locality known as <placeName reg="Pocahontas, Randolph, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009278">Pocahontas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were possessed of the ordinary trials of civilization, they would abandon this practice altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It does not involve the surrender either of the city or its fortifications, and its only effect is to injure private property and to drive women and children from their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The artillery firing and skirmishing on the lines yesterday did not amount to much, and our army in the trenches had full opportunity to enjoy the refreshing rain, which was highly acceptable after the protracted drought. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At his own request, however, he was allowed to return to duty in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, being desirous of casting his destinies with that portion of the country to which he was most devotedly attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>On the <date value="1861-04-16">16th of April, 1861,</date> he resigned his commission and tendered his services to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> You have been aware for several months past of my desire to withdraw from my present official position, and of the reasons which restrained me from so doing.--With an earnest purpose to devote to the service of my country, during the perils which surround her, whatever facilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>I may possess, I had nevertheless perceived that the enormous burdens imposed on the <name>Treasury</name> by a war on so vast a scale, and the difficulty of sustaining them, had given rise to discontent and to distrust in the ability of the officer administering the financial department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>To these elements of dissatisfaction was added another arising from essential differences in the plans submitted by the head of the department and those adopted by Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> In this condition of things, it would seem to have been proper to have resigned my office as soon as Congress had passed its judgment against the plans which I had submitted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> <num value="2">Two</num> considerations, however, prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was a repugnance to any act which could be misconstrued into an abandonment of a post of duty assigned to me during a struggle in which I felt that every citizen owed to his country whatever sacrifice or service was demanded of him. The financial plan which was finally adopted by the last Congress had been uncertain until the end of the session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It was not matured until the <num value="2">two</num> houses had referred the matter to committees of conference, and it became a law only on the last day of the session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The machinery which was required for its operation was complex and extensive, and, by the terms of the law, just <measure n="40days" type="date">forty days</measure> were allowed to carry it into complete effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>No new head of the department, however competent, would have been able to acquire sufficient knowledge of office details in time to have carried out the provisions of the act. The public good, therefore, demanded that I should not leave my post during this period. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> consideration which prevented was the unwillingness I felt to leave you in opposition to your desire, while you honored me with such confidence as you have manifested, and while your whole energies were still taxed by the great and varied responsibilities attendant upon the office in which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has placed you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> These considerations now no longer govern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is at an end. The funding of the currency has been nearly completed, and the entire machinery required by the plans of Congress for taxes and finance is now in full operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>No public interest will suffer by my now giving place to a successor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> consideration must yield to the conviction that justice to myself and the public require me to insist on your acceptance of the resignation which I now tender, in the hope that you will be successful in choosing a successor whose views shall harmonize with those of Congress, and who may, on that account, be better <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> able (none can be more earnestly desirous) than I have been to do valuable service to our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> I confess, sir, that I cannot, without deep emotion, separate from you and my colleagues in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Neither can I do so without bearing my testimony, that never, in the utmost freedom of confidential intercourse, have I heard <num value="1">one</num> word or suggestion indicating aught but a conscientious and disinterested desire to do what was best for our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It had been my hope, that ere our official connection terminated, our country would be in full fruition of the peace and independence for which she has paid so costly a price, and that you, sir, would have enjoyed in the spectacle of her happiness and prosperity, the only reward you seek for the ceaseless cares and labors devoted to her service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Though this may not now be. I shall not cease in private life to give my warm co-operation in whatever may conduce to the consummation so ardently desired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> I need scarcely add, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, that while desiring to be relieved at as early a period as may be practicable, my services remain freely at your disposal until you shall have selected my successor in office. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Some months since you expressed a desire to retire, for the reason that, in your belief, the public service would be promoted by the appointment of a successor whose views of financial policy accorded better than your own with the legislation then lately adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I knew the extreme difficulty of conducting the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName> during the pending struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I was aware that any officer, however competent, must probably fail to escape the animadversions of those who are ready to attribute to inefficient administration the embarrassments due to deficiency of resources and the want of legislation best adapted to the existing circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The experience acquired by you in the organization and management of the <name>Department</name> could not be immediately replaced, and for these reasons I was satisfied that the general welfare would be injuriously affected by your withdrawal at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>You have now at least the consolation and satisfaction to know that your personal wishes were surrendered to a conviction of public duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Recent events do not warrant me in refusing your renewed request that I should accept your resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The regret your express at the prospect of our official separation is sincerely shared by me. From your entrance on the duties of your office I have observed and appreciated the cheerful and unremitting devotion of all your faculties to the pubic service, and do not fail to remember that it was at the sacrifice of private inclinations that you continued to fulfill the arduous duties of your post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The offer you make of your services until your successor can assume office, is in the same patriotic spirit, and is accepted as thankfully as it is generously tendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>At as early a period as practicable I will endeavor to comply with your request to be relieved. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>He was distinguished for the pertinacity of his defence of the interests of the <rs>Government</rs>, as he understood them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Indeed, he carried his zeal to the extreme of regarding only <num value="1">one</num> side of questions between the <rs>Government</rs> and others, and that side was the <rs>Government</rs>'s. He stood forth more as the counsel or advocate than the minister of Government, and made no concessions to the rights of other parties.--Hundreds of cases, arising out of call loans, and funding money, and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>etc., illustrated his inveterate habit.--This peculiarity of the <rs>Secretary</rs>, together with a forbidding, and often rude, manner to persons in official intercourse, were quite enough to make him very unpopular, independent of his misfortune of being the financial agent of a Government obliged to issue a large amount of paper money to be inevitably depreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Every Minister of Finance of a Government incurring a large debt by printing promissory notes to carry on a war, becomes unpopular, and is made the scapegoat of public embarrassments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>So the late <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> would probably have been unpopular enough even without his contracted view of his relation to the <rs>Government</rs> and people, and his harsh and hard demeanor and judgment, and his granitive presence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>As for the routine of the office, a man of his quick perceptions can master it in a day, and that, we take it, is all that the most inveterate politician could do. He comes in wedded to no special theory and pledged to no particular party; for that, we suppose, is what is meant by his being no party man. A <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> ought</hi> to belong to no party; for if he do, he will inevitably embrace the policy of that party, be it right or wrong, ruinous or beneficial, and press it to the overthrow of the public prosperity, if it lead to that issue.

He belongs to that class of highly educated men whose extensive knowledge and enlightened views have been directed to the study of trade, in its widest and most liberal acceptation &mdash; to that class from whom the statesmen of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> derive all the knowledge of finance they ever possess, through the channel of examinations before the committees of Parliament &mdash; to that class to which the world is more deeply indebted for its knowledge of financial affairs than to all the politicians that ever existed &mdash; to that class in whose ranks were found Ricardo and Overstone, and which alone, of all others, it is possible to suppose possessed of the practical knowledge necessary to constitute the basis of financial operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>If this be all that can be said against <persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="nearbymention:Trenholm,George,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>, his qualifications must be rare indeed.
