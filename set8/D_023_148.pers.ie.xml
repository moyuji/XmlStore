<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> And whereas the hostilities waged against this Confederacy by the forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under the command of said <persName n="Butier,,Benjamin,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="default:Butier,Benjamin,F.,,"><foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Butier</surname></persName>, have borne he resemblance to such warfare as is alone permissible by the rules of international law or the usages of civilization, but have been characterised by repeated atrocities and outrages, among the large number of which, the following may be cited as examples: </p> 
<p>

<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>An interesting account &mdash; a failure Acknowledged.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> A correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, under date of <q>&#x0022; <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, <date value="12-14">December 14th</date> <num value="11">11</num> P. M,&#x0022;</q> thus writes: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> It is no pleasant task to cool ardent hopes-- disappoint high expectations &mdash; predict the unfulfilling of fond wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Yet stern realities can never be recognized too soon in order to enable us to prepare for their possible consequences; and hence I trust I will not be blamed for the revelation of the discouraging facts pertaining to the condition in which the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> is on this morning, after yesterday's sanguinary, all but fruitless, struggle </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> Undertakings of any kind are measured by the power employed to carry them out and the result realized by it. This rule applied to yesterday's bloody work of our arms, <num value="1">one</num> cannot help coming to the conclusion that they came short of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The main object of their efforts was the dislodgement of the rebels from their entrenched position on the heights, the possession of which gave them control of all the roads leading southward from the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>But although every means of which the character of the task admitted was used neither the whole nor any portion of the line occupied by the enemy at the opening of the battle is to day in our hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> The causes of our failure are so plain that they cannot be mistaken by even the most unprofessional of observers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We had for the attack superiority of numbers and armament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The former war not only more than balanced by the strength of the enemy's position, but also as available to its full extent of momentum, owing to the unfavorable ground from which we moved to the attack.--An individual, however strong in muscle, cannot successfully contend with an adversary if confined with an adversary if confined to space so narrow as to prevent the free use of his arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Our right, although sufficiently powerful in point of numbers for the work assigned to it, was precluded from a full and simultaneous display of us strength by being crammed into the streets of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I doubt whether the history of wars affords another instance of an army attempting to combat from within a town with another enjoying the full freedom of motion given by abundance of space. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> The <num value="6">six</num> divisions of the <orgName n="Right Grand Division" type="division">Right Grand Division</orgName> were crowded into these streets so thickly that during <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> there troops had hardly sleeping room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The corps of the <rs>Centre Grand Division</rs>, acting as their reserve, was separated from them soon after the battle <unclear> </unclear> by the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> &mdash; another remarkable-- emittance bearing destructively upon the operations of the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> As to our preponderance in artillery, the impracticability of making it tell upon the fortunes of the day deprived as almost wholly of the benefit of it on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>During the entire struggle on that portion of the lines all but <num value="2">two</num> of the batteries attached to the <rs>Right Crand Division</rs> and Butler-field's corps stood unemployed on the lower streets of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Our batteries on the heights on the right bank of the river could also render no protection to our infantry, as their fire would have done as much damage to our own troops as to the enemy after the former had moved to the attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> Our left did not suffer like the right from the drawback of want of space, as it man&#x0153;uvred on a high place and bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Yet, both wings labored under the disadvantage of righting from low against the enemy on high ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> The obstructions of the sense of the action on our right, in the form of walls, fences and houses, unavoidably confined the movement of our troops, as they successively advanced to the front, to the streets, which were so constantly and completely blocked up during the afternoon that it was impossible for the ammunition trains to reach the divisions of French and <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, after they were relieved by others, and supply them with cartridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>They were there by virtually placed <hi rend="italics">hors de combat</hi> greatly weakening the force of our attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> Whatever the results of the battle may be termed &mdash; check or repulse-- it is certain that the failure to accomplish what we attempted is not the only evil fruit of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I have spent several hours this morning in visiting the field and the positions held by our troops, and I found the most unmistakable evidence everywhere that the expenditure of strength has been so great as to produce exhaustion to a degree that will render the resumption of the offensive on our part impossible, not only for to day, but for several days to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The extent of our loss in killed and wounded is not ascertained as yet with anything like definiteness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>I have seen enough, however, to satisfy me that will be even greater than it was supposed last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>If <num value="6000">6,000</num> will cover that of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Right Grand Division" type="division">Right Grand Division</orgName></hi> I shall be gratefully disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The fact that many of our men have been taken prisoners has only become known this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But it is not in the casualties alone that the army has been weakened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The fatigue and exposure of the soldiers for the last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> has been very great, as they have been standing under arms in the mud and cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Upon the whole, it is my deliberate opinion &mdash; and I know it is shared by many of the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs> I have seen &mdash; that the army is not fit for the immediate renewal of hostilities, and that it requires rest imperatively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It is likewise evident that the unsuccessful fighting of yesterday, and the hardships endured, have not only affected the bodies, but also the spirits of both officers and men, and time for mental recuperation seems also to be required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> No <num value="1">one</num> would be gladder to reflect the bright <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> sides of the situation and prospect of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> than myself; yet a sense of truth compels me to state that it is not by any means encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>To renew an attack on the enemy's position during the night, strengthened, as it has been ascertained this morning, by new batteries, with weakened numbers, would probably result in no better success than that of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>To continue in the position now held cannot be thought of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>An attempt to retreat to this side of the river by the precarious means of passage, over a few frail bridges, would undoubtedly bring the victorious hosts of the enemy at once to the attack, and might result in the worst calamity of the war. How the army is to be extricated from these predicaments, I am unable to devise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I trust that those entrusted with its fortunes have the ability to do it. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> Shall we say, then it was a defeat?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Certainly. If to have started out to accomplish a certain object, and to have failed in doing so, be a defeat, you can apply no other term to the upshot of to day's battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> In spite of all the glosses of official dispatches which you may receive, it seems here to night that we have suffered a defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Let us hope that, when fully prepared, the assault may be renewed with new tactical combination, the position carried, and the day retrieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>If it be not so, the <date value="12-13">13th day of December</date> must be accounted a black day in the calendar of the <rs>Republic</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> If you are disposed to indulge in criticism on the plan of the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs> it will not be difficult to point out its great and radical defects.--To have hurled forward masses of men against the fortified works of those terraces was certainly a manifestation of daring, untempered by the slights prudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Was it not also a fatal error to have risked the whole success of the plan on the accomplishment of a certain man&#x0153;uvre, (<placeName reg="Franklin, Franklin, Virginia" key="tgn,2111847">Franklin</placeName>'s ability to swing round on the rebel flanks, namely,) where all the elements of the problem were completely wanting!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>What a fearful fatality, too, that our accumulation of artillery was all but entirely unless to us, owing to the distance of the range and the exposure of our own troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>And what a misfortune, equally lamentable, that the approach to the rebel positions back of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> was as area so restricted that our field batteries were almost equally useless, owing to the impossibility of man&#x0153;uvering </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> In the course of this correspondence, from the time of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occupation of <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName>; I have informed you of the gradual development of the rebel position, from an absolutely defenceless condition to the time that it became another <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Never for a moment did we, who watched this progress, suppose that it would ever be attempted to be taken by hurling masses of men against those works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We had supposed that the resources of strategy would assuredly afford other means of accomplishing the desired end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> Regarded as a position of defence, that which the rebel leaders have taken up on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and which we have been pleased to assail in the manner indicated and with the result known, none could possibly be more magnificent or more nearly impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>With <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men they should easily hold it with <num value="3">three</num> times that number of assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>And, indeed, they appear never to have employed more than about than about that number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>I take it that they had along the line of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> about <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> men, and that <num value="50000">50,000</num>, more or less, were actually engaged in the contest. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Those of our troops on the outposts were unaware of the movement until just before day light, when an officer went to each individual man and, in a low tone, ordered him to full back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> The remark attributed to a Federal prisoner that the war found its chief support at the <rs>North</rs> among speculators, who were making money by large contracts and otherwise, has much foundation in truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Fanaticism, sectional hate, the desire to vindicate its courage, and above all, the determination to hold on to Southern trade, exert great influence in keeping alive the war spirit, but it is the speculators who form the watching and working element of all these powerful combinations, who derive the most, and, in fact, the only direct advantage of any party from the war, and who, therefore, never relax their vigilance, nor permit others to relax it, and who leave no stone unturned to keep in active operation an enterprise which every day puts money in their purse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> It is a popular fancy that mankind are universally endowed with a conscience, but we should like to see the magnifying glass that would bring to light the existence of the bump of conscientiousness on the head of men who trade in human blood What more could device do than they do, and yet, such is the self-complacency and self delusion of human nature, they are not only satisfied with themselves, but delighted with the opportunity of growing rich in that way. The wretched criminal who, for the sake of money, murders a single victim, is consigned to the gallows; but the sleek and well-fed speculators, who, from the same motive are accessory to the murder of tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, never reproach themselves for their conduct, plume themselves upon their blood stained treasures, and are respectfully recognized by society as the <q>&#x0022;solid men&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;upper <num value="10">ten</num>&#x0022;</q> of the land. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>When they hear of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> defeat they are almost as much pleased as the <rs>Confederates</rs>, because there must be a new army to equip and supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They are not without hopes of transmitting to their posterity, as a rich inheritance, their interest in putting down the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The untold agonies of the war only add to their wealth and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Every death groan represents to them a certain number of greenbacks, and the more death groans the higher and broader swells that attractive pile. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> In our own country we have speculators also, and although they have no influence in carrying on the war, they are as callous and cruel, to the extent of their opportunities, as their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The monstrous act, of extortion now practiced in the <rs>South</rs> could never be committed by men with human hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The sufferings, and perhaps deaths, which will occur this dreary winter among the poor, will be directly chargeable to the speculators and extortioners, who, for their own base gains are crushing the community to powder.
