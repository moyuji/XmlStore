<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The following is an extract: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Soldiers!</hi> Your brutal and malignant enemy is putting forth efforts unexampled in the history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Having failed to subjugate you, he is maddened with the thirst for vengeance, and is pushing forward his foreign mercenaries to plunder your property and lay waste your homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But his marauding hosts have been so often beaten and baffled that they are now discourage and demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Should you be able to check them everywhere for the next <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, the <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> whose time expires in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> will not re-enlist, and the war will end before <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Should the scoundrels, however, gain a single substantial success at any <num value="1">one</num> point, the war will be prolonged during the entire Administration of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It becomes a solemn duty, then, to labor and fight during the next <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> as we have never done before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We must make the war unpopular with the mercenary vandals of the <rs>North</rs> by harassing and annoying them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We must cut down to <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> by <num value="2">two</num>, the dimensions of the farms which these plunderers propose to appropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>You will have to endure more hardships, and to fight more desperate battles than you would have done were your ranks property filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Our cities, towns, and villages are full of young and able-bodied skulkers, wearing the semblance of men, who have dodged from the battle-field under the provisions of the exemption bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The scorn of the fair sex, and the contempt of all honorable men, have not been able to drive these cowardly miscreants into the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>So long as they can fatten upon the miseries of the country, and shelter their worthless carcasses from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cutlets, they are in sensible be shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But a day of retribution awaits these abortions of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Their own descendants will execrate their memory, when the finger of scorn is pointed and the taunt is uttered, &#x0022;he is the son, or grandson, or great grandson of an exempt and extortioner.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Do your full duty, soldiers, and leave these poltroons and villains to the execration of posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>All <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officers</rs> are hereby enjoined to furnish the names of officers and men who distinguish themselves in pitched battles and skirmishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>There so distinguishing themselves will be recommended for promotion, and their names published in the principal papers of their respective States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The infantry have to bear the brunt of every battle, and to endure special hardships in every campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The post of danger and of suffering is the post of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>If our liberty be ever won. It will be due mainly to the indomitable pluck and sturdy endurance of our heroic infantry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The <orgName n="Confederate Artillery" type="artillery">Confederate artillery</orgName> has behaved most nobly, and the wonder is that, with inferior guns and ammunition, it has been able to cope successfully with the splendid armament of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It has been a mistake, however, to contend with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <orgName n="Artillery Reserve" type="military">artillery. Reserve</orgName> your fire as at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, for the masses of infantry, and do not withdraw your guns just when they are becoming effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It is glorious to lose guns by fighting them to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It is disgraceful to save them by retiring early from the fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> The cavalry constitutes the eyes and ears of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The safety of the entire command depends upon their vigilance and the faithfulness of their reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The officers and men who permit themselves to be surprised deserve to die, and the commanding General will spare no efforts to secure them their deserts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Almost equally criminal are the scouts who, through fright, bring in wild sensational reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>They will be court-martialed for cowardice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Many opportunities will be afforded to the cavalry to harass the enemy, cut off supplies drive to his pickets, &#x0026;c. Those who have never been in battle will thus be enabled to enjoy the <unclear></unclear> sensation of listening to the sound of hostile shot and shell, and those who have listened a great way off will be able to come some miles nearer, and compare the sensation caused by the distant cannonade with that produced by the rattle of musketry. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName>  <surname>Hill</surname></persName>,</signed>, <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>. </closer> </div3>

<head>The last Northern movement.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> The last movement on the chess board by the <rs>Northern Government</rs> is a recognition by law of the despotism previously existing in that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had waged war &mdash; he had let loose his horde of robbers and murderers upon the <rs>South</rs>, and blockaded the ports of the <rs>South</rs>--he had suspended wherever he pleased the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> writ, and filled his prisons with men who were arrested without accusation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Many of them were retained in close and painful confinement for months without a hearing, and ultimately discharged without explanation or redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>But the public voice of the <rs>North</rs> was lifted up finally against the unconstitutional measures and the outrages of personal rights of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>; and its unscrupulous partizans saw the necessity of shelling it with all powers necessary for the maintenance of its tyrannical rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>They not only did this, but they protected <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00253" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> from all responsibility to constitution and law, by legalizing all his past violations of law and popular rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Thus fortified against popular complaint and opposition with the authority over the person of every citizen to arrest him &mdash; to imprison him &mdash; and to do with him as he lists &mdash; with power over the banks and capital of the country &mdash; with authority to force the entire militia into the field &mdash; he can act independently of the next Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>To make him independent of that body, whose opposition was feared the last Congress gave to the usurper these unlimited powers and secured them to him for a term of years. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/> Thus the tyrant finds that the unconstitutional acts of Congress give him the unlimited powers of a Dictator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>He has the purse and the sword and power over the citizen, who has no protection against his oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>While he has really exercised the powers of an autocrat heretofore, they are now completely accorded to him by the <rs>Congress</rs>, and they will no doubt be exerted with a yet more ruthless and sweeping hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/> Many apprehend that this strengthening of the hands of the usurper will greatly prolong the war; that he will be enabled to carry it on stronger and longer than had Congress failed to bolster him up. This may be so. But we are not yet prepared to believe that the <rs>Northern States</rs> will lay down and allow him to drive his car over them and grind them into dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>It can hardly be possible that the remarkable changes in public sentiment which the last elections displayed are baseless and ephemeral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Nor can we regard the frequent and bold indications of sentiment in favor of the rights and sovereignties of the <name>States</name> among the <rs>Northern</rs> communities as pretended or confined to in considerable numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>People do not easily surrender their sectional attachments nor their fealty to their municipal governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Section alism destroyed the old Union; but the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, which employed sectionalism with this result, cannot itself destroy sectionalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>He cannot extirpate the natures and affections, the local loyalties of even the <rs>Northern</rs> people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/> And when we remember that it is necessary that all these must be annihilated to enable him to exercise the powers he is now clothed with, we are not ready to believe that he will meet no obstacle, no serious opposition in his Administration. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>And now we see the supple tools of the <rs>Government</rs> in Congress voting it all power and surrendering to it every right &mdash; of States and peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>Can we doubt a just providence, and fear that by this expedient is to be promoted the power and success of a Government whose inhumanity has entitled it to the execration of mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Time will develop the effects; but having faith even in some of the <rs>Northern</rs> communities, and an abiding faith in the justice of Heaven, we do not believe that the last measure of the most atrocious Government on <unclear>warth</unclear> will assist materially to avert its merited fate of utter defeat and destruction. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>But even the war, if the despotism at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> would now terminate it, would increase respect at least for the military power of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> abroad; and in view of the prodigious martial resources it has developed, would make the <num value="2">two</num> separate Confederacies more feared in the Old World than they were under a united Government.
