<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> I received your letter yesterday, and with the greatest of pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>You do not know how happy it makes our boys feel to hear from our friends and relatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I have not received but <num value="3">three</num> letters from home since I left, but I have through other mediums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We are encamped in a very nice grove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Our company is about half a mile from the rest of the regiment, and are acting as a <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The regiment is encamped in an open field, and is almost roasted every day, as the weather is very hot in the day time, and it rains most every night, and we have to sleep in the open air, as we left our tents in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, and we arrived here at <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> P. M, after a march of <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>, and we marched it in <num value="1">one</num> hour and <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. We come in double quick time the most of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The reason of our coming so quick was, that we heard carron and a <unclear>ke</unclear> in this direction, but we were too late, for the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> had retreat with the loss of <measure n="20" type="killed">twenty killed</measure> and <measure n="32" type="wounded">thirty-two wounded</measure>. This brigade was in the advance, at <unclear></unclear> they had a nigger guide, and he led them on <unclear></unclear> a masked battery, and they cut <num value="2">two</num> companies all to pieces before they could retreat from their lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We are encamped about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from them, and <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName></placeName>, and we shall attack them to-morrow or the next day. Our division is fortifying on a hill, <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> from the enemy's line, <unclear></unclear> we shall receive a lot of tar shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>(I do not know what they are.) They have been invented once this war commenced, by a man in New York, and are very destructive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> We have now about <num value="50000">50,000</num> men in our division, and shall have from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> <num value="40000">40,000</num> more before night.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> We have got <num value="100">one hundred</num> pieces of cannon and about <num value="400">four hundred</num> cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We are very sure of routing the enemy, and we are confident that we shall be in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in <num value="1">one</num> month from this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> The enemy is well fortified and has plenty of provision and arms, and we shall have some hard fights before we get through; but we are enough for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They have not shown much courage as yet. They have run before us as fast as they heard we were coming, until we got here, and I do not think they will make much of a stand here; but I do not know. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> I suppose you have heard of our journey from <placeName reg="Burlington, Mineral, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117626">Burlington</placeName> to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and it will be needless to give you a description of it; and all I have to say about it is, that we were well received everywhere with the exception of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, where we marched through the city in double file with loaded guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We are the heaviest regiment that I have seen yet, and I have seen about <num value="100">one hundred</num>, and we are praised everywhere we go for our good behavior and drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The most of the troops are riotous and disorderly, but our boys are very orderly and quiet, and we have got good officers, with the exception of our <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>; he is a regular <rs n="Methodist" type="religion">Methodist</rs> tyrant; but since we have come into the brigade he has kept very quiet; he marched us through <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with our knapsacks on, when the thermometer stood <num value="112">112</num> in the shade; the distance was <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, and <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Winfield,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> saw us, and the next day he told the <rs>Colonel</rs> that if he did any such thing again that he would have his command taken away from him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> We are the only troops that have marched with our knapsacks on in this country; but we stood it better with them on than a good many did without them, and we have as few sick as any regiment that I know of <persName n="Page,,John,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="default:Page,John,B.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Page</surname></persName> and <num value="3">three</num> other gentlemen from <placeName reg="Rutland, Rutland, Vermont" key="tgn,7015753">Rutland</placeName>, are in our camp waiting to see the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They are on a pleasure excursion through this country, and are enjoying themselves highly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>When we came through <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, I visited the <rs type="place">Marshall House</rs>, where <persName n="Ellsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Ellsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ellsworth</surname></persName> was shot, and got a piece of the stair that he stood on, and sent it home to the folks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The city is under martial law. <persName n="Ellsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Ellsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ellsworth</surname></persName>'s men are our advance guard; but they cannot be kept anywhere a great while at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They scour the country all over and steal everything that they can lay their hands to. They have stolen horses, and niggers, and cattle, and hogs by the dozen, and they will go into houses and take all of the provisions that they can find. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> When we were camped at <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, <num value="4">four</num> of them went to the house of a farmer, and the folks had their breakfast on the table all ready to eat, and the men went in took off their hats, and bid the folks &#x0022;good morning,&#x0022; and sat down to the table and cleared it of every eatable; got up, and bid them &#x0022;good bye,&#x0022; and left as cool as if the meal was prepared on purpose for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>We should starve if it were not for them; they bring us cattle of every description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They think a good deal of this regiment, and give us a good many things that they steal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We have not had half army rations since we have been in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Mother sent me a box of cakes and cheese, but that kind of stuff does not amount to much with us. We miss potatoes and other vegetables the most of anything but do not get half enough of anything from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It is so with all the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But I must close this scribble, as I have got to write <num value="1">one</num> home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>You must write often and I will write as often as I get a chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>If I am discharged in this country alive and well within a year, I shall go to the <rs>Western</rs> country and make you a visit, and shall stop somewhere in hat country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> I must close by sending much love to all, and accept much yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>I should like to have seen you before I left home very much If you can read this letter you can do better than I can. I could not get any ink to write with.

<head>National Foundry.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> The importance of a National Foundry to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> cannot be overrated, and there is no point on this continent which presents such a combination of advantages for the location of such an establishment as the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> Iron, coal, water power, and facilities of transportation, of receiving and delivering, and of labor, are the great requisites for a National Foundry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The quality of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> iron is known to be the best for this purpose in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, and <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles distant</measure> is an inexhaustible supply of coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The late <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> fully understood the unequaled advantages of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in this respect, for without any particular partiality for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, its necessities compelled it to have a large proportion of the cannon for the army and navy made here, because experience had demonstrated that our iron and shops turned out the best cannon in the country, and probably in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The neighborhood of the <orgName n="Tredegar Works" type="works">Tredegar Works</orgName>, which constructed the machinery of the largest steam frigates in the <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States Navy</orgName>, and which has rendered such important service in the construction of cannon for the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, would be a suitable site for a National Foundry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>It would be upon the very margin of the canal, and commanding an amount of water power not equaled by any town in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The canal would bring to its doors the iron and coal, and carry the works manufactured for the <rs>Government</rs> from the spot where they were made to the adjoining river, or to any other point.--It ought to be borne in mind that, no matter where a National Foundry is established, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> iron and coal would have to be used, and the cost and labor increased by transporting them from this point, where they could be conveniently had, to distant and less advantageous localities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>In addition to these advantages of the best iron, coal and water power, is the fact that <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> has an unusual number of iron foundries within her limit a some <num value="10">ten</num> or a dozen of which are on a large scale, besides various minor iron works, employing a large number of foundry men, showing the existence in this city, at the very doors of the proposed foundry, of a large amount of fixed, reliable and permanently located mechanical force, growing up with our iron interests, and which, in the event of any emergency requiring extra labor, would preclude the possibility of dependence upon aid from abroad, and thereby give certainty and permanence to the operations of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The acknowledged salubrity of this city, which is found by statistics to be the healthiest city on the <rs>Atlantic</rs> seaboard, is another obvious advantage of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> We understand that the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> owns a valuable site, adjacent to the canal, which is suitable in every respect for the purpose of a National Foundry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>No doubt she would cheerfully give this location to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> for such an object &mdash; an act of wise and patriotic liberality, which she ought not to hesitate to perform. </p> </div3>

<head>The handcuffs.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> An <address><street n="Albemarle street">Albemarle</street></address> correspondent, who seems in credulous about the handcuffs &mdash; thinking it hardly possible that our Northern invaders can be so barbarous as to bring manacles to place on Southern people &mdash; asks is it possible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We answer that it is possible, and that it is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>There are some of these handcuffs in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/><num value="2">Two</num> most reliable gentlemen--<num value="1">one</num> a surgeon in the army and <num value="1">one</num> a captain, both recently from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> &mdash; say to us that they saw the handcuffs, and also some fetters for the feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>As to the number of handcuffs we cannot ascertain with accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Estimates have been various.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The surgeon, not an extravagant gentleman, by any means &mdash; a man well known here, and not led away by excitement at any time &mdash; stated to us that he saw a large pile of handcuffs, he would suppose as many as <hi rend="italics">a <num value="1000">thousand</num>,</hi> though he could not tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Something was said about the handcuffs to the <rs>Federal</rs> prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, when <num value="1">one</num> of them, with some vehemence, declared that they were not intended for the <rs>Southern</rs> people, but their own soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Great must have been the number of anticipated desertions if that were so!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It may be that handcuffs were regarded a luxury, and reserved for the <rs>Grand Army</rs>, in which case it would be fair to infer that the large stock of liquors and sweetmeats were intended for the <rs>Southern</rs> people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>If this were the intention of our kind Northern friends, then it has been carried out, so far as to place us in possession of the liquors and good things generally!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>As for the handcuffs, we can, if we choose, place them on hands certainly very fit to wear them &mdash; hands of men who have voluntarily enslaved themselves to a despotism the most odious that ever cursed the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>But Southern people have no pleasure in employing the shackles of despots, and will not be eager to further degrade even the mercenaries of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> Certainly the handcuffs intended for loyal Southerners are in keeping with the monstrous spirit of barbarism with which the war was inaugurated by the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The <hi rend="italics">rope</hi> was another part of the equipment for the invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>When the companies and the regiments were organizing at the <rs>North</rs> during the winter, company orders for drill constantly contained the injunction upon each member to &#x0022;bring hemp&#x0022; with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Hemp was to be carried along to hang true Southern men!--Had the <rs>Northern</rs> hordes reached <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, those ropes would have been used!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>We have not a doubt of it. Once here, they would have foolishly imagined the war was at an end, and the <rs>South</rs> subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The bittered malignity, the vilest passions, would have vented themselves upon our city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Even that depraved old man, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Scott,,Winfield,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="default:Scott,Winfield,,,"><foreName>Winfield</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>,</hi> had his &#x0022;resentment&#x0022; to gratify by the woes that the brutal army he sought to let loose upon us would have visited upon cur devoted citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was not taken!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Thanks to our glorious army at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Our city was saved, and History has thus been deprived of <num value="1">one</num> of the blackest chapters ever written, to excite the pity and horror of future ages. </p> </div3>

<head>Excuses for defeat.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The Northern press has almost as many different theories to account for the late defeat as there are newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It is reasonable, as a general thing, to conclude that journalists have not much knowledge of military matters, else they would be in the army.--Men who can tell so well how a thing ought to be done, ought not to hide their light under a bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The ideas of a <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, which often confounds the most subtle plane and powerful agencies of evil men, does not enter into the idea of the infidel philosophers of the <rs>Northern</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Nevertheless it is to the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> upon Southern arms, and His interposition in bringing aid at the precise time and place that it was needed, that our success war due; and He who has been our defence in the past is our reliance in the future. </p> </div3>
