<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Provided, further,</hi> That all persons under the age of <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure> or over the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>, who are now enrolled in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, in the regiments, squadrons, battalions, and companies hereafter to be re-organized shall be required to remain in their respective companies, squadrons, battalions, and regiments for <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, unless their places shall be sooner supplied by other recruits, not now in the service, who are between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <measure n="33years" type="date">33 years</measure>. And all laws and parts of laws providing for the reorganization of volunteers, and the organization thereof, into companies, squadrons, battalions, and regiments, shall be, and the same are hereby, repealed.&#x0022;</q> </p> </q><bibl n=""></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> On the promulgation of the law, with this qualification, (without which your petitioners ever the law could never have been passed,) there was but <num value="1">one</num> construction pieced on it in the army and throughout the country, <hi rend="italics">so far as</hi> your petitioners are advised and believe; and that was, that all persons over the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> or under <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure>, who were, on the date of the law, <q>&#x0022;enrolled in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, &#x0022;</q> <hi rend="italics">should be discharged on the <date value="1862-07-16">16th day of July, 1862;</date></hi> and this without restriction, qualification or peradventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/><hi rend="italics">These were the terms of the law.</hi> They were plain, unequivocal and mandatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Commonsense &mdash; universal public opinion, concurring military, popular and official sentiment, thus understood, accepted and adopted the law. Nor was it anywhere, by any <num value="1">one</num>, or under any circumstances, otherwise spoken of, considered or regarded, <hi rend="italics">so far</hi> as your <sic>petitioneers</sic> are advised, <hi rend="italics">in or out of the army,</hi> until <rs n="General Order" type="misc">General Order</rs>, <num value="46">No. 46</num>, rescinding <rs n="General Order" type="misc">General Order</rs> No, <num value="44">44</num>, was issued by the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, under and by authority of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> That order took the country and the army by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It fell as a death knell upon the assured expectations of your petitioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>It struck the popular ear with no less astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It disclosed a new, secret, and dangerous spring of Executive and ministerial power, as unlooked for as it was novel and perilous to the spirit and genius of the revolution inaugurated on the declared principle of eternal opposition and unyielding resistance to Executive or <hi rend="italics">quari</hi> legislative encroachments on the chartered rights and constitutional privileges of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>It manifested a will to assume power where none was bestowed, or intended to be bestowed, and to exercise high retracting and annulling prerogatives where all exercise of Executive will or ministerial discretion was positively and distinctly inhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It presented a painful instance of a plain, palpable and dangerous infraction of the constitutional guaranties and vested rights of your petitioners, as declared by your honorable body, and unmistakably announced in the <rs>Conscript Act</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> Your petitioners, feeling that this interpolating order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> was a clear, palpable, and unauthorized (<hi rend="italics">by the law</hi>) infraction of their rights, consulted counsel, and procured his written opinion, which was published, and will be laid before your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>In thus seeking counsel, your petitioners were not actuated by any other spirit than that of a disposition to ascertain their legal rights, as defined and enumerated by your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>They had <hi rend="italics">volunteered</hi> without the least idea of the passage of any such law. That law, without their solicitation, not only revoked and annulled the act of their volunteering, but, in distinct terms, released them from all military service after <date value="1862-07-16">the 16th day of July, 1862,</date> <hi rend="italics">as a consideration to society and the different States</hi> for the unconditional, peremptory, and mandatory draft, which the same law made indiscriminately on the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It in express terms <hi rend="italics">released</hi> all over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> or under <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure>, that <hi rend="italics">it might claim, demand, and impress</hi> all between those ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It <hi rend="italics">discarded</hi> those over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> of age, that it might Coerce those under that age. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> This was a severe tax on the community at large, and not less severe on your petitioners as a class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It took the manhood and youth of the country, with or without their consent; but it undertook and guaranteed that all over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> or under <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure> should be discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>This was, in terms, a solemn legislative compact with the <name>States</name> and society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>As such, severe and harsh as it was, it was ratified by acquiescence, and no settled opposition was made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> You petitioners even now would greatly prefer that matters should have remained as they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>But they were disposed of by the law, and respectfully insist that what the law did the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> cannot undo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The compact made by your honorable body, if good in <num value="1">one</num> part, must stand unaltered in every part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The clause releasing your petitioners was in a proviso, and was and is paramount to the enactments in the main body of the act. It was the codicil to the legislative will, and was superior in its active powers to any and all parts of the act which might happen to conflict with it. If the retroactive interpolation entered by authority of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> repealed that proviso, according to all law and every rule of sound construction the same repealing order would annul and destroy the main body of the act. On this subject your petitioners are advised the authorities are most satisfactory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> But the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> has repealed the proviso, recalled the warrant of discharge, and placed his own construction on the whole law, and directed that your petitioners should not be discharged &mdash; the <num value="12">twelve</num>-months&#x0027; men &mdash; until the expiration of <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> after their term of service, and claims to retain all persons enlisted for the war previous to the <date value="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862,</date> for the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> Your petitioners are advised that the rights, privileges, and immunities vested in them by virtue of the proviso to the said act, are full and complete, attended by no conditions and restrained by no qualifications, and that those rights admit of no intermediate and counteracting restrictions, either from the <rs>Executive</rs> or ministerial Department of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>They aver, most respectfully, that any interpolating or retroactive orders, whether by the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>, or any <num value="1">one</num> or more of his subordinate functionaries, is in law (however they may temporarily act on your petitioners) unavailing, null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>But they are advised that, as there is in operation no judicial process by which they could test this matter as a class, their only legitimate means of redress is through your honorable body. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> There can be no question that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> laws passed by Congress are <hi rend="italics">supreme,</hi> and challenge the <hi rend="italics">obedient acquiescence</hi> of the <rs>President</rs> and every Department of the <rs>Government</rs>, until they are repealed or pronounced unconstitutional by a competent judicial tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>And any violation of any <num value="1">one</num> or more of such laws by any Department of the <rs>Government</rs>, is not less culpable than a similar violation by any other member of society. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> The reason, spirit, and intention of the law in question, as well as its words, context, and subject matter, are plain and unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>There is no point, no word, no object, no purpose, which is not fairly and plainly act forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The question then presents itself, painful, serious, and vital, shall the law prevail, or shall the intervening, unauthorized interpolation of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> prevail?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Shall an army order revoke a solemn act of Congress?--Shall Congress or the <rs>Executive</rs> rule the people, control the army, and legislate for the country? --Have we a constitutional Government, with specific powers granted, beyond which no department of the <rs>Government</rs> shall pass, or have we an unlimited Government, dependent only on Executive will or ministerial caprice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/><hi rend="italics">Are the <name>People</name> free or is the <rs>Executive</rs> supreme?</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> These are no idle questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>They are solemnly propounded, and merit a solemn response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It was legislative encroachments and Executive usurpations which destroyed the <rs>Union</rs>, never to be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Shall the <rs>Southern States</rs>, confederated, yield the same destroying element of self- destruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>The answer which your honorable body may see fit to give will descend with its weighty consequences to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The voice of history is not less potent in its warnings against Executive assumption or ministerial abuse of power than the hopes of the future are dependent on your response. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/> In view of the dangers which beset the country, your petitioners cannot better conclude their appeal than by adopting the significant language uttered by <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, in the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, on the <date value="1788-01-07">7th January, 1788,</date> when he exclaimed: <q>&#x0022;The real rock of political salvation is self-love &mdash; perpetuated from age to age &mdash; in every human breast, and manifested in every human action.--When the commons of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, in the manly language which became freemen, said to their king, <hi rend="smallcaps">You are our servant,</hi>--then was the temple of liberty complete. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> It is with no view of avoiding danger, or shunning responsibilities, that your petitioners ask their discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Their hearts, hopes, energies, are all enlisted in this war. They had rather lose all and perish themselves, than fail to maintain the cardinal principle on which this war turns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>They will never yield to an insolent foreign foe, or succumb to any power which seeks to subvert the inherent rights of the <name>States</name> or to destroy the individual liberty of the free-born citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Feeling that in this order of revocation, (<rs n="General Order" type="misc">General Order</rs>, <num value="46">No. 46</num>,) not only their rights, but the rights of the people, and the legitimate powers and functions of Congress, are invaded and endangered, they seek, the proper remedy; should their services be needed, they, and all they have, will be freely offered up on the altar of constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>But they are not prepared to yield a silent submission to the violation of their rights or the subversion of the vested immunities, when their <hi rend="italics">this papers are derived from your honorable body.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> Your petitioners respectfully ask, that they may be fully heard before your honorable body, through their counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The petitioners. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>It is believed that he intends to carry the greater part of his army to <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s assistance, leaving below only a force sufficient, with the aid of his gunboats, to keep up the system of plunder which he has inaugurated in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>We cannot imagine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> The facts are simply these: In <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> he set cut from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with an army <num value="120000">120,000</num> strong to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers were filled from day to-day, and from week to week, with the most pompous accounts of the power and numbers of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Potomac army</orgName>, its music, its parades, its artillery, its horses, its commissary stores, and the pomp, pride, and circumstance of war, with which it was surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The <q>&#x0022;rebels&#x0022;</q> formed a subject of everlasting derision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Editors and correspondents seemed never to tire in ridiculing that unhappy race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Their wretched dress, their sorry equipments, their indifferent arms, their old flint muskets, were the eternal theme of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> wit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were in the woods and had cut down trees and piled them, with the branches projecting in front, several trees deep, in front of their whole line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>It is impossible to conceive a stronger position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>As soon as the battle was about to commence, the <q>&#x0022;Little Napoleon&#x0022;</q> suddenly recollected that he had important business below, and off he rode at quarter-nag speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>There were about <measure n="200" type="sick">two hundred sick</measure> and wounded in <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, who could not be removed.
