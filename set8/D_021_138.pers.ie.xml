<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The hospitals seem to be well tended by the ladies, and their ministrations are very edifying, self-sacrificing and beneficial; yet while some are numerously attended &mdash; particularly phase on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> and vicinity &mdash; there are others scarcely visited at all, owing to their being remotes and more difficult of being reached than those located on the principal streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>That some hospitals are filled while others are not, is no fault of the ladies; for they are ready to go where their services are <unclear> ded,</unclear> and their kindness to the wounded most required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They only desire to have their labors directed by those in charge of hospitals, and will be found ready to submit at any personal inconvenience for the sake of the poor sufferers who solicit their aid. No are in passing through the streets can fail to be struck with the number of women of all characters and conditions of life, who pass him bent on errands of mercy, each with some package, basket of provisions, bouquet of flower for the wounded soldier under he charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Ladies drive through the streets with their carriages filled with luxuries; and poor woman, some perhaps needing nourishment themselves as much as those they wish to comport, pass by overburdened with trifles for the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In every building they can be seen carrying around food and water, making comfortable the beds and pillows, bending over the note, fan in hand, talking to the patient the while in a cheerful, kindly tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>And the result of this is, the wounded bear their sufferings patiently, remaining quietly in their beds while nature is doing its work, the spirits of the men are kept buoyant, and the mind freed from gloomy care and doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The good affects of careful nursing is also seen in the small percentage of deaths resulting from various wounds.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> This is a question which many persons are anxiously asking, but which few or none can answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>If some <num value="1">one</num> could tell us how the war will be conducted from this time forth &mdash; upon what principles and for what objects &mdash; we might then form some tolerably reliable opinion as to its duration and its result.--But, unhappily, the policy of the war has thus for been so undetermined, and the manner of carrying it on so fluctuating, that it is impossible to say how or when it will come to an end, or whether it will, in our day and generation, cease at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> A large majority of the people have supposed that the only real purpose of the war was, to defend the authority of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the law against the efforts of those who have attempted to overthrow them, and that as the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of States</orgName> is founded on the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the best, and indeed the only possible way of preserving or restoring the former, is by preserving the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>But since the conflict of arms began, the method of prosecuting it and the ends for which it is prosecuted, have been as various and unsettled as the views and interests of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>We believe that the <rs>President</rs> has been, and is, honestly desirous to being the <name>States</name> together again, in peace and harmony, upon the old basis of the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> But <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has not, as yet, declared for himself a distinct policy in this war, and compelled all who are under him to conform and adhere to it. As to several great fundamental questions of constitutional power and Executive duty, he has been reserved and equivocal, when he should have been explicit and determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>A striking instance of this strange want of decision is found even in his last proclamation respecting the recent atrocious edict of <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>In that case, instead of frankly and positively denying all constitutional power, either in his subordinates or in himself, to declare the abolition of slavery, or of any other institution of a State or States, under any circumstances whatever short of civil revolution, he tells us that, <q>&#x0022;whether it be competent for me, as <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the army, to declare the slaves of any State or States free, and whether at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the <rs>Government</rs> to exercise such a supposed power, are questions which, under my responsibility, I reserve to myself.&#x0022;</q> This leaves the whole question in doubt, when <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> ought to have seen that no <q>&#x0022;necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the <rs>Government</rs>&#x0022;</q> could even arise to justify such a usurpation of power as would violate the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and therefore subvert, rather than maintain, the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> This want, then, of a fixed and definite policy as to the war against the rebellion, so far as the <rs>President</rs> it concerned, has led to conflict of counsel and action, both in the <rs>Cabinet</rs> and the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, as well as in Congress--<num value="1">One</num> General excludes all fugitive slaves from his camp; another invites them to seek refuge within his lines; <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> undertakes to emancipate several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of them by a stroke of his pen. A <rs type="role" reg="Cabinet-Officer">Cabinet officer</rs>, in his report, proclaims that the abolition of slavery is a necessary incident of the war. The <rs type="place">President cuts</rs> out the passage and disavows the doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Congress, at <num value="1">one</num> time, resolves that the war is not a war of subjugation, nor designed to disturb any of the established institutions of the <name>States</name>, but intended merely to assert and enforce the authority of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws, at another time, the same body avows principles and enacts measures which are utterly inconsistent with what it had before so solemnly declared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> The result of all this is, that nobody can tell what the war is really waged for, or what is to be its issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>And the effect of this uncertainty upon the people in the revolted States is, to defeat the only just and desirable object of the war--<unclear></unclear> the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; and to protract hostilities <hi rend="italics">ad infinitum.</hi> For what reasonable hope is there that the <rs>Confederates</rs> will lay down their arms and return to their allegiance to the <rs>Constitution</rs> if the <name>Administration</name>, in its efforts to reduce them to obedience, exercises unconstitutional powers, and thereby destroys the only source of all the guarantees of liberty and equality which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> could have in the event of their coming back to their loyalty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> It not only seems like, but it is, a gross mockery and delusion, to require a people to pay obedience to Government, and yet imitate them in their disloyalty to the fundamental law from which it derives all the power and authority that he rightfully possesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>They who exact respect to law, must themselves respect law. If those who are set in authority over a people do not faithfully observe the laws they are appointed to administer, and keep strictly within the legal limitations of the powers with which they are entrusted, the people must feel that they can have no certain security for their liberties under such rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Hence comes a rebellion, or, where rebellion has preceded any despotic exercise of power by the <rs>Government</rs>, such unlawful use of power to put it down not only justifies persistence in a rebellion originally unjustifiable, but drives it to an extreme which finally involves the whole State in revolution and anarchy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> And this, we fear, is the disastrous end to which the mad passions of fanatics at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> are rapidly pushing the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Under their baneful influence, a war for the vindication of constitutional authority is fast drifting into a conflict without any aim but the conquest or extermination of several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of our own people, and without any other inspiration than that of blind resentment and hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Such a war must be barbarous, destructive, and interminable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It never, at least, can end in restoring the civil order and peace it was designed to re-establish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>If, therefore &mdash; and this is the pith and marrow of all we wish to say--<persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> desires, as we believe he does, to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> by reducing the <rs>Confederates</rs> to submission and bringing back into the <rs>Federal</rs> fold the <name>States</name> which have seceded from it, he must, in all his efforts to that end, act constitutionally. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> Every unconstitutional act to put down the rebellion, whether done by him or his subordinates, justifies the rebellion, while it encourages and strengthens it. The whole crime of the <rs>Confederates</rs> consists in their revolt against lawful authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>If, therefore, the power that is used to suppress them is unlawful, resistance to it becomes a voluntary act. The usurpation of the <rs>Government</rs> raises a criminal insurrection against its legitimate authority, into a just and laudable contest against military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>We hope, most earnestly, that the war, rightly conducted for right ends, may be successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>It amounts to about <num value="2300">2,300</num> all told &mdash; killed, wounded, and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Of these only about <num value="150">150</num> were killed, the wounded bearing an unusually large proportion to the killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>In the meantime, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> acknowledge a loss of <measure n="800" type="killed">800 killed</measure> and upwards of <measure n="4000" type="wounded">4,000 wounded</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>We doubt whether they took <num value="100">100</num> in all. </p>

<head>Exchange of prisoners.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> We would again call the attention of our authorities to the suggestion made by us the other day with regard to the exchange of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We do so because we are convinced that it is of the utmost importance to our cause, and cannot be neglected without a serious detriment to that cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> The indifference which the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> has shown to the captivity of their soldiers is singularly brutal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>There are many <num value="1000">thousand</num> of them still in our possession, and while that is so, they have, by a breach of faith unknown to the history of any other Government, doomed them to a prolonged imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The inference is irresistible.--They care nothing for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>They may suffer or not suffer, without disturbing their equanimity in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Were the majority of them of a different description, they would be ready enough to make any arrangement by which they could be set at liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Were their connections influential, or possessed of political influence, were they even <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, they would leave no means untried to procure their liberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>They would be afraid of the terrible commotion their heartless indifference would produce at home among friends and relatives, and by means of friends and relatives, through the whole community. --But the large majority of these prisoners have no such advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>They have neither relatives nor influential friends among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>They are, for the most part, men of whom they are desirous to be rid &mdash; men whom they hired to fight their battles, and for whom they have no farther use, when they are placed in such a situation that they can no longer render military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>They are, in a great measure, <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> and <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, having no political influence, and very likely to use what little they have against the wishes of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It is not to be expected, therefore, that a Government, destitute alike of faith and humanity, will exchange the gallant Southern men, taken in our privateers and at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, for creatures like these, whom they do not want, and who they think are reentering them a service by remaining in captivity, where they assist in consuming Southern provision, and bringing on, as they hope a famine in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>That is the way in which the gallant <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> hope to subdue us not by hard fighting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> Now, the state of affairs would be very different were we, whenever we have occasion to send prisoners off on parole or to exchange them for other prisoners, to give a preference always to those <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Let us keep the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--especially the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.--to the very last extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Let us always have a reserve of them on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We should be glad to hear that all <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> prisoners were paroled on the spot; but by no mean for any consideration whatever, parole a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Keep them all Keep every <num value="1">one</num>, if it cost half the provisions of the <rs>South</rs> to feed them If this policy be strictly pursued for any length of time, our word for it that there will come up a cry of distress from Yankeedom that will compel their Government to act with honesty, however much against their inclination. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>We <hi rend="italics">must</hi> retaliate severely for every murder of this kind they may choose to commit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>But it will not do to hang <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> soldiers in retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>That will have no effect whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We must hang <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the best among them that we can get. We must always keep a supply of hostages on hand, and they must be genuine <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Hitherto they have scarcely felt the effects of this war. They have contrived to put foreigners, and all the scum of their cities in the front, while, for the most part, they have remained at home, entirely out of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Since we cannot, as yet, carry the war to their own firesides, let us make them feel it as much as we can. They will feel it severely enough when we shall have hung a dozen or so genuine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/> Among the many noble and gallant spirits who bravely met death in the <rs n="Battle of Williamsburg" type="battle">battle of Williamsburg</rs>, there were none more noble and gallant than he to whose memory this tribune is offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>A native of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>, he removed at an early age to <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>, and soon won admiration from the companions of his youth, and respect and esteem from the associates of his dawning manhood, by his high sense of personal honor and strict adherence to an elevated standard of morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>His love and devotion to his native State led him to volunteer among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for the defence of her liberties, and in the army that same unswerving pursuit of principle and constant attention to duties which distinguished him in civil life soon marked him as a bright exemplar of patriotism and soldierly hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>The uncomplaining spirit and manly fortitude which he exhibited at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, amid the incessant labors, ceaseless vigilance, and various hardships necessary for the fortification and protection of that point against the advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, gained the love and friendship of men and officers, and opened the way to that advancement which, beginning immediately after the battle of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num>, in which he was engaged, resulted in his unanimous election to a commissioned office, at the reorganization of his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>In discharge of the duties of that position he entered the <rs n="Battle of Williamsburg" type="battle">battle of Williamsburg</rs>, cheered by the congratulations of friends, and followed by the blessings of officers and men alike, who proudly anticipated a brilliant and successful career for him; but a grave of glory awaited him; and the hand which waved his men to battle became nerveless, and the voice which cheered and encouraged, faint, while his mourning friends bore him from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Yet he murmured not, but assured a sorrowing friend, who would have comforted him with hope, that he knew his end was near, in that perfect spirit of submission and firm endurance which marked his whole life.--Such men may die, but cannot be forgotten.--Pure in heart, he never yielded to the evil influences which beast the soldier, but ever remained strictly observant of those rules of gentle courtesy and gentlemanly conduct which peculiarly characterized him. In the ancient city of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, the colonial capital of the <rs>State</rs> he loved so truly, and the birth place of that liberty for which he died, among kindred spirits, the gentle and courteous, brave and gallant of former days, his body sleeps; but the memory of his many virtues remain to inspire and animate those who knew him in the army, and comfort the relatives who mourn their loss.
