<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>So far as we could learn not a gun was fired yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> they proceeded on up the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>, and that night we hear of them at <placeName reg="Chesterfield Station">Chesterfield Station</placeName>, on the <orgName n="Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad</orgName>, <placeName><distance reg="14miles">fourteen miles</distance> beyond <placeName reg="Ashland, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2110477">Ashland</placeName></placeName>, and at <placeName reg="Colman's Mill">Colman's Mill</placeName>, <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> still further on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Since the above was written we have learned something more of the movements of <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s raiders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>What their purpose was in taking this circuitous route is not known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is to be hoped that proper measures have been adopted to obstruct their progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Our cavalry have now a line opportunity to distinguish themselves by putting a final check upon this bold raiding party of <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s.

<head>From the <rs>Southside</rs> &mdash; a demonstration near <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Information was received last evening that a force of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry, under <persName n="Kantz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Kantz,nomatch:0"><surname>Kantz</surname></persName>, approached <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> on the south side of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, and about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> afternoon made their appearance in front of that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The local forces <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engaged them, and lost <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6" type="killed">six killed</measure> and about the same number wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This engagement took place within our outer line of fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They were subsequently attacked by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> and driven back, after which they retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This was certainly a bold attempt on the part of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They probably relied upon the assurance of a runaway negro, that <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> was ready to surrender, and doubtless expected to enter the city with flying colors; but they found out their mistake before the close of the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> This movement explains the frequent advances of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry towards <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> recently, which may now be regarded as reconnaissances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Various rumors were in circulation last night relative to the demonstration above alluded to, <num value="1">one</num> of which was that the enemy actually got inside of the city, and were mowed down by batteries posted in the streets; but nothing was known of this in official quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We learned at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> that a dispatch was received at <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time>, stating that the enemy had been repulsed, and we have good authority for saying that they got no nearer to the city than the <orgName n="Water Works" type="works">water works</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The troops engaged on our side were <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Dearing,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Dearing,nomatch:0"><surname>Dearing</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, a part of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, and the local forces.--Some few of the latter are reported killed, among them <persName n="Friend,Mister,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Friend,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Friend</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jones,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Jones,W.,E.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, druggist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, at last accounts, were retreating through <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The object of these <num value="2">two</num> raids &mdash; starting almost simultaneously on the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> sides of the river &mdash; is obviously to embarrass our transportation and cut off our means of communication. </p> </div4>

<head>The fight near <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> We have received some additional particulars of the fight near <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton, Va.</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is stated that the battle opened at <time value="11am">11 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>During this period the enemy made several desperate assaults upon our position, but were in each instance repulsed with loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>His fall created some confusion in our ranks, and caused our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> to give way, thus necessitating the retreat of the centre and right to prevent being assailed in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Our troops fell back in good order to <placeName reg="Waynesboro, Waynesboro, Virginia" key="tgn,2114939">Waynesboro</placeName>', about <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles distant</measure> from the battle ground, where at last advices they were in position to defend the mountain gape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Our loss in the fight has been estimated as high as <measure n="400" type="killed, wounded and missing">400 killed, wounded and missing</measure>. --The enemy's casualties are believed to have been heavier than ours, from the fact that they made the assaults, and were repulsed Indeed, <persName n="Vaughan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Vaughan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName>, who succeeded <persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Jones,W.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, telegraphed that we inflicted more loss on the enemy than we sustained, and that though having been by over whelming numbers compelled to fall back, we lost nothing, but brought off all our artillery and wagons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> In addition to the loss of <persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Jones,W.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, it is reported that <persName n="Alken,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Alken,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Alken</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="52TNRegiment">52nd Tennessee regiment</orgName>, was killed, and <persName n="Vaughan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Vaughan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName> slightly wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>For this reason our victory on that day caused more exultation throughout the <rs>Confederacy</rs> than has ever been felt since, even upon the most extraordinary occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It was our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victory, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victory to a people for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time at war, is like the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> love, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Cav">first horse</orgName>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dog, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pair of boots, to the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>It was hailed as a harbinger of success throughout the war. It begat a confidence which did not leave us until repeated reverses had taught us the true nature of the difficulties with which we had to contend. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> In comparison with the gigantic battles that have since been fought, the <rs n="Battle of Bethel" type="battle">battle of Bethel</rs> was a mere skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Yet when judged by its effects, it was <num value="1">one</num> of the most important battles of the whole war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They had previously been made to believe that the <rs>South</rs> was inhabited by an effete and effeminate race, who might perhaps swagger and threaten as long as there was anything to be gained by big words and bold assumption, but who would give way upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> application of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The prevalence of this belief is apparent in all the speeches of their leading men &mdash; in all the leaders of their newspapers &mdash; in the proceedings of all their military conventions &mdash; in the habitual conversation of their guardroom, as recorded by their press &mdash; in the resolutions and proceedings of all their public meetings, and in the correspondence of all their diplomatic <hi rend="italics">corps.</hi> <measure n="90days" type="date">Ninety days</measure> was the extreme limit which the most moderate among them assigned to the &#x0022;rebellion,&#x0022; as the assertion of their rights by an independent people was facetiously termed.--When <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> sent his <num value="6">six</num> regiments from <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> Comfort and <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport's News</orgName>, to sweep <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> out of his path, he no doubt believed that the operation was easy of performance, that it would open the way for him to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and that he would meet old <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> there at least as early as <date value="07-04">the 4th of July,</date> or perhaps anticipate his arrival, and take all the glory for his own peculiar share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>How could such a force stand before <num value="6">six</num> regiments of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> blue coats &mdash; New York firemen and reg-legged Zouaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The shock which he must have received from the intelligence that his forces had been not only repulsed, but routed like a flock of sheep; that they had not attempted an orderly retreat, but had fled through the woods and over the fields, throwing aside their guns and knapsacks, and even their shoes, must have operated powerfully on his excited fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>He saw that he had undervalued his adversary, and he resolved never to be guilty of the same folly again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The lesson there taught sunk deep in the mind of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldier, and he has not yet forgotten it.
