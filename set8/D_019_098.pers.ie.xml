<item>Text validation, generation of authority lists, final tagging. Several military advertisements have been missing. I keyed in 6 advertisements (5 of which were at the bottom of column 6 on page 2). There was another advertisement that I keyed in on page 1. If the advertisement was an ordinance, I keyed it in because many of the other ordinances were keyed in. This file was not consistent with what was keyed in and what was left out. Some ordinances were keyed, some where not. Some military files were keyed, some were not. Sent to DDD for corrections, where Header was over-written and intial corrections were possibly also over-written (contrary to explicit instructions). This file is returned to DDD with the version of the file (corrected by DDD, with over-written Header) sent to UR, which has "_rev.xml" appended to the filename. Files must be compared and any changes in the version corrected by UR must be retained in version corrected by DDD. </item> </change> </revisionDesc> </teiHeader>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>These are too commonly regarded as mere excrescences, and that little is necessary but to scrape or cut off the external surface; whereas, the eradication of them, and that in a manner not to injure the flesh, is an operation of great care and delicacy, that can only without danger, be performed by <num value="1">one</num> who has made that branch of surgery the special object of attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The extraction of teeth, and the cure of diseases in them or in the gums, were, a few years ago, considered as legitimately within the province of any <num value="1">one</num> who was dubbed a Surgeon, till experience taught that that branch of the healing art required special application and study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Few, now, who have the means, think of employing any but a regular dentist to attend to diseases affecting the teeth. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> incidentally refers to the prudent caution observed by the fleet off <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> during the bombardment of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, and pays a high compliment to the <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> for their forbearance before, their heroism during, and their magnanimity after the bombardment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>He recommends the appointment of other diplomatic agents. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> In conclusion, the <rs>President</rs> congratulates the <rs>Confederacy</rs> on the patriotic devotion exhibited by the people &mdash; men in high official and social position and wealth serving as volunteers in the ranks &mdash; the railroad companies liberal in their rates of transportation of troops and supplies, and in the proffer of terms for the transportation of the mails, receiving in compensation the bonds of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>He says a people thus united and resolved cannot fail of final success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>We feel that our cause is just and holy, and we protest solemnly in the face of mankind that we desire peace at any sacrifice, save that of honor and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>We seek no conquest &mdash; no aggrandizement &mdash; no concessions from the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>All we ask is, to be let alone, and that none shall attempt our subjugation by force of arms. --This we will and must resist to the direst extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The moment this pretension is abandoned, the sword will drop from our grasp, and we shall be ready to enter into treaties of amity and commerce, mutually beneficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>So long as this pretension is maintained, with a firm reliance on that Divine Power which covers with its protection the just cause, we will continue to struggle for our inherent right to freedom, independence and self-government. </p> </div3>

<head>Sensations of taking chloroform.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/> A correspondent of the <rs type="place">San Francisco</rs> <orgName n="Weekly Mirror" type="newspaper">Weekly Mirror</orgName> gives the following vivid description of the sensations he felt while under the intoxication of chloroform, in which he had been placed for the purpose of having sliver of iron extracted from his eye: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> &#x0022;My last sane recollection is of the surgeon applying the handkerchief to my mouth; then the room began to magnify to gigantic proportions; a common lamp was transformed to a candelabrum, more luminous and costly than ever lighted the grandest cathedral in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The surgeon became a giant of prodigious magnitude, holding a huge, gleaming knife, with a single blow of which he might have severed me. The sound of voices in the room seemed like the clamoring of a vast multitude during the burning of a city, and a sign-board, screeching outside, conveyed the idea of a furious mob collected in the street for my execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>On entering the room I had noticed a large cat sitting asleep on a shelf, which turned its head lazily toward me and then resumed its slumbers; this creature became a hideous, vampire-like monster, with great fiery eyes, and with fangs and claws like what were fabled to belong to the griffin, walking round, and blowing fetid breath on me, and pressing its frightful paws on my breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>But the worst of all was a collection of gigantic men sharpening instruments for my dissection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>I could hear the whirring of the stone and the shrieking of the highly-tempered knives as the grinders laughed at the intended dissection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/><num value="1">One</num> was more jocose and heartless than the rest; he was my implacable enemy; we had quarrelled and fought about a schoolmate love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Presently I felt their keen knives at every joint; I shrieked and screamed, blasphemed and besought my tormentors, but still the instruments hissed through my quivering flesh and grated along every bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>I am satisfied that all these emotions were experienced within a moment after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inhalation which began the process of stupefaction &mdash; so swift are the evolutions of thought when sense is subdued, and when the phantom monarch of dreams leads the soul through the endless avenues, swifter in its journeying than the short-lived fire which falls from the womb of an overburdened cloud. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/> &#x0022;But a gradual revolution of mental perception succeeded; those frightful specters began to recede; the men and knives began to diminish; the cat returned to his natural proportions and crept slowly away; the voices became less harsh and threatening, and the noise in the street was subdued to unbroken silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>I looked into a universe of light, with nothing visible, until indistinct forms appeared on the horizon, coming toward me and defining themselves as they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/><num value="1">One</num> was my mother, clad in grave-clothes, but, as she neared, her habiliments changed to the fabrics which glittered in the prophet's vision when he looked over the &#x0022;great congregation which no man could number.&#x0022; Directly she stood by me; and, recognizing every feature, I saw that each age-mark was gone; her cheek was fresh as the young girl's when she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blushes at the whispered words of love, and, stooping to kiss me, the apparition went out, leaving another, still more beautiful and youthful; it was the figure of my young wife, who died in the birth of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>She held an infant in her arms, who reached down and ran his tiny fingers through my hair, but when I tried to take him in my arms, infant and mother were gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Strange, that I felt no disappointment; I knew they were but pictures that hung in the galleries of a father's heart.--Everything changed to an existence of indescribable pleasure; I laughed and danced like <num value="1">one</num> mad with the exhilaration of unexpected deliverance from torture; the air came into my lungs gratefully as the up-gushing of cool water to the lips of a thirsty drinker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The aroma of celestial gardens seemed about me; I believed that I was in the territory of souls, and wondered how any <num value="1">one</num> should fear to die. I could hear sounds in the street, but they seemed to prolong and swell like the sound of a great organ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/><num value="1000000">Millions</num> of symmetrical creatures passed in review, along a horizon of <rs type="color">silver</rs> and <rs type="color">gold</rs>, and yet I was conscious that they were but the creations of a distorted imagination. </p> </q><bibl n="San Francisco Weekly Mirror"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/> &#x0022;Presently I became conscious of returning sense; my limbs felt unwieldy and of too great proportions to be moved by the strengthening will; my eyes opened and began to discern objects returning to natural dimensions, and I began to comprehend the conversation of persons in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The whole operation had not occupied half an hour, but I had lived centuries of indescribable horrors, and emotions of happiness which are incomprehensible to the sane and wakeful mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>My sight was preserved, and the fragment of steel is in my possession, which, like the key of <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName>, unlocked the celestial splendors and opened a Pandora box of hellish imagery, which, even now, scares me from dreams to sudden and trembling wakefulness. </p>
