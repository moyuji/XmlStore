<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>These buildings have for some time past been used as a sort of headquarters for <num value="1">one</num> of our cavalry regiments on duty in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The records and public documents which were kept in these buildings extended back for nearly <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>, and must have been of very great importance to the inhabitants and property owners of the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The moving column of soldiers, artillery, army wagons and horses filled the road for miles as it moved along.--There were not many residences along the road, and some of them had been abandoned by their former occupants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The few inhabitants who remained appeared to be very much astonished to see us passing in such force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>They pretended to have had no communication with their rebel friends or with <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName> for a long time, and to be in complete ignorance of what had lately transpired in the outside world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>They were very anxious to know if it was a movement of our whole army or only a portion of it for some particular purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Their rebel proclivities caused what their caution could not entirely disguise &mdash; the exhibition of their rejoicing at the thought that we were going away.--although they generally made professions of neutrality, and denied having any part in the war, &#x0026;c. <num value="1">One</num> fact is especially noticeable in this State, and I have round it almost invariably wherever I have been, and that is the absence of all young or middle-aged men. A persevering inquiry will usually disclose the fact that they are with the rebel army, although most generally their friends claim that they have been forced away under the <name>Conscription</name>, or volunteered to save the disgrace of having been drafted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>There are to be found on the plantations only women, old men and children.--The negroes who are able to be at any service are also mostly gone, some having been removed down <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> by their masters for safety, and the balance having sought refuge within the lines of our army, where, of course, they cannot be pursued, and are thenceforth free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>They are truly reaping the bitter fruits of secession, and the worst is yet to come.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> All along the line of our march the houses were visited by stragglers from our army, of whom there will always be many, in spite of every exertion possible to prevent it. The occupants of these houses, in some instances, appeared highly indignant because guards were not stationed, as formerly, to guard their property and prevent intrusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>They thought it extremely hard that they should be compelled to contribute towards the support of the army in any way. --Poultry and fruit rapidly disappeared, and many a soldier's mean that night could boast of a few addition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>In some instances what was taken was <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> paid for, but in more they were in too great a hurry to rejoin their regiments to settle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The suffers acknowledged however, that their friends of the rebel army treated them with no more regard for their vested rights; but what seemed to afflict them most severally was the thought that the hated <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> should have the benefit of Secesh property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Of course this pillaging by soldiers as they pass through even an enemy's country must be condemned, and when detected and proved, must be punished for the good of the army itself, which such practices tend to demoralize; but still it is undoubtedly a severe temptation to <num value="1">one</num> who has for weeks lived on salt pork and lard bread to see a young and fat fowl within close proximity to him. </p>

This day's march witnessed a repetition of the previous onslaught upon the poultry and orchards of the secesh inhabitants by the stragglers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>As a general thing, they were civil, however, and willing to pay for what was taken, when requested to do so. Large quantities of unripe fruit and melons were devoured, which will most probably cause a material increase of cases of diarrh&#x0153;a and dysentery, and refill the regimental hospitals, which had been cleared of their occupants preparatory to this movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>There was also a very general disappearance of fowls of all kinds, and poultry has become a very common article of diet in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Many of the soldiers were seen to carry, in addition to their arms and accoutrements, extra rations in the shape of turkeys, chickens, geese and ducks, which by the noise they made, had evidently been but recently served out to them (?), and were yet in many instances alive and kicking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Just before entering <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, I noticed an enterprising private by the side of the read, under the shade of a large tree, with some half dozen half ripe watermelons spread out before him, which he was disposing of to his less fortunate comrades at the moderate rate of <measure n="50cents" type="currency">50 cts</measure>, each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>How he became the owner of this valuable merchandize is unknown to your correspondent, but that his profits equaled the total of his receipts, I have no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>He was not a native <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, but a Hibernlan, and <num value="1">one</num> who evidently with the reckless generosity and profession characteristic of his countrymen; combined the thrift and shrewdness which is supposed to belong to the natives of the land of his adoption. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> The Secessionists of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, as elsewhere along the route, were much rejoiced to see our army making a retrograde movement, anticipating that soon this part of the peninsula also would be surrendered to the rebel rule again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The colored population had taken the alarm, and were very anxious to learn what the future had in store for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Some of the more indiscreet of the rebel sympathizers, upon learning that we were evacuating our position upon the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, indulged in threats of what should be done to them when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>This increased their alarm and agitation, and the exodus of this class of the population, most of whom had been the slaves of fugitive rebel masters, has already commenced, and probably a few days will see the town relieved of nearly all of them, and but a very few will remain to experience the tender mercies of their secesh friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Between the action of the rebels in carrying their slaves down <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> and the operation of military rule, the peninsula has been pretty well cleared of the more valuable portion of the slave property &mdash; those who are left generally being either of ancient or very tender and juvenile age, neither of which are of much profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Practical emancipation has taken place, and those who have not availed themselves of its benefits are of the class who are either too old, to young, or too shiftless to do so. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>It is stated that he was busily engaged yesterday in running bullets while our troops were passing through the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The avowed purpose of these preparations was to stop the departure of the contrabands after the expected withdrawal of our forces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> At an early hour this morning the march was resumed, and continued in an orderly manner until <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> was reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>There was no danger of an attack, and there did not exist the necessity for any special care in making the advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Nothing worthy of note occurred, and <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> was reached soon in the afternoon, and the weary soldiers encamped in the old camp, made familiar to most of them by a <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> residence during the famous slege of the rebel fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Here they remained and rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The marching was beginning to tell upon the men, and there were a good many stragglers who had fallen out of the ranks.--The <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">Provost guard</orgName> was constantly employed riding to and fro upon the road, hurrying them up; but in spite of their exertions they came slowly in by twos and threes, and sometimes squads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Most of them rejoined their commands in the course of the day and evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The scenes of the previous <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> were repeated along the route, although not to so great an extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>It was, however, highly dangerous for poultry to show itself in any close proximity to the soldier. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The main street has been filled in and raised <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure>, and everything possible has been done to make the village a healthy and respectable place of residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The earthworks and entrenchments built by both our own and the rebel troops remain intact, and by their extent and massiveness, show with what perseverance and energy both parties contended for the possession of the locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The authorities resorted to the punishment of death with extreme reluctance, and at last only because they saw that nothing else would do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> It has been said that these men did nothing more than what they saw others continually doing, and that it was hard to punish them alone while there were so many others guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>We do not exactly see the force of this argument, nor can we understand why it is any extenuation of <num value="1">one</num> man's guilt that another man has been guilty likewise.--The clemency of the <rs>Executive</rs> has had a most disastrous effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>If it was designed for kindness, it has turned out to be anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of those cases in which mercy is the greatest cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The absolute necessity of putting a stop to the practice is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>It is a practice which, more than any other, is encouraged by example.--If a firm stand had been taken in the beginning, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man who deserted his colors been punished, there would have been an end of the thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>But when the soldiers saw men deserting everyday, and brought back without being punished, what was more natural than that many of them should imitate the example!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We are aware that this punishment came upon these soldiers with the force, somewhat, of an <hi rend="italics">expost facto</hi> law. They had seen so many go unpunished that they believed nobody would be. Nor was it likely that they should conceive themselves to be doing anything very wrong, when they saw so many others doing the same thing with impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Yet they knew the law and the penalty it imposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>They had no right to believe that they could violate it with impunity, because others had done so. We have heard it said that the authorities ought to have made a proclamation of their intention hereafter rigidly to enforce the law. Perhaps it would have been better and we hope, even now, it will be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>But still, even if they did not do so, there is not a man in the army who does not know that desertion is punishable with death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Should no such proclamation be made, however, it is now at least well understood that the consequence of desertion will be fatal henceforth for the rest of the war. It will not do to trifle with this law. The salvation of the country depends upon its execution with the utmost fidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Every man who has any conception of the fearful extent to which the crime of desertion has gone, will at once be convinced of this fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>It is <sic>supererogatory</sic> to plead the hardship of individual cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Every man in the ranks can with perfect truth present a case full of hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>All have been called to the service of the country at enormous sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>All have given up home, friends, everything that makes life desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>What would be an excuse for <num value="1">one</num> man would be an excuse for all. To place the question upon individual cases is to dissolve the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>To say that a man has fought gallantly is no excuse, although a man who fights gallantly is not apt to desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The rule is positive, absolute, irrefragable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>It must be so, or there can be no army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> We hope the <rs>President</rs> will take this occasion to issue a proclamation offering pardon to all deserters who will return to their colors by a named day, and distinctly declaring that he will not interfere to prevent the death penalty in any case of conviction for the same offence thereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>We hope, too, that Congress will pass some law enabling him to get rid of unworthy and incompetent officers.--It is they who are the really guilty parties in most cases of desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>It is their criminal neglect of duty that occasions the entire relaxation of discipline which leads to it. If there is no law to punish them let <num value="1">one</num> be made. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
