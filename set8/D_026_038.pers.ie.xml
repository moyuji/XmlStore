<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He alludes to the latter's assignment to a defined geographical command, by <rs n="Special Order 275">Special Order No. 275</rs>, which order described the command as including a portion of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Georgia</placeName>, the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and that portion of the <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">State of Louisiana</placeName> east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>We make the following extract from this letter: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> When I learned that prejudice and malignity had so undermined the confidence of the troops at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> in their commander as to threaten disaster, I deemed the circumstances such as to present the case foreseen in <rs n="Special Order 275">Special Order No. 275</rs>, that you should repair, in person, to any part of said command whenever your presence might be for the time necessary or desirable. &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> You were therefore ordered, on the <date value="05-09">9th May,</date> to &#x0022;proceed at once to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and take chief command of the forces, giving to those in the field, as far as practicable, the encouragement and benefit of your personal direction.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> Some details were added about reinforcements, but not a word affecting, in the remotest degree, your authority to command your geographical district. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> On the <date value="06-04">4th June</date> you telegraphed to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> in response to his inquiry, saying &#x0022;my only plan is to relieve <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>My force is far too small for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Tell me if you can in crease it, and how much.&#x0022; To which he answered, on the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">5th</day></dateStruct>, &#x0022;I regret inability to promise more troops, as we have drained resources even to the danger of several points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>You know best concerning <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>; but I fear to withdraw more.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> On the <date value="06-08">8th June</date> the <rs>Secretary</rs> was more explicit, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>He said: <q>&#x0022;Do you advise more reinforcements from <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>You, as commandant of the department, have power so to order, if you in view of the whole case, so determine.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> On the <date value="06-10">10th June,</date> you answered that it was for the <rs>Government</rs> to determine what department could furnish the reinforcements; that you could not know how <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s wants compared with yours; and that the <rs>Government</rs> could make the comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Your statements, that the <rs>Government</rs> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was better able to judge of the relative necessities of the armies under your command than you were, and the further statement, that you could not know how <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s wants compared with yours, were considered extraordinary; but, as they were accompanied by the remark that the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s dispatch had been imperfectly deciphered, no observation was made on them till the receipt of your telegram to the <rs>Secretary</rs> of the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> inst, stating &#x0022;I have not considered myself commanding in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> since assignment here, and should not have felt authorized to take troops from that department, after having been informed by the <rs>Executive</rs> that no more could be spared.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> My surprise at these <num value="2">two</num> statements was extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>You had never been &#x0022;assigned&#x0022; to the <rs>Mississippi</rs> command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>You went there under the circumstances and orders already quoted, and no justification whatever is perceived for your abandonment of your duties as commanding General of the geographical district to which you were assigned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> Orders as explicit as those under which you were sent to the west, and under which you continued to set up to the <date value="05-09">9th May,</date> when you were directed to repair in person to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, can only be impaired or set aside by subsequent orders equally explicit; and your announcement that you had ceased to consider yourself charged with the control of affairs in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, because ordered to repair in person to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, both places being within the command to which you were assigned, was too grave to be overlooked; and when to this was added the assertion that you should not have felt authorized to draw troops from that <orgName n="Department of the Tennessee" type="department">department (Tennessee</orgName>) &#x0022;after being informed by the <rs>Executive</rs> that no more could be spared,&#x0022; I was unable to account for your language, being entirely confident that I had never given you any such information. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> I shall now proceed to separate your <num value="2">two</num> statements, and begin with that which relates to your &#x0022;not considering&#x0022; yourself commanding in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> since assignment &#x0022;here&#x0022;--i. c., in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> When you received my telegram of the <date value="06-15">15th of June,</date> informing you that &#x0022;the orders to go to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> did not diminish your authority in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, both being in the country placed under your command in original assignment,&#x0022; accompanied by an inquiry about the information, said to have been derived from me, restricting your authority to transfer troops, your answer on the <date value="06-16">16th June</date> was: &#x0022;I meant to tell the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> that I considered the order directing me to command here as limiting my authority to this department, especially when that order was accompanied by <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> orders transferring troops from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> This is, in substance, a repetition of the previous statement, without any reason being given for it. The fact of orders being sent to you to transfer some of the troops in your department from <num value="1">one</num> point to another, to which you were proceeding in person, could give no possible ground for your &#x0022;considering&#x0022; that special order <num value="275">No. 275</num> was rescaled or modified. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> Your command of your geographical district did not make you independent of my orders as your superior officer, and when you were directed by me to take troops with you to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, your control over the district to which you were assigned was in no way involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>But the statement that troops were transferred from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> by orders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, when you were directed to repair to the latter State, gives but half the fact; for, although you were ordered to take with you <num value="3000">three thousand</num> good troops, you were told to replace them by a greater number, then on their way to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and whom you were requested to divert to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The purpose being to hasten reinforcements to <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>, without weakening <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>This was in deference to your own opinion that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> could not be safely weakened &mdash; say, that he ought even to be reinforced at <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>'s expense, for you had just ordered troops from <orgName n="command"><persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> to reinforce <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>I differed in opinion from you, and thought <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> far more exposed to danger than <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, and was urging forward reinforcements to that point both from <placeName reg="Carolina, Itawamba, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056113">Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, before you were directed to assume command in person in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Maclure pointed to a chair on which were <num value="3">three</num> passports, and remarked &#x0022;there are the passports--<num value="1">one</num> of them is yours, and you are to go by the name of <persName n="Redford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="nearbymention:Redford,F.,C.,,"><surname>Redford</surname></persName> &mdash; the other <num value="2">two</num> I have persons to assume them.&#x0022; The names of the persons for whom these passports were made out were <persName n="Redford,,F.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="default:Redford,F.,C.,,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Redford</surname></persName>, <persName n="Huntly,,R.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="default:Huntly,R.,C.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Huntly</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Phillips,,J.,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="default:Phillips,J.,B.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The doctor then told me he could not go that evening, but that I must meet him at his office at <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Next day I called at the appointed time, and found Maclure's wagon waiting in front of his office, with a coffin in it. Fearing that my appearance in this wagon on the public street would excite some suspicion, (so I told the doctor,) I declined getting in at that place, and remarked that I would get up somewhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>He suggested on <address><street n="17 Street">17th street</street></address>, near the <rs type="place">Old Market</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>I went there, and soon after Maclure drove up. As I jumped up into the wagon, he got out and went a short distance up the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Soon after, he came back and remarked that he had heard from <persName n="Kirby,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="nearbymention:Kirby,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Kirby</surname></persName> I was a Government detective, and that &#x0022;if you are you had better be saying your prayers; for I'll bed &mdash; d if I don't shoot you.&#x0022;--He looked like he would do it, too. I told him I was sincere in my motives &mdash; not to mind what K. said; had nothing to do with him, anyhow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>This seemed to satisfy him, and we drove off.

We soon got into conversation, when he remarked that perhaps we were going the same way. He said he was going North; hoped he would succeed in getting there, &#x0026;c. Nothing further of interest occurred till we reached the picket post where <persName n="Craddock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="nearbymention:Craddock,Robert,,,"><surname>Craddock</surname></persName> and <persName n="Rees,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="nearbymention:Rees,John,,,"><surname>Rees</surname></persName> were, and at which we halted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> It is said, with, we hope, no just cause, that the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> intend to defeat the plan proposed by <persName n="Smith,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Francis,L.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> for rendering the protection of the country against raids more efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>We cannot see the sense of such a proceeding, and we are well convinced that it will not be popular.--The people have already suffered too much from these marauding expeditions, the avowed object of which is to produce a famine in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>A great outcry was raised against Congress for placing on the list of conscription men over <num value="45">forty-five</num> engaged in agricultural labors, and the reason given was that, unless a sufficient number was left at home, supplies of provision could not be raised, and a famine must come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It strikes us that such famine will fully as likely be the consequence of destroying the crops after they shall have been raised, as of never putting them in the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> It has been said that we cannot prevent these raids by an armed force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We can, nevertheless, greatly diminish their number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We can compel the marauders to act in large bodies, and thus greatly circumscribe the sphere of their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We can by this means greatly reduce the number of slaves and cattle which they may have it in their power to carry off. We very much doubt whether we may not put an end to such exploits altogether by placing on a war footing a sufficient number of men, always ready to assemble and give battle on the shortest notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>When <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00278" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>'s men passed through the country last summer they moved as though the avenger of blood were behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They expected to be attacked, and were ready to fly at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance of an armed force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Had there been such a force they would all have been killed or captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The mere fear of encountering such an <num value="1">one</num> saved the country from a degree of pillage infinitely more destructive than that which it experienced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> We hope the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> will think twice before they put this bill to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The country require such measures as it inaugurates, and will not be satisfied without them. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
