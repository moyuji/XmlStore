<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>In conclusion he said: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> The permanent destruction of a harbor was not justified by the laws of war. [Hear, hear] War undoubtedly sanctioned many grievous acts, but it did not sanction any act of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>[Hear] The permanent destruction of a harbor was not an act of war of man against man, or of nation against nation, but it was an act of war against the bounty of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, which had vouchsafed harbors for the advantage of commerce and for the civilizing influences of intercourse between <num value="1">one</num> people and another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>[Hear, hear.] On this ground we were well entitled and were bound to enter a protest against such acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>[Hear, hear.] He wished to hear from the noble <rs>Earl</rs> whether there reports were well founded, and, if so, whether he had taken, or designed to take, any steps in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He should also wish to know whether the noble <rs>Earl</rs> had received any communication from the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> on the subject, and whether the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, to his official knowledge, had made any similar representations to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with respect to the destruction of the port of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> said the <rs>Government</rs> had no official information on this, subject subsequent to that which had already been laid on the table of the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>However, the sinking of vessels at the mouth of a harbor was an operation of so much importance that he could not but believe that the reports which had appeared must have some foundation.--He was happy to hear the noble <rs>Earl</rs>'s protect against the permanent destruction of any against the permanent destruction of any harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Considering that these were commercial harbors, and that in time of peace, when there was severe weather, vessels of all nations, even those not ultimately destined for them, ran there to find refuge, to destroy them was undoubtedly an act of barbarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The noble <rs>Earl</rs> would have seen that the reply of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government was that these stone vessels were intended to be an obstruction in the channel to aid the blockade, but that they were not intended for the permanent destruction of the harbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>In conversing with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Minister at this Court, that was the view which he took.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>He said that the permanent destruction of <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> was impossible; that the <num value="2">two</num> rivers which formed the harbor would be sure to make a channel, and that it was impossible, even if it had been intended, to effect the permanent destruction of the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>That, he said, however, was not the intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The intention was only to make a temporary obstruction, and when peace was restored that obstruction would be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>That, he believed, was the view taken by the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>There had been some communication between <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government and that of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> on this subject, with regard to which the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Emperor</rs> took the same view as that of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her majesty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But whether <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> had made any official representation on the matter to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, he was not able to say. </p> </q><bibl n="Earl of Stanhope"></bibl></cit>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> The Federal Government is again at its work of hostility to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>More stone laden ships have been sunk in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, to compel the destruction which was intended, but not achieved, by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>What have their friends to say for them now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The excuse urged for their atrocity by Americanized <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> has been, in plain words, want of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>We were told that they had not completely blocked up the harbor; they had only injured it. Some of their advocates had the impudence to assert, or the inconceivable folly to believe, that no more than this was intended &mdash; that it was desired, not to destroy the entrance, but to make it difficult and dangerous, with a view to facilitate the operations of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>If it had been so, it is not easy to see that the crime would have been thereby lessened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>To deprive the world at large of a gift of nature so valuable as an excellent, harbor is an outrage on civilization, and an offence against all commercial nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It is a violation of neutral rights similar to that involved in the paper blockade which it is intended to assist &mdash; an attempt to deprive neutral vessels of that trade with <num value="1">one</num> belligerent which cannot be lawfully interrupted by the other, except under certain well-defined conditions, which such an operation is expressly meant to evade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It is, therefore, an act which might justly be treated as a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">carus belli</foreign></hi> by any or all nations having commercial relations with the port so assaulted.--But the sinking of ships with a view, not to class the entrance, but to render the navigation perilous, is a crime of a much more atrocious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is an endeavor to expose to risk of shipwreck vessels only liable at worst to capture, and seamen not liable to any penalty whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It is, in <num value="1">one</num> word, a practical conspiracy against neutral seamen if they attempt to enter a harbor which, by all the laws of nations, they have a perfect right to enter <hi rend="italics">if they can</hi>--a trap laid for the lives of the subjects of friendly powers such as could not legitimately be employed even against civilian enemies, and, therefore, an act which would put its perpetrators outside the pale of civilization, and entitle neutrals to deal with them not merely as enemies but as pirates. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>A grain of common-sense would most people would fancy, have enabled the writer of the above calumny to come to the conclusion that, were the commander of the <rs>Sumter</rs> so prone to murder as he supposes, he would hardly have taken the trouble to incumber himself with the crews of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> merchantmen he destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>In former days, when the <hi rend="italics">Debats</hi> was impartial, it would have abstained from recording the cowardly insinuation without a word to protest against it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The affair became known, and the <rs>French</rs> people were terrified to find that for so small an amount the <rs>Government</rs> was forced to go to borrow money in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>All sorts of rumors were started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The <hi rend="italics">Monitsur</hi> denied the fact of the loan at a time when all knew it, and, the <rs>Government</rs> gave orders to the agents in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to let the affair drop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>So ends that farce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Its effect, however, is deplorable here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The masses are frightened, and, as usual with the <rs>French</rs> when they become so, they also become cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>It is more than probable they will, at least the great majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>An undefined dread of some kind of retaliation will force them to do so. The commercial classes in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> are in dismay.
