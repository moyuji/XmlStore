<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> We are proud of the spirit of our Governments, Confederate and State, relative to this question of holding and defending this State to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The army will not abandon the <unclear> red </unclear> soll of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>That has been made the battle-ground, and on that must the enemy establish his superiority in fair fight before it will be abandoned to him. The evacuation of the see-coast positions and cities became a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>There was no avoiding it, in consequence of the immense advantage enjoyed by the enemy in his possession of the entire Navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the material and mechanical skill for the rapid construction of iron-clad gunboats, while we had neither a Navy, nor the material and the mechanical force, to enable us to compete with him in any sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>It is true, we had the <rs>Virginia</rs>; but, besides her, nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Her destruction, and the questions it involves, suggests matters of debate which afford neither satisfaction nor benefit now to discuss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Our inability to meet the enemy on the water, as a general question, was clear and indisputable, and the withdrawal from the sea unavoidable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>All the means in the power of the <rs>State</rs> and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are pledged to this, and we may be assured that the enemy will not be allowed to gratify the prominent desire of his heart, to hector and domineer over the inhabitants of this far-famed and beautiful town, until every means is exhausted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The cause would be, indeed, itself well nigh surrendered in that event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The Government is not only just, but wise, in its determination to stand by <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to the last. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>His withdrawal gives time for further preparation for his next essay, which will certainly be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Our loss is slight; but more than in some instances, where important positions have been surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>We trust that this beginning is an earnest of the determination to keep the gunboats back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>They have been felt by our artillerists, and some idea may be formed of their real capacity and power for evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The men who man our guns are somewhat more reliable than the militias who have been entrusted with guns at some points where it was most important we should make good our defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Seamen are the best of gunners, and it has been a great mistake to leave them nothing to do while the cannoneers in many cease has been left to men who were not at all to compare with them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> The public spirit here is the best imaginable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The people are ready to make any sacrifice to defend the place, and are entirely averse to surrendering it at all to the gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>They will cheerfully submit it to destruction <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, according to the disposition of both the <name>Governments</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> The successful resistance thus far has been highly encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>But this encouragement should only be to put forth increased exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>We should strengthen and increase the number of our obstructions, and we should strengthen our batteries and increase the supporting force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> Nothing is wanting in disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>It is only necessary for the leaders to give the proper direction to the labor and the defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>This being properly done, it may yet be proved that gunboats are not invincible, nor can they go where they please. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="4"> 
<head>The dead at the batteries.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> We think it would be an act proper and to creditable to the city to vote a pension to the families of the dead who perished in the special service at the river batteries to defend this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Also, to pension any who may be permanently disabled in the same way. We are sure it would meet the unanimous approval of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The service is especially for the protection of this city from an invading foe whose impelling move is greed and gain, and whose policy is designed to humiliate and crush the pride and spirit and erase the nationality of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>In this temper, what night we not apprehend were they to get possession of the <rs>Capital</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>Confederacy</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Therefore, every motive of patriotism and honor should stimulate our people to resist to the last the most efficient and dreaded form of the invasion, which aims at the cities of the <rs>South</rs>, and which is directed at this with all possible malignity and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>In this especial act of resistance we should enlist every feeling sacred to the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Honor to all who shall distinguish themselves in it, and let none suffer from the death or disability of any of our gallant defenders, who are killed or wounded at the batteries in protecting the city. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>I love sinners and mourn over their sins, and at times feel moved to remonstrate with them Some listen to what I say, others make light of it&#x0022; I inquired by what means he had been converted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>He replied that a religious book had been given him by the <rs>Chaplain</rs> of his regiment, (the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL20">20th Alabama</orgName>,) the reading of which forced upon him the conviction that he was lost and helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>He looked to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and was soon rejoiced in a sense of forgiveness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> Another expressed himself substantially in the same way, having been converted from reading a little book while on service in the camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> A youth of <num value="16">sixteen</num> summers and of pleasing countenance seemed deeply interested in religious matters, and several times remarked, with great emphasis, <q>&#x0022;I do wish I was a Christian.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> I met another with whom on previous occasions I had conversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The peculiarity is, therefore, the extreme height, which is greatly increased by the arrangement of the trimming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>As the shape precludes the possibility of side trimming, the lace and flowers that beautify the inside are disposed in flowery bandeaux across the forehead, or inclined a little to the <num value="1">one</num> side.
