<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Not only was the foreign public ignorant of the <rs>South</rs>, but it desired to remain ignorant; and neither sought nor would tolerate information concerning the true state of Southern affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The South was a tabooed subject, except as a butt for abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Her slave-drivers, and slave institutions, were standing themes of execration; we were the <hi rend="italics">bete noir,</hi> the pet abomination of the popular mind, a subject of conventional obloquy and execration.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> --It is an easy matter to find fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It is only necessary to be self-conceited, querulous and dyspeptic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Any man with these qualifications can criticize <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName> or <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>There is no work of man's hands, no statue or painting, no oratorical achievement, in fine, nothing human, which is perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>In every thing earthly may be found a flaw, and it is the instinct of fault-finders to alight upon that flow, and direct the attention of others to it. Their use in this world is to disenchant the mind of man of its proneness to idolatry, and its tendency to look for that perfection here which cannot be found short of Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Nothing, in the economy of Nature or <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, exists in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Thus, buzzards and fault finders all have their uses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> It is chiefly in seasons of prosperity that a fault-finding disposition finds full scope for it energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In times of great misfortune and real peril, men are less disposed to grumble than in the sunshine of good fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>When real danger is at hand, the sky dark and the roar of the breakers audible, the clamor of the most complaining tongue gives place to silence, solicitude, and a hard struggle for life or death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>When the tornado puts forth its wildest fury upon the ocean, the waves are pressed down to the smoothness of a mill pond, and not till it releases its grasp are they able to rise up again and free and fume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>In like manner the pressure of some vast, impending peril hushes for a time the growling and grumblings of the most restless and discontented.--But it is only for a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>With a returning sense of security and success, there is leisure to criticise the very means by which that security and success have been achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The disposition of men and dogs is not as different as their physical conformation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Many a <unclear>dos</unclear> will keep perfectly quiet during a thunder storm, and as soon as it is over, come out an bark furiously at the slightest noise or the smallest provocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Physicians consider irritability and querulousness a sign that the patient is convalescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>If that be true, the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is out of all danger; for the disposition to &#x0022;pitch in&#x0022; to the physicians and nurses of the <rs>State</rs>, and the household generally, would seem to indicate that the crisis of the disease has passed, and that the body politic will soon be in a state of complete salubrity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> To declare that the new Southern Government has committed errors and blunders, that it is not perfect, immaculate and infallible, is simply to assert that it is human.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>We are no the apologists of any Government or any party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Undoubtedly this Government has sometimes &#x0022;done things which it ought not to have done,&#x0022; and &#x0022;left and <num value="1">one</num> what it ought to have done&#x0022; The best men in the world make that confession substantially every <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.--In the main, however, it has done well; as well, we think, as any other leader would have done under the same circumstances; better than there was any reason to expect; a good deal better than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Thomas,B.,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, with all the money, means, and men of the <rs>North</rs> at his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>We feel confident therefore, that the <rs>Southern</rs> people in the late election for the <name>Presidency</name> and Vice Presidency have given, by a universal vote such a testimony of their approval of the leaders of their own choice, and thoroughly them, of the great <rs type="role" reg="military-Captain">military Captains</rs> to whom we are indebted for our safety, as will convince the whole world, both in the <rs>North</rs> and <rs>Europe</rs> that, however, we may inherit the grumbling propensities of our <name>English</name> ancestors, we are, nevertheless, a united people with no taint of Toryism or Unionism.--the same thing under a different name &mdash; in our views, and that reconstruction is as impossible as subjugation </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> We should be among the last to deprecate the very freest discussion of the merits and conduct of the <rs>Southern Administration</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>A wanton abuse or error ought to be exposit and assailed in the most vigorous and unsparing manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But, at least for the present, lemere fault-finders forego their pet luxury Otherwise, the world will say of us that we are a peevish, fickle, discontented race, who will never be satisfied in any Government under Heaven; that we have just cast off <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Thomas,B.,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and are now as anxious to be rid of <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>; that those who dissolved the old Union a year ago are getting ready to dissolve the now, and will are long be precipitated into remediless chaos and ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>This has always been the prediction of open enemies abroad and of secret traitor and tories at home, who are stealthily fanning every spark of discontent in the vain hope of insuring the fulfilment of their malignant prophecies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Let us never forget that we cannot expect perfection in any human Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Let us be thankful for the good we have; for the independence, the security, the renown, and for that grand and glorious future which must be our own if we are true to ourselves and our country. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> Our boys have already displayed their aptitude in the use of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>We learn from authority worthy of confidence that during the memorable and glorious combat at <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, the musket at short distances and the bayonet were alone used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The latter weapon proved itself highly serviceable in several sweeping and irresistible charges.--The enemy never waited to cross bayonets with us, but shrunk terrified from the gleam of the terrible weapon.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/> In fact the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers have not alone mere animal courage: that is equally an attribute of the <rs>North</rs>, and is <sic>commmen</sic> to almost all nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>They are peculiarly distinguished by their impetuosity, fire, recklessness of life, and determination to do or die. --Such men possess the stuff of which heroes are made, and every individual composing our armies adds his own particular individuality and energy to that of the mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The best thing to be done with soldiers of this stamp is to place them in situations where they cannot be held afar off by the power of artillery, and from whence they can be hurled like thunderbolts against the foe. The experience at <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> proves not merely that the <rs>Confederates</rs> understand and can practice charges with the bayonet, but that the diligent use of that fearful weapon is <num value="1">one</num> of the most certain means of routing the foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The batteries, during the course of construction, were providentially uninterrupted by a single hostile shot, though several attempts were made from time to time by the <rs>Federal</rs> ships to discover their whereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Just as they were coming abreast, the <rs>General</rs> accordingly gave orders to bring them to, and the battery accordingly opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>They endeavored to shy off towards the <rs>Maryland</rs> shore, but shot after shot struck in such quick succession as soon as this attempt was discovered, that both the tug-boats cut loose from their chargers, and taking the crew started off as fast as steam could carry them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Several rifled shots were fired at these, and again the admirable character of our shooting was exemplified, by the boring of holes in the stern of <num value="1">one</num> and the sides of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>They escaped, but information has since reached headquarters that <num value="1">one</num> has sunk near <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian's</rs> Head, and will prove a total loss. </p>
