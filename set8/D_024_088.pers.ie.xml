<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> The period is approaching when the great issues of the war will be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>From our army we may expect everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Let us expect but little from foreign powers, but be ready to make the best of the condition of things abroad, and by a wise foreign policy endeavor to make them tend to our advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>I trust the day will hasten; that, stimulated by the dangers which surround us, we shall remain united; that our Constitution may be maintained sacred, that territory may be added to our limits, and that we may emerge from the scenes of war with our liberies unimpaired either by usurpation at home or tyranny abroad. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/> The recent appeal put forth by the <rs>President</rs> to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, ought to excite a patriotic resolution in every locality to give every exertion possible to the sustenance of the army and support of our national cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>It is indeed time that the people should arouse themselves to the necessity of standing by the country in this hour of difficulty and danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>It is time to sink individualities and make everything secondary and subsidiary to the common cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The rage for speculation and the greedy passion for acquisition have not only wrought the most demoralizing affects throughout the country, but have increased the embarrassments and difficulties in the way of the <rs>Government</rs>, in its exertions to support the army and administer its affairs at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Indeed the <rs>Government</rs>, through the tricks, stratagems and brands of speculators and extortioners, finds itself besieged by an enemy at home more threatening and harder to check than the invading armies of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>The question for the people to consider is, shall they look on and make no effort to aid the <rs>Government</rs> in its struggle with the depraved and heartless enemy at home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Of what value to them will be all they have without independence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>Even were the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to leave them their property, it could afford to any but the most sordid no remuneration, no solace, for their surrender of liberty and their deep humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would not even allow them their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>There is no recourse left to any patriot, to any men of proud spirit and honest heart, but to stand by his country and his Government at all hazards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Duty and honor allow of no alternative, and even sordid selfishness can derive no encouragement from the probable consequences of any but this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/> It is the duty of as all to rise to the support of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Every producer should strain his powers to increase his contributions for the support of the army, and every man in every walk in life should honestly and patriotically set his face and his acts against the disastrous schemes of the heartless speculators upon the necessities of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>They are, by their devises, giving to every necessary of life the most extravagant and fabulous prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>They make the alleged depreciation of the public money the scapegoat for their crimes, which are bringing upon the people and the army serious embarrassments.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> But we trust there is patriotism and wisdom enough, and enough of the self-sacrificing spirit, in the nation to check the war upon the <rs>Government</rs> at home, and avert the dreadful disasters which must flow from the uninterrupted course of the plundering system of trade now carried on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>No nation on the globe has <num value="1">one</num> equal to it. Nothing but the wildest and most depraved speculation and selfishness at home can impair its credit or embarrass its means of ultimate payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>If the people will only make the most partial exertions in support of the <rs>Government</rs> and to discount penance and check the mad spirit of speculation &mdash; if they will only, each man, do a little to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> the appeal so frankly and earnestly made by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, all will go well.
