<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> --<q>&#x0022;Beware of demagogues,&#x0022;</q> said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>,</hi> in that <persName n="Address,,Farewell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Address,Farewell,,,"><foreName>Farewell</foreName> <surname>Address</surname></persName> to his countrymen, whose wisdom has elicited the warm approbation of even such a tory as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Alison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Alison,nomatch:0"><surname>Alison</surname></persName>,</hi> and whose patriotism it would be impossible to question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The Father of his Country was, in our humble judgment, <num value="1">one</num> of the wisest <hi rend="italics">uninspired</hi> men that the world ever saw. He read few books, but <num value="1">one</num> of those which be <hi rend="italics">did</hi> read was the great volume of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He knew man well &mdash; the whole race of man &mdash; but especially man as he is found in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It needed no deep acquaintance with the history of ancient republics &mdash; no Grecian or <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> lore &mdash; no examples of the dead and buried past &mdash; to teach him what man was, and what he might become under peculiar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Above all, he understood the character of the animal which goes by the name of demagogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He had had experience of it in the army, and at the council board.--He knew that the demagogue was the most dangerous of all enemies to the cause of popular freedom and human rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He had no occasion to study the history of those republics which had fallen before their machinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He knew the demagogue, and he knew what he would do if he were allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Time has proved that his anticipations were but too correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Not quite <measure n="62years" type="date">sixty-two years</measure> have passed since the whole nation was stricken down by the news of his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The great republic, of which he was the father, has already been overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The demagogue worked his way into the very heart of the tree of Liberty, that while he was living spread abroad its branches like the cedars of <placeName reg="Lebanon, Russell, Virginia" key="tgn,2112632">Lebanon</placeName>, and invited all the oppressed of the earth to take shelter beneath its shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Its leaves <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> began to grow yellow, its branches began to decay, its trunk became sapless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Everything gave token of the deadly worms that had fastened on its heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>At last it fell, and the sound of the fall startled the remotest nation of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It fell not before the cannon shot of the enemy, or the axe of the pioneer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Its fate was destined to the creatures coiled around its vitals &mdash; the meanest and most contemptible of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> creation &mdash; the demagogues it nourished with its sap. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> Nowhere has the influence of the demagogue been so fatal as in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Nowhere has the soil produced so many of the breed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Nowhere have the ravages of the insect been so destructive of the vital principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The demagogue rules <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> as his own special province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Sold himself, body and soul, he has managed to sell her, too. He has brought her into a position from which she can neither advance nor retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>She is tied to the stake, and must stand the brunt of a civil war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The impudence of the demagogues who are feeding on the life-blood of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, exceeds in boldness anything of the kind it was ever our fortune to witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>They proclaimed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that she was to be neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>They attempted to carry out their idea of neutrality by allowing Federal troops to take possession of all the strong points in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>When they found that the occupation of a portion of the <rs>State</rs> by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> was about to produce a corresponding movement by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, they raised a howl that could be heard beyond the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>They were great advocates of neutrality, as long as it did not interfere with the military operations of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>As soon as the <rs>Confederates</rs> moved, they raised their united voices against it. It was no violation of neutrality for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to establish a camp of <num value="10000">10,000</num> men on the soil, preparatory to invading <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It is a palpable violation of neutrality for the <name>Tennesseeans</name> to enter and attack these men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> There can be no doubt of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>There will be civil war in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and a very bloody <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The descendants of the old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> settlers, with a very few exceptions, will stand by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But unfortunately <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is cursed with a heavy <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> population, chiefly residing along the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>These will not only resist, themselves, but they will bring over their brother <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> to help them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our friends will prevail in the end, and when they do, we hope they will drive every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> off the soil of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> --As a matter of interest to the people and to the revenue officers of the different counties, it may be well for us to state the determination of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> in regard to the agents who will be appointed for making the assessments and collecting the taxes of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>It is known that under provision of the <rs>Confederate</rs> law levying a direct tax, any State which shall pay its quota of the same into the <rs>Confederate Treasury</rs> by the <dateStruct value="-04-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> next, will be entitled to a discount of <num value="0.1">ten per cent</num> on the amount assessed against it. This discount is probably rather more than the expense which will attend the collection of the tax from the people, and therefore any State paying in its quota by the date specified, may save a small percentage of the amount to its people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> As this saving, however, cannot be great enough to afford much temptation to the <name>States</name> to undertake the collection of the <rs>Confederate</rs> tax, the <rs>Government</rs> will doubtless have to appoint assessors and collectors of its own in many of the <name>States</name> for the purpose.--Looking to this probability, we understand that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> is maturing instructions to the <rs>Confederate Marshals</rs> on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>We understand that an important feature of these instructions will be a requirement upon the <name>Marshals</name> <hi rend="italics">to appoint for the assessment and collection of the <rs>Confederate</rs> tax the same officers in all the counties which perform similar duties for the <rs>State Governments</rs>.</hi> We understand that these instructions will be <hi rend="italics">mandatory,</hi> and that the <name>Marshals</name> will be left no option in the matter. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> While the policy thus resolved upon avoids the invocation of a countless swarm of office- seekers throughout the land, it removes in great measure the most odious feature of direct taxation, in relieving the people from the annoyance of <num value="2">two</num> sets of tax-gatherers dinning their demands into each ear at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>In the great majority of cases the officers who will assess and collect the <rs>Confederate</rs> tax, will be men of the people's own selection: and, whenever not of their own choosing, they will be the appointees of their own county courts.
