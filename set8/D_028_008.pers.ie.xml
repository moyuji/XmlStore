<head rend="italics">The right Man in the right place.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> History abounds with proof of the vital importance to a cause of having the right man in the right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It makes just as great a difference in every department of national affairs as it does in those of an individual what kind of head is upon its shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>No matter what the resources, what the courage of a people, all must prove unavailing unless, in the control of its finances and its armies, the right man is in the right place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> This truth was strikingly exemplified in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> not long before, and during, the <rs>French Revolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>When the great financier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><persName><foreName>Neckar</foreName></persName>, assumed the control of the finances of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the <rs>Government</rs> was most severely pressed by the money derangement; all was confusion, discord, darkness, mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The influence of a master mind produced the most extraordinary change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was like the rising of the sun dissipating the shades of night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, <persName><foreName>Neckar</foreName></persName> changed a deficit of <num value="35000000">thirty-five millions</num> of francs into a surplus of <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> without imposing a single new tax of any kind, and under all the burdensome expenses which had been added to those of the former peace establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But he was unfettered by any other department, and was clothed with full power to do whatever his own judgment dictated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>His resignation of office was a signal for the return of all the confusion and is order which had preceded his administration, and which finally led to the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>When he was again called to the direction of affairs, it was, in his own mournful words, &#x0022;too late.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <persName n="Carnot,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Carnot,nomatch:0"><surname>Carnot</surname></persName> is another memorable example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When he undertook the military administration of the <rs>Republic</rs> the crisis was truly appalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The remnant of Dumourier's army was flying from a foe who would have laughed at <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> a day; a rebellion in La Verdee menaced the capital of the province with <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> armed peasants; <num value="3">three</num> Spanish armies were advancing from different points; town after town after town had fallen; <placeName reg="Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhone, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur" key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> and <persName n="Lyons,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lyons,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyons</surname></persName> had separated themselves from the <rs>Government</rs>, and an <orgName n="English fleet" type="fleet">English fleet</orgName> was in the harbor of <placeName reg="Toulon, Stark, Illinois" key="tgn,2030419">Toulon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The Republic seemed ready to drop an unresisting prey into the hands of a hostile world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But behold what the genius and energy of <num value="1">one</num> man, in the right place, can accomplish!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In a brief space of time the whole scene was changed; the invading armies driven back at all points, and the anticipated victim of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> became its terrible conqueror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of <persName n="Carnot,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Carnot,nomatch:0"><surname>Carnot</surname></persName>'s military administration, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> victories, <num value="8">eight</num> of them in pitched battles, were gained; <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> successful actions; <num value="116">one hundred and sixteen</num> regular fortresses or great towns taken, and <num value="230">two hundred and thirty</num> lesser forts carried; <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> of the enemy slain, <num value="91000">ninety-one thousand</num> made prisoners, <num value="3800">three thousand eight hundred</num> cannon and <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> muskets captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But <persName n="Carnot,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Carnot,nomatch:0"><surname>Carnot</surname></persName> was not only the right man in the right place; he possessed that indispensable quality of a great mind, the capacity of selecting the right men for the right places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He discovered the merits of the illustrious <rs>Hoche</rs> when <persName n="Hoche,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hoche,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoche</surname></persName> was only a sergeant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He placed <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> at the head of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName></orgName> when he was a young officer of <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, and was wholly unknown to the world except by the dispositions he had made in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> for <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> fighting the <name>Battle</name> of the <name>Sections</name> and his conduct at the siege of <placeName reg="Toulon, Var, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur" key="tgn,7008794">Toulon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The destinies of nations and of men depend upon the right man being in the right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>A country may be on the verge of ruin, and yet be redeemed by the adoption of this principle in every department of its government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Without it, the most powerful country is constantly exposed to ruin. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Scouts report that the land and naval forces recently operating against this place, under the command of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> and <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>, were at <placeName reg="Morehead City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075757">Morehead City</placeName> and <placeName reg="Beaufort, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2073632">Beaufort</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> last, waiting for orders from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The land force was estimated at <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men and the flotilla at <num value="123">one hundred and twenty-three</num> sall, including <num value="10">ten</num> iron-clads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The enemy freely admitted that they were badly beaten at <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and say they have not seen or heard anything of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> since the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It was supposed, however, that he had returned to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.--it was not known at <placeName reg="Beaufort, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2073632">Beaufort</placeName>, even by the highest officers, whether the expedition would return to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, or renew the attack upon <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, or make a descent upon some other point on the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It is hardly probable that another attempt will be made against the defences of this harbor, at least for some time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Even if fresh operations be decided upon, it will require time to refit and patch up and get ready the necessary supplies of food and ammunition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> We know not to what extent the vessels of the armada were damaged; but it is not believed here that many of them were so much disabled that they cannot be repaired for future use. They fired at long range, as I learn from <persName n="Lamb,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lamb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>--the monitors about <measure n="1800yards" type="distance">eighteen hundred yards</measure> and the wooden hulls about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>. <num value="2">Two</num> <persName n="Brooke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Brooke,nomatch:0"><surname>Brooke</surname></persName> guns, upon which much reliance was placed, burst after a few discharges; and the <rs>Armstrong</rs> gun, a magnificent piece, occupied a position on the sea face where it could not be brought to bear upon the enemy except at long intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It was fired <num value="3">three</num> times &mdash; on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day, I believe &mdash; at <num value="3">three</num> wooden vessels, and at each discharge a vessel was seen to withdraw from the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><persName n="Lamb,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lamb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName> was ordered not to waste his ammunition, in the hope that the fleet would come to close quarters, if it did not attempt to pass the fort; and hence, during the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> the battle was waged, only <num value="1262">twelve hundred and sixty-two</num> shots were fired by the fort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> I do not know that it has been stated in any of my former letters that <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, or rather the defences of the <rs type="place">New inlet</rs> or eastern entrance to the harbor of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, consists of <num value="2">two</num> lines of detached batteries nearly at right angles to each other, bearing the <num value="1">one</num> on the bar and channels, and the other on the land approach &mdash; the latter a formidable curtain, extending from the sea beach across to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Nowhere except at <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places are there <num value="2">two</num> guns together, but each gun is separated from its neighbor by a traverse both on the right and the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The traverses are <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure> long, <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> wide at the base, and about <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The number and size of the traverses furnish the key to the very small loss sustained by the garrison and the small number of guns dismounted by the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Indeed, the protection afforded by the traverses against an enfilading fire from the sea is perfect, as was shown on both days of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>There are other features of the fort I should be glad to mention, if it were prudent, which add greatly to the safety and efficiency of the garrison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The fort has been erected since the beginning of the war principally under the direction of <persName n="Whiting,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Whiting,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Whiting</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the best engineers in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>--perhaps in any army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is built entirely of sand; the superiority of which over dirt, brick and stone, as a material in the construction of forts, is now generally conceded by experienced engineers, at least in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>A cannon ball or bolt, fired into a bank of earth or soil, will cut a clean, well-defined hole, as through a cake of cheese; whereas sand presents greater resistance and closes up behind the shot; in other words, it stops up its own cracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The greater resistance opposed by sand arises from the fact that it is composed of an infinite number of small wedges or angular particles, which are forced together by compression &mdash; wedged in, as it were &mdash; so that the greater the pressure the greater is the resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The more shot, therefore, there are fired into a work constructed of sand, the firmer, and stronger it becomes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>And hence, too, the profile of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, notwithstanding the terrible fire to which it was exposed, and the large number of enormous missiles fired into it, remains perfectly intact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> &#x0022;The superiority of our cavalry has been frequently and signally demonstrated in the latter years of the war, but never more so than during this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The causes of this superiority are not difficult to be found. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> &#x0022;Early in the war the rebels armed their cavalry with the sabre, but latterly its use has been almost wholly discontinued, and the navy revolver put in its stead.-- Our troops have never laid it aside; and in this they have an advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Its moral effect is very great &mdash; far greater than any <num value="1">one</num> can believe who has heard the terrible clanking of a grand cavalry charge and listened to the words of a veteran trooper as he describes a regiment swooping down like an avalanche on the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The appalling fanfaronade, and the clattering din of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> sabre-sheaths, and the glitter of as many keen blades in the air, has a terrifying <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> effect, which it will not do to scout at when we remember how the rebels scared our regiments often in the beginning of the war with their mere yelling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> &#x0022;Again, the rebel cavalry has become a mongrel of organization &mdash; half cavalry, half infantry &mdash; which performs well the functions of neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Instead of the light carbine used by our men, they carry the long, heavy <placeName reg="Enfield, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2317638">Enfield</placeName> or <name type="weapon">Springfield rifle</name> of the infantry.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> &#x0022;The last, and by far the most efficient, cause of the superiority of our cavalry is found in the <unclear></unclear> that most of the rebels ride their private horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Contrary to the received, popular opinion, this practice is a source, not of strength, but of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>There is no more potent relaxer of discipline than to allow men to use their own horses instead of those furnished by the <rs>Government</rs>.
