<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He asserts that the political connection between the people of the city and State has been used by the latter to the injury of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He thus concludes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> How we shall rid ourselves of this odious and oppressive connection, it is not for me to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is certain that a dissolution cannot be peaceably accomplished, except by the consent of the <name>Legislature</name> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Whether this can be obtained or not, is, in my judgment, not doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Deriving so much advantage from its power over this city, it is not probable that a partisan majority will consent to a separation &mdash; and the resort to force by violence and revolution must not be thought of for an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We have been distinguished as an orderly and law abiding people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Let us do nothing to forfeit this character, or to add to the present distracted condition of public affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> And, no doubt can be said in favor of the justice and policy of a separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It may be said that secession or revolution in any of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would be a subversion of all Federal authority, and, so far as the <rs>Central Government</rs> is concerned, the resolving of the community into its original elements &mdash; that, if part of the <name>States</name> form new combinations and governments, other States may do the same.--<placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, and her sisters of the <rs>Pacific</rs>, will no doubt set up an independent Republic, and husband their own rich mineral resources. --The Western States, equally rich in cereals and other agricultural products, will probably do the same. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Then it may be said, why should not <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York City</orgName>, instead of supporting, by her contributions in revenue, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> the expense of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, become also equally independent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>As a free city, with but a nominal duty on imports, her local government could be supported without taxation upon her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Thus we could live free from taxes and have cheap goods nearly duty free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In this she would have the whole and united support of the <rs>Southern States</rs> as well as of all other States to whose interests and rights, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, she has always been true. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> It is well for individuals or communities to look every danger square in the face, and to meet it calmly and bravely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>As dreadful as the severing of the bonds that have hither to united the <name>States</name> has been in contemplation, it is now apparently a stern and inevitable fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We have now to meet it with all the consequences, whatever they may be. If the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is broken up, the <rs>Government</rs> is dissolved, and it behooves every distinct community as well as every individual to take care of themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> When disunion has become a fixed and certain fact, why may not New York disrupt the bands which bind her to a venal and corrupt master &mdash; to a people and a party that have plundered her revenues, attempted to ruin her commerce, taken away the power of self government, and destroyed the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of which she was the proud <placeName reg="Empire City, Owyhee, Idaho" key="tgn,2317375">Empire City</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Amid the gloom which the present and prospective condition must cast over the country, New York, as a free city, may shed the only light and hope for a future reconstruction of our once blessed Confederacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Yet I am not prepared to recommend the violence implied in these views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In stating this argument in favor of freedom, &#x0022;peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must,&#x0022; let me not be misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The redress can be found only in appeals to the magnanimity of the people of the whole State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The events of the past <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> have no doubt effected a change in the popular sentiment of the <rs>State</rs> on National politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> He summed up his argument very calmly, read from a written paper, in a measured, legal tone, the causes of differences, and then concluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>This conclusion fell like a telling shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He spoke coolly of the approaching dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the contest that might ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He enumerated the horrors of civil war; alluded to the probability of the <rs>South</rs> not being able to defend herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>As he reached the close, he had <num value="1">one</num> hand in his pocket, the other negligently toying with a vest chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He balanced his head a little to and fro, in a true professional manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Only his black eyes showed the emotion he must have felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They were elongated, as <persName n="Rachel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Rachel,nomatch:0"><surname>Rachel</surname></persName>'s sometimes became, when at her stillest, most concentrated points of acting &mdash; the quiet curse in <persName><foreName>Camille</foreName></persName> for example &mdash; scintillating with light; a faint smile, just a little scornful as he said: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> He let go of his vest-chain and put his other hand coolly into his pocket, and, as he half turned to take his seat, he added: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> Any sectional organization is <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It is hostility to another section in some way or other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>And in communities where such organizations occur it is absolutely necessary for peace and order, and to prevent separation, that, even in the ordinary elections, the equality of sections shall be preserved by electing officers alternately from the different divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>If this be so even in municipal and State matters, how much stronger are the feelings of sectionalism in a Confederacy of States, and how much more imperative it is that measures of equality shall negative their dangerous tendencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>But sometimes we dream something has happened, and the dream is so like reality that you are not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> person, little woman, who has stood out that the thing has really happened.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> &#x0022;But indeed it was not a dream,&#x0022; said Ailsie, beginning to cry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> Just then <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00477" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName><surname n="Chadwick"></surname></persName> and <persName n="Chadwick,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00478" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> came down looking grave and discomposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>All during breakfast time they were silent and uncomfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>As soon as the breakfast things were taken away and the children had been carried up stairs, <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00479" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> began, in an evidently preconcerted manner, to inquire if his nephew was certain that all his servants were honest, for that <persName n="Chadwick,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00480" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> had that morning missed a very valuable brooch which she had worn the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>She remembered taking it off when she came home from Buckingham Palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>It was answered by the housemaid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/> &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, was any <num value="1">one</num> here last night while we were away !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/> &#x0022;A man, sir, came to speak to Norah.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/> &#x0022;To speak to Norah ! Who was he?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>How long did he stay !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> &#x0022;I'm sure I can't tell, sir. He came &mdash; perhaps about <num value="9">nine</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>I went up to tell Norah in the nursery, and she came down to speak to him. She let him out, sir. She will know who he was, and how long he staid.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> She waited a moment to be asked any more questions, but she was not, so she went away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/> A minute afterward <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00482" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> made as though he were going out of the room, but his wife laid her hand on his arm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> &#x0022;Do not speak to her before the children,&#x0022; she said, in her low, quiet voice. &#x0022;I will go up and question her.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> &#x0022;No, I must speak to her. You must know,&#x0022; said he, turning to his uncle and aunt, &#x0022;my missus has an old servant as faithful as ever woman was, I do believe, as far as love goes; but, at the same time, who does not always speak truth, as even the missus must allow.--Now, my notion is that this Norah of ours has been come over by some good-for-nothing chap (for she's at the time of life when they say women pray for husbands--&#x0027;any, good <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, any,&#x0027;) and has let him into our house, and the chap has made off with your brooch, and ma'appen many another thing beside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>It's only saying that Norah is soft-hearted, and doesn't stick at a white lie &mdash; that's all, missus. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> It was curious to notice how his tone, his eyes, his whole face was changed as he spoke to his wife, but he was the resolute man through all. She knew better than to oppose him; so she went up stairs, and told Norah her master wanted to speak to her, and that she would take care of the children in the meanwhile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/> Norah rose to go without a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Her thoughts were these. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> &#x0022;If they tear me to pieces, they shall never know through me. He may come &mdash; and then, just <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> have mercy upon us all, for some of us are dead folk to a certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>But <hi rend="italics">he</hi> shall do it, not me.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/> You may fancy, now, her look of determination as she faced her master alone in the dining-room, <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00483" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName><surname n="Chadwick"></surname></persName> and <persName n="Chadwick,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00484" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> having left the affair in their nephew's hands, seeing that he took it up with such vehemence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> &#x0022;Norah, who was that man that came to my house last night !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> &#x0022;Man, sir !&#x0022; As if infinitely surprised; but it was only to gain time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> &#x0022;Yes, the man that <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> let in; that she went up stairs to the nursery to tell you about; that you came down to speak to; the same chap, I make no doubt, that you took into the nursery to have your talk out with; the <num value="1">one</num> Ailsie saw, and afterward dreamed about, thinking, poor wench ! she saw him say his prayers, when nothing, I'll be bound, was farther from his thoughts; the <num value="1">one</num> that took <persName n="Chadwick,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00485" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName>'s brooch, value <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>. Now, Norah, don't go off. I'm as sure as my name's <persName n="Openshaw,,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00486" reg="default:Openshaw,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> that you knew nothing of this robbery, but I do think you've been imposed on, and that's the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Some good-for-nothing chap has been making up to you, and you've been just like all other women, and have turned a soft place in your heart to him; and he came last night a-lowering, and you had him up in the nursery, and be made use of his opportunities, and made off with a few things on his way down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Come, now, Norah, it's no blame to you, only you must not be such a fool again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Tell us,&#x0022; he continued, &#x0022;what name he gave you, Norah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>I'll be bound it was not the right <num value="1">one</num>, but it will be a clew for the police.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/> Norah drew herself up. &#x0022;You may ask that question, and taunt me with my being single, and with my credulity, as you will, <persName><roleName n="Master">Master</roleName> <foreName>Openshaw</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>You'll get no answer from me.--As for the brooch, and the story of theft and burglary, if any friend ever came to see me (which I defy you to prove, and deny,) he'd be just as much above doing such a thing as you yourself, <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00487" reg="nearbymention:Openshaw,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName>--and more so, too; for I am not at all sure as everything you have is rightly come by, or would be yours long, if every man had his own.&#x0022; She meant, of course, his wife, but he understood her to refer to his property in goods and chattels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/> &#x0026;Now, my good woman,&#x0026; said he, &#x0022;I'll just tell you truly, I never trusted you out and out; but my wife liked you, and I thought you had many a good point about you. If you once begin to sauce me, I'll have the police to you, and get out the truth in a court of justice, if you'll not tell it me quietly and civilly here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Now, the best thing you can do is quietly to tell me who the fellow is. Look here ! a man come to my house; asks for you; you take him up stairs; a valuable brooch is missing next day; we know that you, and <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, and cook, are honest; but you refuse to tell us who the man is. Indeed, you've told <num value="1">one</num> lie already about him, saying no <num value="1">one</num> was here last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Now I just put it to you, what do you think a policeman would say to this, or a magistrate ! A magistrate would soon make you tell the truth, my good woman.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/> &#x0022;There's never the creature born that should get it out of me,&#x0022; said Norah--&#x0022;not unless I choose to tell.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/> &#x0022;I've a great mind to see,&#x0022; said <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00488" reg="nearbymention:Openshaw,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName>, growing angry at the defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Then, checking himself, he thought before he spoke again: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> &#x0022;Norah, for your missus's sake I don't want to go to extremities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Be a sensible woman, if you can. It's no great disgrace, after all, to have been taken in. I ask you once more &mdash; as a friend &mdash; who was this man that you let into my house last night!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/> No answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>He repeated the question in an impatient tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Still no answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Norah's lips were set in determination not to speak. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> &#x0022;Then there is but <num value="1">one</num> thing to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>I shall send for a policeman.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> &#x0022;You will not,&#x0022; said Norah, starting forward. &#x0022;You shall not, sir. No policeman shall touch me. I know nothing of the brooch, but I know this: ever since I was <num value="4">four</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>, I have thought more of your wife than of myself; ever since I saw her, a poor motherless girl, put upon in her uncle's house, I have thought more of serving her than of serving myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>I have cared for her and her child as nobody ever cared for me. I don't cast blame on you, sir, but I say it's ill giving up <num value="1">one</num>'s life to any <num value="1">one</num>; for, at the end, they will turn round upon you and forsake you. Why does not my missus come herself to suspect me ! --<dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> be she's gone for the police?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>But I don't stay here either for police, or magistrate, or master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>You're an unlucky lot. I believe there's a curse on you. I'll leave you this very day. Yes, I'll leave that poor Ailsie, too. I will ! No good will ever come to you&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Before he could make up his mind what to say or what to do, Norah had left the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>I do not think he had ever really intended to send for the police to this old servant of his wife's, for he had never for a moment doubted her perfect honesty; but he had intended to compel her to tell him who the man was, and in this he was baffled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>He was, consequently, much irritated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>He returned to his uncle and aunt in a state of great annoyance and perplexity, and told them he could get nothing out of the woman; that some man had been in the house the night before, but that she refused to tell who he was. At this moment his wife came in, greatly agitated, and asked what had happened to Norah, for that she had put on her things in passionate haste, and left the house. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> &#x0022;This looks suspicious,&#x0022; said <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00490" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName>. &#x0022;It is not the way in which an honest person would have acted.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>He was sorely perplexed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>But <persName n="Openshaw,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00492" reg="nearbymention:Openshaw,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> turned round on <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00493" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> with a sudden fierceness no <num value="1">one</num> ever saw in her before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> &#x0022;You don't know Norah, uncle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>She is gone because she is deeply hurt at being suspected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Oh, I wish I had seen her, that I had spoken to her myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>She would have told me anything.&#x0022; <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> wrung her hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/> &#x0022;I must confess,&#x0022; continued <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00494" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> to his nephew, in a lower voice, &#x0022;I can't make you out. You used to be a word and a blow, and oftenest the blow <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; and now, when there is every cause for suspicion, you just do naught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Your missus is a very good woman, I grant, but she may have been put upon as well as other folk, I suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>If you don't send for the police, I shall.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/> &#x0022;Very well,&#x0022; replied <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00495" reg="nearbymention:Openshaw,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName>, surely; I can't clear Norah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>She won't clear herself, as I believe she might if she would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Only I wash my hands of it, for I am sure the woman herself is honest, and she lived a long time with my wife, and I don't like her to come to shame.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/> &#x0022;But she will then be forced to clear herself.
