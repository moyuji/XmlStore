<head>Increase of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals, stimulated by the novelty of a partial success in cavalry raids, are turning their attention from gunboats to horses, and are as delighted and demonstrative as children in possession of a new toy. The gunboats, which were once a terror, have fallen into almost equal contempt with friends and foes, and now the horses, with which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are much less familiar than with gunboats, are expected to take the place as an element of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> power of the defunct monstrosities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We are not disposed to underrate the potency of this last instrument of mischief; but to be forewarned is to be forearmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are always good enough to announce their amiable intentions to us in advance, as on the occasion of <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>'s raid, and they now say a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> cavalry will be added to their army in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. We may as well believe them, and prepare for the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>A comparatively small force of infantry, availing itself of the natural difficulties of the country, can keep back a large force of cavalry; but, for this purpose, the whole population of able bodied exempts should organize, and peremptory measures be everywhere adopted for any sudden emergency that may arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Our military leaders might be called on to furnish the details of a plan for the proper defence of the country against cavalry incursions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Wherever there are woods, or means of ditching and obstructing roads, it cannot be difficult to keep at bay <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> or horses; for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is never less at home than on that animal, and if, with the aid of only <num value="2">two</num> legs, he runs so fast that even our own cavalry can scarcely overtake him, what might he not be made to do with the aid of <num value="6">six</num>? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He ridiculed the proposition as preposterous, as utterly impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There was not such thing as keeping them &#x0022;cut in the cold&#x0022;--they could not be kept out. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, he said, were too inquisitive, too prying, too permeating, to be kept out from any place they wanted to go. They were the <hi rend="italics">pick locks</hi> among the nations, and no fastening was proof against them or could keep them out! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> This picture, drawn by a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> of his own people, is not only true, but <num value="1">one</num> of which they are rather proud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>From early times the most interesting traditions of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> households &mdash; the pleasant conversations &#x0022;to hum&#x0022;--are the reminiscences of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pedlars among the people of the <rs>South</rs>, showing how the poor, simple Southerners were robbed and swindled before their very eyes, and defrauded out of their money by the most patent cheats and fraudulent notions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They were delightful stories for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> change at the meeting house on the <name>Sabbath</name>, and elevated their narrators in the estimation of the elect and selectmen as very smart and promising young men, who would &#x0022;get along in the world.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It brings to mind a celebrated trial of skill at the <rs>World</rs>'s Fair in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> a few years since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A famous <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> mechanic unwittingly took him up. We forget his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He presented his lock in comparison with <persName n="Hobbs,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hobbs,nomatch:0"><surname>Hobbs</surname></persName>'s. How was the question of relative merit between the locks to be settled?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><persName n="Hobbs,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hobbs,nomatch:0"><surname>Hobbs</surname></persName> said &#x0022;easy enough.&#x0022;--&#x0022;I'll undertake to pick your lock and you undertake to pick mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If I pick yours, and you can't pick mine, of course mine is the best, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa.</hi>&#x0022; The <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> was green enough to accept the terms &mdash; he was not posted on <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cuteness and skill!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The result was inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman's</rs> lock was picked, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee's</rs> was not. But the <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> could not escape the consequence <rs>Hobbs</rs>'s lock triumphed, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> boasted immensely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Now, the truth was, no doubt, this: The <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman's</rs> lock was the best; but the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> was the best picker of locks!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The trial was a striking illustration of the fidelity of <persName n="Beecher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><surname>Beecher</surname></persName>'s portrait of his own race! </p> </div3>

<head>The elegant and Comfortable for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> envy.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> We gave some pictures of Southern homes from a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> letter writer in our paper of yesterday &mdash; of the homes that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are revelling in and desolating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The reader will remember that <num value="1">one</num> of the extracts spoke of &#x0022;the princely mansion of <persName n="James,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:James,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>James</surname></persName>, with its colonnades and cupola,&#x0022; visible from the place from which he wrote, on the bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Such a mansion could not long survive <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> envy and malignity when once in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We now learn that since the date of the letter from which we made the extracts that splendid private dwelling has been destroyed &mdash; reduced to a heap of ashes &mdash; by the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Worse than this, the generous owner and his wife have been taken prisoners and marched to the place of their inceration with manacles upon their arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>There they are confined in separate apartments, and no doubt treated with a brutality in keeping with the general conduct of the inhuman foe. What has reached the public eye concerning the losses and distresses, the ruin and woe visited by the invader upon the inhabitants of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> afford but a bird's-eye view of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They exceed any possible conception that may be formed of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They will alone fill a volume of the horrors which will be unfolded to an astonished world after the conclusion of this barbarous war. But there is a just retribution in store for the infernal race which has perpetrated them. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> should in this time of war &mdash; when so many are called from the field and workshop to the army &mdash; when the blockade has cut off supplies from abroad, and shut up our exportations to pay for them &mdash; when, in short, the demand for every necessary is increased and the supply greatly diminished &mdash; every <num value="1">one</num> should at such a time dispense with everything not indispensable, and endeavor, if possible, to supply himself with what he must have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The wardrobe, the larder, the house-furnishing, must all, come down to a war footing, and men must show by their self-denial and the cheerfulness with which they submit to deprivation, hardship &mdash; nay, suffering &mdash; how much they deserve the blessings of independence individual </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> We believe our people generally are giving these proofs of their merit in a manner honorable to the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>In some localities and some circles there is still a great bunkering after the fashion and show of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Fabulous prices are still paid for bonnets, when a little practice will enable any young lady to plait a bonnet in which the might appear as proud as a queen, and more lovely than she ever did before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is a time when plainness should be regarded a great virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Every dollar sent abroad for unnecessary things is so much taken from the ability to achieve the independence of the country in the pending struggle, which involves the happiness and very existence of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Fashionable communities &mdash; which are fortunately only local &mdash; should elevate themselves in all respects to the height of the crisis, and by their example inculcate the policy which is enjoined by every consideration of public duty and patriotism &mdash; the policy to buy nothing that is unnecessary, and nothing that we can make ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The iron fleet of this country, as it at present existed, was totally without that description of vessel which subdued the <rs>Indianola</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>There might be some ground for this in the case of wooden ships, for Government never had recourse to building in private yards till their own stock of seasoned timber was exhausted, and no private builder could compete with the <rs>Government</rs> in the amount of stock.
