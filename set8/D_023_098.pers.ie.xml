<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> No <num value="1">one</num> would have fancied, for an instant, that the eyes peering so gloomily in the glowing mass in the grate were wearing their natural expression, or that the curves at the corners of the rose bud mouth usually bore so perseveringly downward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><num value="1">One</num> might not have considered a flash of anger or an old fashioned pout so unreasonable remembering the many grievances of pretty women, but the distrust buried in among the long, silken bashes, and the quiver on the lips, were evidences of a trouble whose roots grew very deep into the heart, and formed a singular contrast to the luxurious surroundings of the occupant of the easy chair by the fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> At all events, it was a comfortable place in which to indulge sorrow or discontent, this crimson cushioned <unclear><hi rend="italics">fauteuil,</hi></unclear> with wide, loving arms, which held so daintily the petite form arrayed in the most becoming of white cashmere dressing robes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>And the robe not hastily thrown on for a make-believe <hi rend="italics">toilette,</hi> either, for, at the opening, where the rose-colored linings relieved the dead white of the cambric, glimpses of a delicate embroidery were seen, and where the black satin slipper was elevated to reach the zephyr worked footstool, rich masses of <hi rend="italics">applique,</hi> fresh from the hands of the <hi rend="italics"><unclear></unclear></hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> There was none of the carelessness of grief by outward forms, either, in the arrangement of this little <hi rend="italics"><unclear>boud </unclear></hi> for, the rosewood stand <unclear></unclear> her elbow, on which lay the pearl inlaid work-box and gilded books in blue and scarlet bindings; the velvet carpet, gay as white and crimson roses could make it, the heavy curtains that shut out the glare of a New Orleans run and deadened the harsh sounds from the busy streets, the cabinet piano, open and strewn with music, the mirrors and pictures; and the glad coal fire, flashing from wall to ceiling, brightening the pictures, dashing over the mirrors, dancing on the golden frames, sinking into the curtains, and ever and anon peeping into the eyes that the long lashes were trying to hide from it, made up as consoling a prospect for a <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> day as <num value="1">one</num> could desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But these little <hi rend="italics">agreements,</hi> which would have made the room so enchanting to a heart at rest, and whose arrangements, a short time before, must have been presided over by a loving hand, would seem to have lost their charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <name>English</name> coal in the grate crackled, and sparkled, and spluttered, and sung; and the bright blaze sunk quietly down as if spell-bound by the eyes, and then, with a sudden rush, started anew in its search after secrets in the dark corners, and up the rich silken folds of the curtains, and through the long lashes, into the blue eyes, over which the black brows were growing every instant more stormy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>And still the lady eat and pondered, and gloomed over some grief whose teeth were very close on to her heartstrings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> She had visitors that morning, for the chairs were standing awry round the rug, and a stray parasol lay on the <hi rend="italics">console,</hi> forgotten by the hand that laid it there to smooth a curler adjust a braid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If a visitor had heart to inspect the face of the <num value="1">one</num>, or improve the set of the other after the morning's conversation, it was more than her luckless hostess could have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But we will avail ourselves of a privilege conceded to no other human being, over this particular spot of earth, and <q>&#x0022;roll back the wheels of time&#x0022;</q> to the precise epoch when <num value="3">three</num> ladies sat so cozily by the aforementioned fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> <q>&#x0022;Yes,&#x0022;</q> said a bright-haired damsel, to the dark-browed of the <hi rend="italics">fauteuil,</hi> in continuation of some astounding intelligence, <q>&#x0022;they say she is as beautiful as a lover's dream, and though he is so perfectly devoted, he has never once been seen in public with her.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> <q>&#x0022;I do not consider <hi rend="italics">that</hi> so very mysterious,&#x0022;</q> returned the lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><q>&#x0022;A <num value="1000">thousand</num> trifling causes may prevent, but I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> think it strange the gentleman should be named <persName n="Lyle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><surname>Lyle</surname></persName>, and a lawyer on <address><street n="Camp street">Camp street</street></address>, for I know of no <persName n="Lyle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><surname>Lyle</surname></persName> there but <hi rend="italics">my</hi> husband.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> <q>&#x0022;I do not think either strange,&#x0022;</q> said the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> lady of the party, a plain, straightforward, practical-looking person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><q>&#x0022;If <num value="1">one</num> is so disposed, the veriest trifle may be converted into matter for suspicion or mystery.--It is an every-day occurrence, which <persName n="Julia,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Julia,nomatch:0"><surname>Julia</surname></persName>, with her large organs of marvelousness and credulity, is weaving into a most mystical web for somebody's discomfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The only reliable part of the story is, that an old tumble-down <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> has been vacant for some time, and finally the bill <q>&#x0022;for rent&#x0022; </q> is removed from the door, and the carpenters and painters put it in habitable condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Then, some very handsome furniture finds its way in, and a nice-looking old lady and a beautiful girl follow; soon a handsome young man, very <hi rend="italics">distingue,</hi> calls on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Being strangers in the city, perhaps, he is their only visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But now, the mystery begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The neighbors opposite remark that it is at the same hour every morning that the gentleman calls; but he never, by any accident, is seen on the street with her.--This excites their speculation and inquiry, and they ascertain his name to be <persName n="Lyle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><surname>Lyle</surname></persName>, and that he is a lawyer on <address><street n="Camp street">Camp street</street></address>; and it comes to <placeName reg="Union, Stewart, Georgia" key="tgn,2024572">Julia</placeName>'s ears, who is wrap in astonishment that there should be <num value="2">two</num> <persName n="Lyles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lyles,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyles</surname></persName>, both lawyers, with offices on the same street, and she cannot rest until she comes to inflict her bewilderment on you. For my part I do not believe the man's name is <persName n="Lyle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><surname>Lyle</surname></persName>, or that he is a lawyer, or lives on <address><street n="Camp street">Camp street</street></address>, or that there is a man in the case. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <q>&#x0022;I do not see how you can say that,&#x0022;</q> replied the other, <q>&#x0022;when you, yourself, heard <persName n="Weldon,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Weldon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Weldon</surname></persName>, who lives just opposite, say that he called every morning at <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> and remained till <num value="1">one</num>, and that on <name>Sunday</name> he only stopped a few minutes, and the young lady went to church alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>You know <persName n="Weldon,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Weldon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Weldon</surname></persName> described his appearance, and even the color of his cost, which I cannot now remember; but <persName><foreName>Matilda</foreName></persName> affects to set herself so high above gossip that she has fallen into a state of perfect skepticism, and is so much afraid she may be accused of believing the moon is made of green cheese, she has actually got to thinking there is no moon at sit.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> <q>&#x0022;This proves, then,&#x0022;</q> said <persName><foreName>Matilda</foreName></persName>, who noticed the shadow growing deeper on the brow of her hostess, and half guessed the cause, <q>&#x0022;that I am not lunatic enough to believe the stories hatched by the crazy imaginations of moon-worshippers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I let the <unclear> </unclear> shine in on <unclear></unclear> reason, and try to <unclear></unclear> they are.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Poor <persName><foreName>Adele</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In a most uncomfortable frame of mind did her <num value="2">two</num> visitors leave her. The plain common sense of the <num value="1">one</num> being powerless to undo the mischief created by the gossiping imagination of the other, who never dreamed how deeply the poisoned arrows had struck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At length a bright idea comes to her &mdash; how easy the solution of this mystery!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Is there yet time?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The slender minute-hand of the little boudoir clock on the mantel pointed to the half hour after <time value="12pm">noon</time>. She would yet be early enough to reach his office and confront him on his arrival from his clandestine visit to the hidden beauty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> As fast as her trembling hands permitted, was the robe do chambre changed for the plain but elegantly-fitting silk, which pretty little <persName n="Lyle,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName> clasped round her pretty little form, hiding both carefully within the folds of a long, black cloak; and gathered, gloved, and bonneted, and closely veiled, eschewing city cars, for the excitement of her mind spurned the quiet, easy motion over the rails, she flow rather than walked down &mdash; street, into Prytania, until she arrived at No.--Camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The office boy was gaping at the door, and the solitary clerk was at his work at the desk.--<persName n="Lyle,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName> was not there. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But there was no call on him. The dark brows lowered over the eyes, and the lips were clamped, as if by the sudden clasping of a spring lock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>She buried herself, hoops, cloak, and all, in the great, faded, red morocco chair, and resumed the old employment of trying to read her fate in the blazing coals. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The clerk cleared his throat, settled himself more squarely in his chair, and was at a loss to know whether etiquette required him to copy the example of his visitor, or go on with his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He was ready for either, but not being able to make up his mind he steered a middle course, re- arranged each separate article on his desk, and stirred the fire; and then gazed earnestly up and down the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The seconds grew into minutes, then the loud tones of the city clock struck <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The little jewelled <placeName reg="Geneva, Ontario, New York" key="tgn,2069365">Geneva</placeName>, at the lady's side, was drawn forth for a comparison, and silently replaced; and she sunk again into the motionless quiet which <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Jones,B.,,,:1"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, being a married man and secretly poetical, likened in his own mind to the moment's pause that nature takes to summon her whole strength for the storm.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> But <persName n="Lyle,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName> brushed past him, unheeding the respectful bow unconsciously given in deprecation of the anger he saw but could not understand; and the fluttering of her ribbons disappeared round the corner of the street. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>She was his employer's wife, and he had a wife--<num value="2">two</num> potent reasons for being silent.--And the way she dashed out of the office set him to thinking it wasn't Conrey after all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The sleek, soft, gentle motion of the cars would have added to the torture she was enduring; but the tearing-apart of-soul-and-body jolting of the omnibus just suited her. It seemed the outward manifestation of the demon, whose indwelling was riddling her heart-strings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> It was a most imprudent step, this, making herself so conspicuous by calling on a stranger with inquiries about her own husband, and showing her mistrust and suspicious to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The parlor blinds were open, as it was on the shady side of the street, and the white, linen shades lowered, as was usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The little yard in front was newly dug and planted with roses and evergreens, and the palings were fresh and white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>There seemed nothing to be gleaned from an outside survey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>She rang the bell, and asked for <persName n="Weldon,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Weldon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Weldon</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> A prettier being could scarcely be found in New Orleans than the little lady who lightly laid her white-gloved hand in young Conrey's as she stepped into the carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Her brow was as smooth as if no Etna raged within her bosom, and the rose-bud lips showed no canker at the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>How gaily she chattered as the carriage rolled over the stones, and how she discoursed learnedly about the war, and States rights policy, and battle-fields, and wondered what news the next dispatches would bring; and never a word to say her heart was breaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>When the carriage stopped, and she looked out, she &mdash; what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>She brushed her eyes as if the long lashes had thrown a glamor over them &mdash; and then she looked across the way. Then she peered closely at the white palings, the freshly planted yard, the white linen shades at the windows, and then took an inquisitive survey of the gentleman beside her. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>I did not go to church with her, because I had promised <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Jones,B.,,,:1"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> to do some copying for him while he went out with his wife; and if I have not been on the street with her, it has been purely accidental, and because, I suppose, it was pleasanter to sit with her in the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>But, in the name of all that is curious, how <hi rend="italics">did you</hi> become aware of this?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> <q>&#x0022;Never mind &mdash; it doesn't matter,&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Lyle,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Nor did it. This was <hi rend="italics">the other side of the story,</hi> which had flashed through her mind as soon as she recognized the <hi rend="italics">locale.</hi> What a dance she felt herself to be, not to have understood it all before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>And, smiling and graceful, she sprang from the carriage, while Conrey followed, exceedingly puzzled at the singular interrogatories to which he had been subjected, and among all the queer things he had known a woman do, thinking this the queerest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>But he opened the gate and handed her up the steps to the little porch, where the door was instantly opened, showing they were surely expected, and where the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glance showed them a beautiful girl with her work basket, and an elderly lady with her knitting, seated in a copy, home-like way, round a cheerful fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>It is not necessary to explain for what use this <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> knitting work was designed, <date value="1862-01">this January, 1862.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> Nothing every seen inside these walls before could exceed the suavity of the lovely visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>So fascinating was she that the fair <rs>Emma</rs> had scarcely time to notice the mysterious wonderment that stole at intervals over the face of her betrothed, and how he watched that of his beautiful companion, as if he expected to find there the solution of a problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>But nothing was to be seen, only the brightest of eyes and rosiest of smiles, and the face clear in daylight. </p>

She would not dare to meet her husband, who had gone off feeling wretchedly about her indisposition unless she carried home so fair an excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Good <persName n="Crawford,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Crawford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName>, who thought her coming out very imprudent, when her husband fancied her sick in bed, concluded it might be as well to give him something else to think of and consented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/><persName n="Lyle,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName> had a double motive in wishing for company that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>She had not made up her mind what explanation to give Conrey in regard to the questions, and therefore didn't care about being alone with him and never having been able to keep a secret, she was afraid, unless she had a safety valve for her excitement until she could quiet down, her husband might find out <hi rend="italics">that other side</hi> of the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>She was a sensible woman, knew human nature by instinct, and had always thought as good a way as any other to keep her husband straight, was never to let him suspect it could possibly enter her head he could go wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>She never reminded him that other women were as beautiful as herself, by being jealous of them, and no matter what twinges she may occasionally have felt, she let them wear themselves out in silence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> When they reached C &mdash; street the gas was lighted, and the evening was already in; and when the carriage reached the door, her husband was on the steps, waiting for her. She could see by the faint light that his face wore an anxious expression; but it faded directly when she met him, with eyes and cheeks as bright and fresh as health and a cool <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> wind could make them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>He had been afraid she might bring on a worse attack of toothache, and thought she was running unnecessary risk, thus exposing herself to oblige young Conrey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>But he saw in a moment the visit had done her good, and was prepared to make the acquaintance of his student's friends with the most hospitable feelings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> How charming <persName n="Lyle,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName> made herself and her boudoir to her visitors that evening &mdash; and how gracefully she presided at the <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> tea. <q>&#x0022;Something substantial,&#x0022;</q> her husband asked for, <q>&#x0022;to make up for a slim dinner,&#x0022;</q> and the broiled oysters, cold duck, light cakes, and hot coffee, were unexceptionable &mdash; so was the music after supper &mdash; the wit and repartee. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> The fair <rs>Emma</rs> smiled, and blushed, and listened, and thought surely nothing so fascinating was ever seen as the beautiful <persName n="Lyle,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Conrey always knew she was charming, but somehow it would come across his mind how she had looked at him in the office that day. <persName n="Crawford,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Crawford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName> worked and listened, dreamy and contented, and gave all the attention possible from the sock she had on hand; though at intervals, as she musingly measured the heel on her fore finger, her fancy would wander off to the young soldier to whose lot that sock would fall, and whose mother might never see her boy again; and the tear that dimmed her eye was half in sympathy with the unknown mother and half in thank fulness to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, as she looked at her smiling daughter, that such great agony had been spared her.--She had no son to pour out his young life on the battle- field. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>And when the latter were left alone, <persName n="Lyle,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="nearbymention:Lyle,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyle</surname></persName>, in the exuberance of his satisfaction, took his little wife in his arms and kissed her to his heart's content, declaring, between each kiss, that he certainly was the happiest fellow on earth; and never to his dying day, I hope, will he know how near he was, that same night, to being the most miserable. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The following is the article from the <hi rend="italics">Herald:</hi> </p> <cit><q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> In yesterday's <hi rend="italics">Tribune,</hi> over his own proper signature, <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> published a letter to which he declares is favor of the right of secession, no only in the easy of the rebellions States of the <rs>South</rs>, but even of the <rs>Pacific States</rs> and <rs>Territories</rs>, should they desire to set up a new Government for themselves He <unclear></unclear> down this <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs>, applicable to every State in the <name>Unions</name><q>&#x0022;<unclear></unclear> I have taught and believed, and still maintain, is the right of a people to form and modify their political institutions without the necessity of fighting for such change.&#x0022;</q> He denies that a county, or <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> counties, can lawfully secede from a State.--For example, the people of <placeName reg="Nantucket Island, Nantucket, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1008293">Nantucket</placeName> could not be permitted to secede from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, nor the people of <placeName key="tgn,7015824" n="1.000 2" reg="long island city, queens, new york">Long Island</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7022656" n="1.000 86" reg="staten island, new york, kings">Staten Island</placeName> from the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But the case is different with a sovereign State, or even a colony which is not sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>For example, he says, <cit><q rend="inline"> &#x0022;I believe our revolutionary fathers had a right, for reasons which were cogent and seamed to them conclusive, to terminate their connection with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and that the <rs>British</rs> were wrong in roasting their claim to do so. And the right which I claim for our fathers and for ourselves I will not deny to others.&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl></cit> </p> </q><bibl n="Herald"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> Then he goes on to say that <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;if the people of our Pacific States and Territories shall at some future time have very generally attained the conviction that they could do better as an independent nation than as a part of this country, and should kindly, frankly, firmly express that conviction,&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl></cit> he would say let the bonds be dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>And so like wise in the case of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The following are his words: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> &#x0022;This is the doctrine I tried to promulgate in the winter of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">61</year></dateStruct>--it seems with ill success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>But I still insist that if it had been proved that the people of the slave States--or even of the cotton States alone &mdash; had really desired to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>, and had peacefully, deliberately and authoritatively expressed that wish, we should have assented to it. At all events, I should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>But they chose another method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The leaders assumed their right peacefully and summarily to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs> without the consent of their fellow citizens &mdash; at least their close allies, their equal copartners of the free States.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> It is said that an honest confession is good for the soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/><persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> had owned up at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Many a time we charged him with promulgating these doctrines and quoted extracts from his journal in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>He either denied the soft impeachment or was dumb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Now, after contributing in so vast a degree to break up the <rs>Union</rs>, he expects forgiveness for his treason, like the penitent thief on the cross; but his repentance is not sincere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Let him, therefore, like <persName n="Judas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Judas,nomatch:0"><surname>Judas</surname></persName>-<unclear> iscariot</unclear> go and hang himself <q>&#x0022;on a sour apple-tree,&#x0022;</q> so as to save the people the trouble of doing it hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>If the right of a State peacefully to secede exists, the accident of war cannot alter the right; and if the cotton States had a right to secede on the ground that they had <q>&#x0022;very generally attained the conviction that they could do better as an independent nation than as a part of this country,&#x0022;</q> then we had no right to prevent their doing so by force, and were the aggressors in making war upon them, whereas, in taking up arms they were only defending a sacred right.--Even in the case of seizing the forts and other property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, they were only seizing a part of the common property, to which they had as good a right as the free States, <q>&#x0022;their equal copartners.&#x0022;</q> If this was all that was the matter, the account could have been easily settled and war would not have been necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>In fact, the war, according to the reasoning of <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, it on our part the most atrocious ever waged against any people, and even more unjustifiable than that which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> waged against these States when they were colonies under her sovereign away and threw off her yoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>There can be no doubt that the people of the <name>States</name> which have seceded are more unanimous than were the colonies at any time during the revolutionary war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> <sic>is</sic> is very evident that <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is of the same opinion now that he was in the winter of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">61</year></dateStruct>; that the <rs>Union</rs> is not an indissoluble Government, but a rope of sand; that it may at any time be broken up like a partnership, and that he is in favor of the dissolution if the <rs>South</rs> really wants to go. This appears more clearly from an editorial article in yesterday's <hi rend="italics">Tribune,</hi> headed <q>&#x0022;inklings of Peace,&#x0022;</q> in which he says, <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;There must be an accommodation, (between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>) and, that fact established, it seems to us very easy to settle the terms.&#x0022; </q><bibl> </bibl></cit> So, then, all the blood that has been shed, and all the money that has been expended, and all the sorrow and calamity that have befallen the country, are in vain, and <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is willing to let the <rs>South</rs> go, even without the emancipation of a single negro.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> And here, at the outset, I desire to express my emphatic and unqualified condemnation of that and all similar meetings, whatever may be their ostensible or real objects, as unwarrantable assemblages, tending to disorganization and mischief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> It has been represented that this was a most patriotic gathering, for the purpose of consultation respecting the best mode of aiding the <rs>Government</rs> in carrying on the war. Grant it for a moment, for the sake of the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The Constitution recognizes no necessity for such assemblages and consultations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>On the contrary, the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> forbids a State to enter into any agreement or compact with another State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Now, if an agreement of <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governors</rs> of States, respecting what each will do as <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of his State in certain cases, or in relation to any proposed action, is not strictly and technically an agreement of the <name>States</name> which they represent, it is substantially of the same character, and tends to the same mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>If it does not bind the <rs>State</rs>, it will control the action of the party who made it, as Governor, representing his State; and it will be carried into effect by him, as Governor, as if it were an agreement or compact of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> If Governors may meet and combine for <num value="1">one</num> purpose, they may for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>If they may agree, as Governors, to support the <name>Administration</name> of the <rs>National Government</rs>, they may as readily agree, as Governors, that they will oppose it. And thus we have a precedent by which <q>&#x0022;loyal Governors&#x0022;</q> may combine to control the action of the constituted head of the nation, and reduce the <rs>President</rs> to the necessity of administering the <rs>Government</rs> according to their loyal ideas and policy, instead of his own convictions of his constitutional duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> If I had time, I should be pleased to follow out an exposition of the evil consequences which may attach themselves to such a precedent, even if the precedent had none but the best Intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But let us inquire whether this meeting of the <rs>Governors</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7015966" n="1.000 12" reg="altoona, blair, pennsylvania">Altoona</placeName> is entitled to the very harmless and patriotic character which has been claimed for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> If, instead of a meeting to aid the <rs>President</rs> in such measures as he, the constitutional commander in-chief, should deem advisable in order to carry on the war and suppress the rebellion, it shall appear that the design, purpose and effect of it, was to control his action; compel him to adopt their policy in the prosecution of the war; to select a military commander of their choice, and to issue such proclamation or proclamations as they should dictate &mdash; if all or any of these things were the object of that assemblage, then the vocabulary may be remarked to find fitting terms of reprobation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> Great surprise was manifested upon the receipt of the proclamation, because it was so perfectly manifest that it was ineffective for the purpose for which it was apparently issued, and was so capable of being made an instrument of mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>That surprise was not lessened, but was increased tenfold, when it was found that but little more then a week before it was issued the <rs>President</rs> himself not only understood that a proclamation of emancipation was ineffective for the purposes of the war, but that he had the gravest doubts of his authority to issue each a <unclear></unclear> and <unclear></unclear> at the same time, that there was a great <unclear> </unclear> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Everything indicates a design on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to capture the remainder of our seaboard cities, If they can, during the winter, and thus to cut us off still farther than the blockade has done from all intercourse with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and to secure on all sides gates by which they can pour their troops into the interior of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Should they succeed, it will not advance them a single stop on the road to subjugation for before we can be conquered the whole interior must be subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>They have New Orleans and almost the entire navigation of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, and yet they have not advanced <num value="1">one</num> step in their favorite project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>They remember that not for that did the patriots of that day despair, but that on the contrary they gathered fresh strength from every defeat until, at last, they conquered their inheritance from the strong grasp of the <unclear>spoilen.</unclear> They-know that the men of this day are no way inferior to the men of that &mdash; if they are to be judged by their sections, they are, in deed, greatly superior, and they take courage accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Nevertheless, it is not to be supposed that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will obtain possession of these seaports without a desperate struggle &mdash; We expect it, and we are prepared for it.--The example of New Orleans will never be imitated during this war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>He has played his last card.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>He has declared by a proclamation that in all the <name>States</name> that shall not have returned to the <rs>Union</rs> on the <date value="01-01">1st of January,</date> the slaves shall after that date be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>When the <rs>Union</rs> existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>its Constitution gave no right, either to the <rs>President</rs> alone or to the <rs>President</rs> and Congress combined, to abolish slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The Abolitionists assume that the war has conferred the right; emancipation was a <q> &#x0022;thunderbolt placed in the hands&#x0022;</q> of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00303" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, with which to destroy the <rs>South</rs> and all its social organizations at a blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>He has accepted the assumed right, and launched the thunderbolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>But he is without the power to enforce the decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The <rs>North</rs> must conquer every square mile of the <rs>Southern States</rs> before it can make the proclamation more than waste paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The policy that has dictated the proclamation is very doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Nothing was needed to deepen the hatred of the <rs>South</rs>, but if anything could determine it to continue the war to the last extremity it is this decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> already denounce it as unconstitutional; the moderate <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> condemn it as a measure that can have no practical result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>It will have no effect on the <rs>South</rs>, which has long acted as against an Abolitionist Government of the <rs>North</rs> and anticipated all it can do by any kind of legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>In the <rs>North</rs> itself it is likely to be only another element of confusion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>As the <rs>South</rs> shows no inability to continue the war, the offer is reasonable and temperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The statesman should stand behind the soldier, or war itself is a miserable and purposeless blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>The Northern Government also contemplates peace, but in a most singular manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Exactly when its military and political powers are most broken, it threatens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>It continues to refuse all recognition of existing facts, and clings to constitutional and legal fictions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/> It insists that the storm of war has swept away nothing, and offers, on certain conditions, to ignore the war itself.
