<head>&#x0022;Promotions for Merit.&#x0022;</head> <opener> <salute>To the <name>Editors</name> of the <name>Dispatch</name>.</salute> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> In your paper of the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th inst.</day></dateStruct>, you have an article headed <q>&#x0022;Promotions for Merit, &#x0022;</q> upon which I would like to make some remarks: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Your remark in that article, that military schools do not make great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, is literally true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>For a man to be a great General, <num value="2">two</num> conditions are requisite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, that he should be a man of great natural ability and, secondly, that he should possess that knowledge of military matters which will render his abilities available to the army.--Now, though <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> cannot give him the natural ability, it can furnish him with the requisite knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It also gives him some habits which are of use to him in commanding an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Now, though the military knowledge is necessary, there are <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> in which a man who has not been to military schools may make a great General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, he may have been in the army from early youth, and by that means, and perhaps by such study as he could give, may have <q>&#x0022;picked up&#x0022;</q> the knowledge which is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Secondly, he may be a man of such transcendent talents that he shall possess most of the learning by intuition, and shall acquire the rest while actively employed.--The latter case, it may safety be stated, is exceedingly rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I do not believe myself that it ever occurs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> There are some cases which appear at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight to be the last case named, but which in reality are not so. I will try and explain this mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The reason that learning is necessary for a General in this age is, that a great many scientific means and mode of warfare exist, and, as they are of advantage where they are employed by <num value="1">one</num> side, they must be employed by the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But if the forces on each side consist of but a few men, and those simply armed, it requires little beyond natural astuteness to command them.--On this account, some men appointed directly from civil life to command armies have distinguished themselves; because their duties were simple, and they were not called upon to employ any science in their warfare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> But, suppose the commander having in charge the force alluded to above, and who is an inexperienced person, to be suddenly called upon with his infantry to hold a fortification mounting heavy ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>What is he to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>If he should even be able to find out for himself how to work his guns, how long would it be before he reached sufficient perfection to be able to teach his men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>A case of this very kind occurred at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>There were several officers there is command who bad not been at the military schools of which some persons have such a horror.--Not knowing how to work the heavy guns in the forts, of course they did not drill their men at it, though they were there for a considerable time before the enemy came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>When he did come, they were so unskillful that at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire they made, their largest gun and <num value="2">two</num> others were dismounted by themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I believe that they disabled some others soon afterwards, and the shots from those that they did continue to fire passed in most cases over the vessels of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>If they had been commanded by officers from the much-abused military or the <orgName n="Naval School" type="school">naval school</orgName>, they would probably have sunk the enemy's vessels, for his fire was not so very destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>A naval officer was sent down to instruct them, but he was removed so soon after being sent there that he could teach them but little. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> It is often asked, in this connection, &#x0022;Did C&#x00E6;sar or <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> over attend a military school?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>No; but in those times the means of warfare were very simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>War was an art, not a science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The same appears more clearly in the case of naval warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The science, or rather art, (as it then was,) or war was so simple that men who had, perhaps, never before been to sea took command of fleets and fought them successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Such was the case in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> up to about the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> century; but about that time the art of navigation began to improve, and also the means of offence possessed by vessels, and consequently the art of naval warfare became more complicated, and we find about that time that naval commanders that were especially such began to be employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>And now a days woe be to the fleet or vessel which should engage the enemy of start on a cruise with a landsman in command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> As to the list of <persName n="Generals,,French,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Generals,French,,,"><foreName>French</foreName> <surname>Generals</surname></persName> which you published the other day, it must be remembered that they were not doctors, lawyers, and politicians, appointed suddenly to a military command; but men who had, most of them, been in the army from their youth, and in a considerable number of yours had enjoyed an opportunity of a quantities <unclear></unclear> experience most of that knowledge which a military school would have given them mote readily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It may be mentioned, that the ablest of them all, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, does not appear to have had his military ability much injured by the military school in which he was educated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It may also be remarked in reference to these <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, that many of them were remarkable not for their ability in conducting a campaign themselves, but as excellent men to carry out the orders of their chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>As to the fact that these men came from the ranks of the army, it may be remarked that a great many of them were chosen by the genius of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> who had a great talent for picking out men who could serve his purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>I fear that like success might not attend a similar effort by <persName n="Benjamin,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Benjamin,J.,P.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>In conclusion, if the school of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> can produce no great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, how many can the school of politics produce &mdash; the only school which, if <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> is neglected, is likely to furnish them? </p> <closer> <signed><orgName n="Common Sense" type="newspaper">Common Sense</orgName>.</signed> </closer> </div3>
