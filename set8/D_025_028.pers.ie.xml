<head>Recognition</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The English Government is still waiting for a more &#x0022;convenient season&#x0022; for recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>There is no Government in the world which observes so great a degree of reticence in its diplomacy as the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Nor is there <num value="1">one</num> in which the people and the <rs>Legislative Department</rs> defer more entirely to the <name>Ministry</name> on all questions touching the foreign relations of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is quite sufficient to a member of Parliament who moves a resolution or submits an inquiry to be informed by a member of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> that the resolution would embarrass the <rs>Government</rs>, or the inquiry could not be answered with a due regard to the public interest, to induce the withdrawal of the resolution and abandonment of the inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>So we see that <persName n="Roebuck,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Roebuck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roebuck</surname></persName>--although a somewhat impracticable person, and although he had introduced his resolution very earnestly and ardently &mdash; yields as passively as a bee that is sprinkled with water, and is hived along with his resolution by the <rs>Ministry According</rs> to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, &#x0022;<name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government do not see that the opportunity has arisen&#x0022; &#x0022;for advising the re-establishment of peace in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> !&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The discussion of this subject is with the <rs>Foreign Powers</rs>, the <rs>Confederates</rs> are not pressing it. It might have died months ago for us. We may look on and or criticise what falls from <rs type="role" reg="Minister">Ministers</rs> of State about us with no small amount of composure, since we ask nothing and expect very little if anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We know who our fast friend is in the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> diplomacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>That man is <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He is as much the friend of justice, however, as he is of us, in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is not probable that his inclination or his interests will permit of long delay in recognizing the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>England we should think would be forced to concur, but this may be a mistaken idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>She may not be satisfied with the amount of blood that has been shed &mdash; she may not think the heroism and constancy displayed by our people entitle us to her recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But whatever she thinks the course of events cannot be stayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>As a nation has been made against her whole military power, <num value="1">one</num> may at least be made without her recognition ! </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>&#x0022;Hope from Outside.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> is but just in its remark, in its leader yesterday, on this subject, that this paper does not intend to &#x0022;recommend any relaxation of our own exertions at home&#x0022; in this war on account of &#x0022;hope from outside.&#x0022; The article in this paper, which the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> in part makes a text for its own, stated certain grounds for the belief that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> would never allow the restoration of the old <name>North</name> <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The idea is quite rational, and its entertainers are complacent enough to think it irresistible to the great powers themselves!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But it may be entertained without abating our own exertions in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In this war we can only safely depend upon ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This paper has, indeed, represented the exigency of final dependence upon foreign aid as only less painful and humiliating than submission to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> rule &mdash; to which last give us anything in preference, and from which <unclear>Gd,</unclear> in his Infinite mercy, protect us ! We concur entirely in the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer's</hi> view, therefore, of that strait which would throw us upon the helping hand of foreign nations as <num value="1">one</num> low in itself, and in which, possibly, we should have to pay a very dear price. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> It is needless to say that thus far we have proven that we were independent of foreign aid, and since there was no present occasion for it, and none in prospect, we see no reason against the proposition in the fact that no such aid has been offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If there is <num value="1">one</num> sentiment unanimously entertained by the people of the <rs>South</rs>, we believe it to be this: That we can have no certain and complete independence-- no independence without drawback, and which places us equal among the nations unless we achieve it by our own manhood and constancy, our bravery and prowess in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On this point the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> and we are always agreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>About the other it is matter of little importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We trust and believe that it will never be tested. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Our nation should, indeed, hope for nothing from the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> save recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>That has been so long delayed that all hope has nearly died out, and it may be all the better that it has. But the <rs>Confederate</rs> public can at least stand unaffected by a little speculation touching a remote and improbable contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>No man's hand will relax, we trust, because it is said that in the last extremity foreign powers would interfere to ensure the separation of the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs>North</rs>; or that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> had decreed the disruption and spitting in pieces of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>That &#x0022;last extremity&#x0022; we should fight harder to avoid than anything short of subjugation to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and we should remember that we are but the <hi rend="italics">instruments to work out this just decree</hi> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Having disposed of the army, he could then march wherever and whenever it suited him. The question then recurs, whether the distribution of his troops at different and distant points was not unfortunate, in this that it required more time to concentrate them when the time of battle had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It was a singular dispersion of his forces, after much hard fighting and marching, that prevented him from beating <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>His object then was the capture of the garrison at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, in which he was successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>In the present instance it was his desire, doubtless, to place his army at convenient points for procuring subsistence, secure his flanks against attack by cutting such railway lines as might be used against him, and to draw the enemy as far into the interior of the country as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>But let us proceed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> Were we compelled to accept battle at the time and place we did?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> But the battle was joined at the time and place selected by the <rs>Federal</rs> commander.--The place, strong by nature, was rendered still more formidable by a number of stone fences which crossed the field, by the open ground we had to move over to reach it and by field works thrown up by the enemy during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The attack was renewed by ourselves on the evening of the <num value="21">21</num>, without proper <unclear>re</unclear>, and not simultaneously along the whole line, but irregularly and spasmodically, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> or division, and then by another, reminding <num value="1">one</num> of a team of ill matched horses, which, refusing to pull together, are unable to move the load which a simultaneous and common effort might certainly accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The troops never fought better or inflicted greater loss upon the enemy; and strong as the position of the latter was, they surely would have carried it, though at a heavy loss, if the attack had been differently planned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>As it was they pushed the enemy back, ran over numberless batteries which they were unable to bring off, captured many flags, and killed and wounded more men than in any previous battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Indeed, the more successful our assaults were up to a certain point, the greater was our loss; for the further an attacking column drove the enemy, not being supported by a combined attack, the more fearfully were its flanks raked by the oblique and enfilading free of the batteries which were not assaulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The <unclear></unclear> was executed in gallant style, and some of the batteries on the hill were carried; but his success was temporary, though purchased at a fearful cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The want of proper support, the movement of the enemy upon his exposed and bleeding flanks, and the terrible cross and obliques fires concentrated upon him from batteries not otherwise occupied, made it necessary for him to retrace his steps across the open ground over which he had advanced, his ranks torn and bleeding, and still suffering from the iron hail of shell, grape, canister, and shrapnel, that swept over the field.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The repeated assaults made by Confederates, therefore, though made with the greatest valor, and successful up to a certain point, failed to dislodge the enemy from his strong position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>It is but simple justice to add that in no single instance that now occurs to me did our troops retire except under orders; nor did the enemy ever make the least attempt at pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>In no sense of the word were they beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>All that can be justly claimed by the enemy is that he maintained his ground against our assaults, though at a fearful cost of life and limb.
