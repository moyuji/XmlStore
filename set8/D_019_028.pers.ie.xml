<head>Early apprehensions of dissolution.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> The fathers of the <rs>Republic</rs> seemed to have had a very plain perception of the probable disruption of the <rs>Union</rs> by reason of its magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It has been a favorite theory of our later times, that wide extension and great diversity of interests tended to strengthen rather than weaken the federal bond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>This would undoubtedly have been the effect in fact, but for the persistent efforts of Northern agitators to place the <rs>Southern</rs> section under the law of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>A long, systematic effort has been made to degrade <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the <rs>Union</rs> in the eyes of the other, and of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The spirit of mutual hatred and animosity has been planted in the hearts of the <num value="2">two</num> sections, and we have at length realized all the fears of the founders of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>However strong and compact the <rs>Union</rs> might have been rendered by expansion, if fraternal sentiments had continued to pervade the people, it is plain that expansion has hastened and ensured the dissolution of a divided and alienated Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The necessity of union for self-protection which originally consolidated the <name>Colonies</name> and the infant States together, has passed away; each section of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is strong enough to defend itself against a world in arms; hatred and hostility have rendered association odious, and dissolution results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> From a painful and ever-present fear of dissolution, from rapid growth in national prosperity and greatness, <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> wrote his <persName n="Address,,Farewell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="default:Address,Farewell,,,"><foreName>Farewell</foreName> <surname>Address</surname></persName>, warning against what constantly loomed up with gloomy portent in his imagination &mdash; sectional alienation and geographical parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It never occurred to him that a free people would brook an administration of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> by sectional organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>He seemed to consider that the success of a geographical party in seizing the powers of government, would of itself be a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>; and thus, that very <persName n="Address,,Farewell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="default:Address,Farewell,,,"><foreName>Farewell</foreName> <surname>Address</surname></persName> of his speaks trumpet tongued the duty of the <rs>South</rs> in the present emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00242" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName></hi> entertained as lively a fear of dissolution from the same cause, declaring that the introduction of the slavery question into Congress <q>&#x0022;fell upon his ear like a fire bell in the night.&#x0022;</q> He regarded the introduction of the subject there as lighting the flames of a conflagration which must consume the whole fabric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>So far from having extinguished the flame, what has Congress not done to feed and magnify it?--He saw that the edifice of Union must disappear; for he felt that the <rs>South</rs> was too spirited to brook an assault upon her domestic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>These very fears of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00243" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName></hi> become now a lesson of duty to the <rs>South</rs>; for, if we submit to what he thought our manly instincts would rebel against, we are not the people he esteemed us to be. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>,</hi> as well as his great compeers of '<num value="37">37</num> and '<num value="50">50</num>, was equally emphatic in his deprecation of the slavery agitation, as a lover of disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>His most thrilling outbursts of patriotic eloquence were drawn forth by the lively apprehensions of disunion, which he entertained from this cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>His estimate of Southern spirit was the same as that of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>.</hi> He predicted inevitable dissolution from the agitation, if it was not brought to an end in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It has gone on till <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; and the <num value="6">six</num> seceding Gulf States have but accepted the recourse indicated by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>.</hi> The departed fathers of the country look down from their present exalted abodes upon these seceding States, doubtless with regret, but without <num value="1">one</num> word of reproach; and every word they ever uttered in deprecation of sectional warfare, and in prediction of dissolution, is a word of burning shame to the <name>States</name> that linger and debate, and vex the spirit of their people by leaving undecided the question of which side they will join. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> There is no alternative for secession on the part of all the <rs>Southern States</rs>, short of a popular declaration in good faith from the <rs>North</rs> that they hate us no longer and will agitate against our domestic institutions no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>No scheme of compromise that does not virtually convey this language from the <rs>Northern</rs> masses to the <rs>Southern</rs> people will be worth the paper it is written on. If the <rs>Union</rs> can be preserved by an empty abracadabra of words, which shall leave all the present bad blood festering in the bosoms of the sections, and the angry agitation now rife widening and still widening the present gaping chasm of popular alienation, then <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00248" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><surname>Clay</surname></persName></hi> were indifferent judges of human character, and the <rs>Southern</rs> people fitter material for vassalage and serfdom than they esteemed them to be. </p> </div3>

This is altogether unprecedented, and were it at all appropriate that the <rs>Executive</rs> should depute a committee for any such purpose, in obedience to the spirit of our Constitution, which proclaims the civil superior to the military power, civilians, and not military men, should have been selected for the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>But poor old <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Hope,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName></hi> seems determined that there shall be no lack of <q>&#x0022;fuss and feathers&#x0022;</q> on the approaching inauguration.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> The papers have teemed with the note of preparation of a warlike character in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for the defence of the public property from some apprehended attack, as well as to assist in the <name>Inauguration</name> of the <rs>President</rs>, there being some vague ideas entertained, or professed to be entertained, of a purpose to obstruct that ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>These flimsy pretexts are filling the <rs>Federal</rs> city with soldiers, and the array on the day of the <rs>National</rs> humiliation will be as grand and sonorous as martial display and martial sounds can make it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> The day is to wind up with a grand ball, in which it is complacently said that there will be a dance of <q>&#x0022;all-hands around,&#x0022;</q> i. e., of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If there be not a great many links of the grand chain absent, it will be because there are mercenary impostors present who have no right to represent them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> Your note submits to me the important inquiry, whether the relation which the naturalized citizen holds to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, by reason of his oath at the time of naturalization, is different from that which exists in the case of any native-born citizen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>And whether the <num value="1">one</num>, any more than the other, owes allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--which would make his assent to an act of secession by a State improper or treasonable and against his oath and obligation of allegiance? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> I feel no hesitation, in reply to your question, in stating, that all citizens, native and naturalized, stand upon the same basis in their obligations to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, and are, in all respects, equal; and that there is no such thing known in this country as an oath of allegiance to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, or to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by a foreigner, in order to his becoming a citizen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/> The oath, which the law requires of the applicant for naturalization, is <q>&#x0022;that he will <hi rend="italics">support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>;</hi> and that he doth absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to every <hi rend="italics">foreign</hi> <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Potentate</foreName></persName>, State or Sovereignty whatever, and particularly, by name, <rs type="role" reg="Prince">the Prince</rs>, Potentate, State or Sovereignty, whereof he was before a citizen or subject.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> He abjures all allegiance to foreign powers; but he swears no allegiance to the <hi rend="italics">Government</hi> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> It is true he swears to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>So does every officer of Government, Federal and State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> ever swears <hi rend="italics">allegiance</hi> to any <hi rend="italics">Government.</hi> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> requires her officers to swear <hi rend="italics">to be faithful and true to the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>,</hi> but not to hold allegiance to its Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/> The reason of this distinction is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>It is a cardinal doctrine of our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> system that all governments are <q>&#x0022;instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people,&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;when a government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.&#x0022;--</q>-[<rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">Bill of Rights</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> article. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, when she ratified the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>United</rs> , declared further, <q>&#x0022;that the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive to the good and happiness of mankind.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> Every citizen of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, under these solemn declarations, made when she was establishing her liberty and independence, and when she was ratifying the <rs>Constitution</rs>, must feel that he owes no <hi rend="italics">allegiance</hi> to any man, or set of men, who may hold power in the <rs>Government</rs>; and that they may be changed, and the <name>Governments</name> themselves be abolished, if inconsistent with the well-being of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> In the oath to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which the naturalized citizen has taken, he is not only not bound to allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but he is bound to support the <rs>Constitution</rs> against its violation by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The Government, in violating the <rs>Constitution</rs>, commits treason against the <name>States</name>, which formed it. It cannot be treason, then, in the citizen to overthrow these who traitorously violate a Constitution which he is sworn to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>On the contrary, it is his duty, and if his oath has any force in the matter, his <hi rend="italics">sworn</hi> duty, to aid his State in arresting the violation, and in maintaining the <rs>Constitution</rs> against the usurping Government, which tramples upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> But it is urged, I am informed, that the naturalized citizen is a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and not of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>This is a great error. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> Every man in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, only because he is a citizen of this <orgName n="State Congress" type="congress">State.--Congress</orgName> has power to naturalize for each State.--a power which each State exercised prior to the <orgName n="Constitution Congress" type="congress">Constitution. Congress</orgName> now, as each State had done previously, naturalized foreigners for each State; and the result is the same in each case: the foreigner becomes a citizen of the <rs>State</rs> where he resides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The law of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> makes every naturalized citizen resident in the <rs>State</rs> a citizen of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/> The Constitution provides, that <q>&#x0022;the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.&#x0022;</q> ;--Thus, the citizen of each State becomes the citizen of every State, in regard to privilege and immunity &mdash; and may well be called a citizen of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, because he is a native or a naturalized citizen of <num value="1">one</num> of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> Nor have I any doubt that every citizen supports the <rs>Constitution</rs> when he finds it necessary to favor a withdrawal of his State from a Union which has violated the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> Each State is bound to the other States by the bargain of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Each has the right to judge finally when the bargain has been broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>No State is bound by a bargain broken by the their parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>To defend the <rs>Union</rs>, in such violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is to oppose, not to support it. To withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> to protect the rights which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has reserved under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and which are violated by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, is the only way to support it left to the people of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, when she adopted the <rs>Constitution</rs>, declared as a part of her act of ratification, that whenever the powers granted by her to the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> should be <hi rend="italics">perverted to the injury and oppression of her people,</hi> those powers might be <hi rend="italics">reserved</hi> or <hi rend="italics">withdrawn</hi> by her. That was the condition of her accepting the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The other parties knew it; and that condition is, as to her, a part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Her right to withdraw, when her people are oppressed, is a part of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> for her citizens; nor can they doubt they support it when they shall support her in the exercise of a right which it reserved and secured to her. Nor can it be treason in them to obey her, who created the <rs>Government</rs>, rather than the <rs>Government</rs>, which is only her creature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>And it would be treason to her to refuse to obey her sovereign voice, should it be declared, for protecting her reserved rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, by secession from a Union which violated them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of a community of States, as each citizen is <num value="1">one</num> of the community of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>No <num value="1">one</num> denies the right of a citizen to withdraw from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in case she should oppress him. Every naturalized citizen has broken the bond of his former allegiance to secure his rights, violated or impaired in his native country, and his right to do so is recognized and protected by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The right of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to secede from the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName> is as clear as, I think clearer than, the right of a citizen to withdraw from his native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>The right of secession by a State is, therefore, stronger than the right of expatriation by the citizen. </p>
