<head>A Voice of Warning.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> Appearances in the <rs>North</rs> indicate a great and increasing disturbance in society, not less than in polities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> seem resolved to make a deadly struggle for the sceptre, which was so ceremoniously wrenched from their grasp <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago by the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>They threaten even to resort to arms at the polls, rather than be deprived of their just rights, and it has been intimated that blood will flow copiously at the next elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>In the meantime, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has taken the most effective measures to preserve the ascendancy his party has already required, and to render the success of the <name>Democracy</name> a matter of absolute impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>He has issued a proclamation emancipating <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the slaves in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and he calls upon them, almost in direct terms, to cut the throats of their masters, and unite with his <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> myrmidons in dividing the spoils.--This proclamation will have the effect of bringing out, in solid column, every <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> voter in the whole country now known as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and consolidating their vote upon candidates acceptable alike to themselves and to the ruling power at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It will have also the effect of stirring up the <name>Democracy</name> from the very depths of their inmost souls, to the fiercest extreme of rage and despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It may possibly lead to bloodshed, and from bloodshed to anarchy.--But, for this crisis <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has already prepared, with the calmness and deliberation of a man who has looked his situation fully in the face, and is ready to meet any consequences that may follow from his acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Contemporaneously with the <name>Emancipation</name> proclamation, he issued another, expressly designed to fit the case of all those who might presume, by mean of the ballot box, to attempt the over throw of the system he has inaugurated, and he has in his hands the military power necessary to carry it into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proclamation declares every man guilty of treason who interferes with the new draft which he has ordered, and turns all such persons over to the tender mercies of the <name>Provost</name> <unclear></unclear> It places in the same category all persons who, in any manner whatever, speak or act in derogation of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>In a word, it places the whole country subject to her Government under martial law, and, by suspending the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> enables his military officers to arrest all persons whatever whom they may suspect of designs not friendly to his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Candidates and voters of the <name>Democracy</name> lie absolutely at the mercy of any corporal who may happen to be in the neighborhood of the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>They can be arrested and incarcerated without the slightest hope of being heard, for any offence which the petty officer may choose to consider worthy of such punishment, or for no offence at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> It is not difficult to foresee who will be the victor in such a struggle as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>It is the old story a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times repeated, yet never to be exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Fury, collision, anarchy, blood shed, and repression by the strong arm of the military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Yet even should the <name>Democracy</name> succeed, we see not what <unclear></unclear> it would confer upon us of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They, as well as the <name>Abolitionists</name>, are all pledged to the subjugation of these States, for what they call <q>&#x0022;reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>&#x0022;</q> means that and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>No party dare enter upon a canvass without avowing a determination to pursue the rebellion to the utter extermination of all who persist in it. Those who tell us that Wall street will no longer afford facilities, because the prospect of recovering the rich grade from which it derived all its wealth is grown too dim to leave the vestige of a hope, and that when Wall street refuses there will be no more money &mdash; those who point to the high price of gold, and the fearful condition of the exchanges, as indicative of approaching bankruptcy, and consequently to the swift return of peace &mdash; those who believe they discover in the approaching anarchy and blood shed, with which the <rs>North</rs> is so evidently threatened, a relaxation of the preparations against us &mdash; seem willfully blind to <num value="1">one</num> of the most important lessons that history has ever caught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Throughout the <rs>French Revolution</rs> &mdash; the only event of modern times, which we can recollect, that bears any resemblance to what is now passing in the <rs>North</rs>--<num value="1">one</num> of the most renowned, at least, if not <num value="1">one</num> of the wisest statesmen that ever presided over the destines of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>--<persName n="Pitt,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="default:Pitt,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Pitt</surname></persName>, the younger &mdash; from week to week, made prophecies in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> precisely analogous to these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>And yet, in spite of this immeasurable debt &mdash; in spite of this irredeemable currency &mdash; in spite of intestine discords &mdash; she found means to shake every throne in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to its foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>No matter what Government might be in the ascendant &mdash; no matter whether the <name>States</name> generally or the <rs>Convention</rs> &mdash; no matter whether the <rs type="place">Mountain</rs> or the <name>Gironde</name> &mdash; do matter whether the <name>Directory</name> or <name>Bonaparte</name> &mdash; there was no intermission of military preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>La Vendee might be in open insurrection &mdash; the factions might fight pitched battles in the streets of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> &mdash; <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> might be the theatre of domestic war throughout its entire surface &mdash; but she never failed to keep up a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, and to deluge her neighbors with her armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>And the reason was that she deluded herself with the belief that she had a sacred mission to perform.--That mission was to overthrow the existing order of society and substitute the reign of murder and robbery, disguised under the specious title of Liberty age Equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>A revolution never turns back; it spends its rage and dies out. The <rs>French</rs> never ceased their aggressions until they were beaten so badly that they could go no farther. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> So it is now with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>They are determined to subjugate us if they can, and nothing will turn them from their purpose but drubbing after drubbing, until they become sick of the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Our people will indulge in a most fatal delusion if they allow them selves to believe for a moment that anarchy or even civil war among them, or bankruptcy, or anything else but repeated defeat, is going to put an end to their enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>These they will prosecute until too much exhausted to go farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Let us make up our minds to that conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Let us show them that we can he as fanatical in defence of our liberties, as they can be in assailing them. </p> </div3> </div2> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
