<head>The War news.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The news from the <rs>Southside</rs> this morning is important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>After several days of unusual quiet, the enemy, at an early hour on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, commenced a vigorous shelling of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and varied the practice by exploding a mine under our works on the <placeName key="possibilities=23" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Baxter</placeName> road, a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> from the city, by which he gained temporary possession of the salient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>While our loss of men by this exploit was not large, we regret to say that it includes a number of the members of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Pegram,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Pegram,R.,G.,,"><surname>Pegram</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But his triumph, if it can be called so, was short lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The invincible <rs>Mahone</rs> threw his veterans upon the enemy, recovered the salient and the <num value="4">four</num> guns with which it was armed, <measure n="12" type="captured">captured twelve</measure> stands of colors, <num value="74">seventy-four</num> commissioned officers, including <persName n="Bartlett,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> and staff, and <num value="855">eight hundred and fifty-five</num> enlisted men. We lost a few valuable officers and a number of gallant soldiers, but that is <num value="1">one</num> of the fortunes (or misfortunes) of war. At the close of the fight our lines were identically the same as before its commencement, all the ground lost in the morning having been reclaimed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The telegraphic dispatches announcing this brilliant success were received yesterday morning, and having been posted upon the bulletin boards, were perused with intense interest and satisfaction by throngs of our citizens, who were lavish in their praises of the gallantry of the troops in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The question most discussed was, what will <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> do next? --for since he has signally failed in his &#x0022;blowing up&#x0022; operation, he will undoubtedly resort to some other method of accomplishing his purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is apparent that he is nearly &#x0022;played out;&#x0022; for whilst mining is admitted to be a legitimate mode of warfare, it must be a desperate case which requires its adoption. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The foregoing news is confirmed by the following. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Official Dispatches.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> An official dispatch received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> states that at <time value="5am">5 A. M.</time> Saturday the enemy sprung a mine under <num value="1">one</num> of the salients on our front and opened his batteries upon our lines and the city of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In the confusion caused by the explosion he got possession of the salient, which was afterwards retaken and the enemy driven back to his lines with loss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> A later official telegram gives some interesting particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When we drove the enemy from the salient we recovered the <num value="4">four</num> guns with which it was armed, <measure n="12" type="captured">captured twelve</measure> stands of colors, <num value="74">seventy-four</num> officers, including <persName n="Bartlett,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig. Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> and staff, <num value="855">eight hundred and fifty-five</num> enlisted men. Upwards of <num value="500">500</num> of the enemy's dead are lying unburied in the trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Our loss slight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The <persName n="Bartlett,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> alluded to above lost a leg at the battle of <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>; but unlike <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, of wooden leg and turpentine ball notoriety, he has fallen into our hands unharmed, and will doubtless enjoy a prolonged period of rest and recreation in a Confederate prison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The <orgName n="Otey Battery" type="battery">Otey Battery</orgName> of this city was engaged in action on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and had but <num value="1">one</num> casualty--<persName n="Savage,IsFather,George,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Savage,George,M.,,"><roleName n="IsFather">a son of</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Savage</surname></persName>, wounded in the leg. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The ambulance train last evening brought over some <num value="220">two hundred and twenty</num> of our wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Up to the time the train left <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> everything remained quiet on the lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is thought that a good many of its men, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed to have been killed, were stunned and taken prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> We understand that our military authorities are well satisfied with the day's work, and believe it has spoiled <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s new plan for the reduction of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In the absence of official confirmation, we are not prepared to vouch for the truth of this report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The latest official advices represented that our forces occupied <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>, and there is probably no other foundation than mere rumor for stating that they have advanced from that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>When we do receive reliable news from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> we have no doubt that it will be favorable, and of a character to reflect fresh lustre upon Confederate arms. </p> </div4>

His despondency about the war and conquering the <rs>South</rs> is quite pithily expressed in the last entry made by him on the day of the battle: &#x0022;Well,&#x0022; said he, &#x0022;our cause is gloomy; we will conquer the <rs>South</rs> about the time the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> all return to <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>&#x0022;!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Why drive them to despair?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>After that, they will be too much occupied at last in their own defence and punishment, to undertake to assail or persecute anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The deceased General, however, meant not, we are sure, to depress the spirit of the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>He no doubt thought they would get back to <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>, but that the time that would pass away before that event would be sufficient to wind up the war and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> too.
