<head>The <rs>Southwest</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The situation of affairs in the <rs>Southwest</rs> justifies the expectation of some stirring events in that part of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at a very early day. The news received here, in an unofficial and unconfirmed manner, is that the enemy lad taken possession of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson, Mississippi</placeName>, our forces having evacuated it &#x0022;for strategic purposes.&#x0022; The latest Northern intelligence published by us this morning, however, announces that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had retired to the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, in consequence of the reinforcements of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is difficult to know what to believe from the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Accounts from that quarter are very unintelligible generally, and often contradicted.--<persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> would give up very reluctantly a position so ear and in the rear of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, against which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> malice is so powerfully directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Our own friends have given some very comfortable assurances as to the condition of things thereabouts, and we put faith in these assurances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We shall be sadly disappointed if in a short time we do not hear of some serious discomfiture of the ruthless enemy who has been so long man&#x0153;uvring to overrun a country and capture a city against which he cherishes an especial spite. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The latest Northern news received here brings the rumor that <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> has been sentenced by the drum-head court that tried him to <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> imprisonment at hard labor on the <placeName reg="Dry Tortugas, Monroe, Florida" key="tgn,2298652">Dry Tortugas, Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> discredits the rumor on the ground that the rigid rule of secrecy prevailing in such courts as tried him would prevent its decision from gaining publicity until made public by the court itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The same paper takes occasion to say that such a sentence would make certain Mr. V.'s election as <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> in the fall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> In the meantime there are indications of some popular excitement on account of <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName>'s arbitrary arrest and trial &mdash; especially in New York, where a large meeting had been held on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><persName n="Brooks,Mister,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Brooks,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, of the <hi rend="italics">Express,</hi> made a very strong declaration in his speech to that meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He said, &#x0022;In my judgment and belief it is not so much the intention of the <name>Administration</name> to subjugate the <rs>South</rs> as it is to subjugate the <rs>North</rs>!&#x0022; <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> is mistaken in this much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>That it is the intention to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>, and the execution of that intention renders it necessary to subjugate the <rs>North</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The very process demands the exercise of arbitrary power that is utterly inconsistent with freedom at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> must be free, or neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is impossible that the <rs>Southern States</rs> can be conquered and held as provinces by the <rs>Washington Government</rs>, while the <rs>Northern States</rs> retain their independent sovereignties under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The Federal Administration is certainly not more humane in its purpose towards the <rs>South</rs> than the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It merely ignores the <rs>State</rs> and personal rights of the <rs>North</rs> as a means to make more complete the crushing of all right, all justice in the <rs>South</rs>--the general subjugation, robbery, and ruin of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> is bold in his language, and may have to follow <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> to <persName n="Tortugas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Tortugas,nomatch:0"><surname>Tortugas</surname></persName>, if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has the courage to send him there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Will <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> order the sentence of the <rs type="place">Burnside court</rs> martial to be carried out, if that sentence has been correctly reported?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Whether he does so or not, be must suffer damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If he sends him to punishment, he must arouse a deep sense of outrage in the public mind, except amongst his own immediate party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If he fails to approve it, he will appear as too timid to enforce the natural and unavoidable decrees of the tribunal he has had the hardihood and tyranny to establish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>To what other termination could such a court, with such accusers, under <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s death order, arrive, than that of the cruelest imprisonment, or death itself, for publicly opposing the measures of the <rs>Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He must have known that such would be the result when he ordered such a court to try and punish such an offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If he now remits its sentence he will betray a fatal indecision &mdash; the sceptre will tremble in his hand &mdash; a woeful sign for the despot, and <num value="1">one</num> which is sure to lead to his downfall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> is certainly right as to the purpose of the <name>Administration</name> to subjugate the <rs>North</rs>--and to-day the <rs>Northern</rs> people are more in danger of permanently losing their liberties than are the people of the <rs>South</rs>.--That gentleman said that New York and <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> were the only free States in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The honorable gentleman may speak a little too fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It certainly has not appeared yet. The tyrant has not tried conclusions with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Those States have not yet failed to respond to his demands for troops to crush the <rs>South</rs>' and no issue has been fully presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>When <num value="1">one</num> is, if they prove their claim to be regarded &#x022;free and independent States,&#x0022; it will raise them high in the estimation of the world, and very much surprise us of the <rs>South</rs>!. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It will be seen in the compilation of late intelligence from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> published in our paper this morning that <persName n="Minister,,U.,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="default:Minister,U.,S.,,"><foreName>U.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Minister</surname></persName> <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Adams,Charles,Francis,,"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>, with a coolness and effrontery unattainable to any of human kind on earth save his own race, has repudiated his own act, or the unavoidable purport of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The British Ministry, always cautions and slow to express itself on question involving foreign relations, not only denounce the act as such, and pronounce it an unwarrantable exercise of authority over commerce, but they proclaim that they considered it so <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> serious an infringement of national rights so gross an insult to the <rs>Government</rs>, that they would hold no intercourse with <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Adams,Charles,Francis,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> on the subject, but would convey at once a &#x0022;statement of facts&#x0022; in the case to his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>As familiar, as the <rs>English</rs> are with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> duplicity and adroit cunning, they were no doubt amazed at this unblushing effrontery &mdash; this open and shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>It adds: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> The entire plan of the enemy is now being developed, and the attack is to be made below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The Federal gunboats have been run by the batteries, and so have the transports; the troops have been crossed over below, and now everything indicates that the <rs>Federal</rs> army and navy are slowly approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>While the army is to attack and carry our defences on the land, the fleet of gunboats is to assault our batteries and shelter the land army on the march. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> While this is going on below, it is probable that a similar demonstration is to be made by the gunboats above, and thus a battle line Will be formed on the river front <unclear>ext</unclear> <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> to the point <unclear></unclear> distance of twice <unclear></unclear> and perhaps clear across <unclear></unclear> at <placeName reg="Shyder's Bluff">Shyder's Bluff</placeName>, including <unclear></unclear> old battle ground at <rs n="Chickasaw" type="nativeamerican">Chickasaw</rs> Bayon. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> The internal resource of the <rs>North</rs> are so vast that there cannot be any doubt of its ability to continue its present policy, so long as the war party maintain their present footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The practical working of the conscription will test the temper of the people, but, unless it, or the other war measures recently enacted, lead to a rebellion in the <rs>Federal States</rs> themselves, there can be no hope of any wise counsels prevailing at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>On the other hand, the avidity with which the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> loan to the <rs>Confederates</rs>, on security of a portion of the cotton bought from the planters, has been taken up, is a strickling proof of the belief in their ultimate success entertained by <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> capitalists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The unity of purpose, ardent patriotism, and superior tactics of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, together with the immense advantages they enjoy over their opponents in the defensive war they sustain, in so vast and prolific a country, sided by the active co-operation of the people amongst whom they are fighting, abundantly show the futility of the attempt at their subjugation, Thus I cannot entertain any hope of a speedy cessation of the frightful struggle, nor of the release of the cotton hold in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The other causes which will probably tend to maintain the present high value of cotton manufactures are the now almost absolute certainty of our future supply of the raw material (from other sources than <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>) being much less than what has been calculated upon, and the probability that as the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> and other large foreign markets have already been so favorably affected by the falling off in the shipment hence, bey may be even further favorably influenced by the still greater diminution in their receipts, which must infallibly take place during the next <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> The stable &mdash; that haven of rest for the horse after the toils of the day &mdash; wherein he was always accustomed to eat his daily meals and lie upon his bed of straw, was entirely too uncertain and insecure on the day of impressment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>No stable escaped espionage, and consequently no horse found therein was allowed to remain by the insatiable officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Therefore, we understand, favorite animals were introduced into the cellar and dining rooms of private residences, and into kitchens; even the church, we hear, opened its doors to receive a religious horse, while those more rurally inclined, concealed themselves in the budding woods around the city, Nor was the tobacco factory forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>But in many instances the retreats were discovered, and all was over with owner and animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We venture to say, that on this occasion a new intelligence dawned upon these horses.
