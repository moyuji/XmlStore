<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>When the battle of the <date value="07-18">18th of July</date> was about to commence, as we stood in death like silence, awaiting the onset of the foe. I looked at <placeName reg="Milton, Norfolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014069">Milton</placeName> to see if I could detect in his countenance anything indicative of the emotions which certainly stirred my own bosom, and cast a pallor over almost every face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> Such is a brief sketch of some of the incidents in the history of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1VARegiment">1st Virginia regiment</orgName>--a burps incapable of performing the duties of a full regiment without imposing on its members a far greater amount of labor than should justly fall to their lot. The details for weeks past have been very heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>These details are made from the <rs>Brigade Headquarters</rs>, whence they are issued simultaneously to the several regiments and corps of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>They ought to be made with reference to the strength of each regiment.--Such does not seem to be the case, however; and as the numerical strength of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">1st regiment</orgName> is much less than that of either of the others, we are thus required to perform a double share of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>If we were only rated as a battalion &mdash; and we are scarcely more &mdash; the demands upon-us would be in proportion to our strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Than is it not wrong that a mere technicality should impose onerous and unnecessary burdens upon men who always have done and are ever willing to do their duty &mdash; their whole duty &mdash; and who have already exhibited their earnestness of soul by writing their names in characters of blood upon the page of their country's history ? --who came to fight, and not to drag out <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of their time in digging trenches, repairing roads, cutting wood, guarding wagons, or watching the sacred precincts of some <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">General officer</rs>'s headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Our ranks at each day's dress parade scarcely presents a front of <num value="100">one hundred</num> men. The rest, excepting the sick, are handling the pick, the spade, or the axe, or walking the monotonous beat of the sentinel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> Since the day on which we left <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">1st Regiment</orgName> has been constantly, in the advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>It has done as much, perhaps more service their any other regiment in the <rs>State</rs>, or, I may say. in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It has, through the untiring exertions of its officers, acquired a proficiency in drill not equalled by any other <orgName n="Volunteer Infantry" type="infantry">volunteer infantry</orgName> corps in the service, and the materials of which it is composed are such as never brought the blush of shame to the cheek of a gallant leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>There is plenty more of the same materials at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Then why do not our numbers increase, rather than diminish ? Is there any prospect of filling our ranks ? I answer, none, as things now exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>And yet it would be an easy thing to swell our numbers to <num value="1000">1,000</num> men within <num value="1">one</num> month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Scores of young men are willing, and even anxious, to join the army, for a variety of reasons, and would prefer entering this regiment to any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/><hi rend="italics">But.</hi> they have no idea of bidding good bye to their homes and friends, with no hope of returning until the expiration of their term of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>They have no thought of voluntarily becoming prisoners of war, such as they know us (of the ranks) to be.--Never was a greater mistake made by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, than the determination to grant no more furloughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>This has gone forth to the country, and the back ward ness of volunteers, as well as <num value="2">two</num>, <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the discharges and resignations, is entirely owing to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> It is hard to forget home, even when surrounded by scenes which enliven the soul and give ease and pleasure to the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>There are few men whose hearts do not turn to it with an almost irresistible longing when their bodies and minds are worn and vexed with the sights and sounds, the turmoil and discomforts of the camp and field, and it is an inexpressible relief to be permitted to return home, though it be for only a few days, Finding this impossible, and that the day of their deliverance is many weary months ahead, those who can do so, resign, while others, who are refused a short leave of absence, obtain discharges upon various pretexts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Others less fortunate, who can neither resign nor obtain discharges, become enervated in mind and body, and sink under the weight of their dejection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Many are rendered unfit for duty by no other disease than the <q>&#x0022;home fever,&#x0022;</q> and others who are slightly unwell from other causes become seriously ill as their minds revert to the tender nursing which, in former times, they received at home from willing hands, but which is now denied them by the inexorable decree <q>&#x0022;no more furloughs.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> Again, when the subject of maintaining or increasing the strength of the army is considered, it should be borne in mind, that the hour of enthusiasm is past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The idea of <hi rend="smallcaps">war</hi> has become a familiar thing, and while all good citizens are none the less determined to resist tyranny, and to defend all that makes life worth having , yet, those who did not yield to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse to rush to arms, those who were not swept away in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wave of popular excitement, are disposed to view the subject with a calculating eye.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It is true that the right of search exists in a time of war, and veers in the belligerent; but this forcible seizure of political prisoners, when under the protection of a neutral flag, is unjustifiable, and ought to be repudiated by the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>He gave the signals agreed upon, and received answers from the other brigades that all was right, yet when he reached the rebel camp he found it freshly deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The other brigades had failed in their movements, and <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, taking advantage of that fact, retreated through the unobstructed read before him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/> Having read in your paper several articles upon the extortion practised on the <rs>Southern</rs> people by speculators, I must add a few words to the general condemnation which these selfish and rapacious men undoubtedly deserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>It is a lamentable fact that in all times of public distress such characters are always to be found, and who, in seeking their own advantage, and striving to gratify their inordinate passion for wealth, become hardened, until they are proof against all natural feeling, and can with easy consciences make victims alike of rich and poor, citizens and soldiers, forgetting how these last have come from their homes in every part of the <rs>South</rs> and offered themselves, with their strong arms and stout hearts, in defence of their country's rights and interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Our community is not exempt from such characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>There are many engaged in the very <hi rend="italics">laudable enterprise</hi> of enriching themselves at the expense of their neighbors and fellow citizens &mdash; some, too, whom <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has already blessed with abundance, but who show more eagerness to add to what they have than those in moderate circumstances, with large families depending upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/> Now we all know that in times like the present the prices of many things must necessarily be advanced, not only on account of their scarcity, but also owing to the difficulty of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>To these necessities we are prepared to submit cheerfully; but there are impositions practiced upon us which try our patience and other <name>Christian</name> virtues most sorely &mdash; such as the suspicion that goods which were on hand at the commencement of the war have been concealed, not to be brought forth until our wants oblige us to pay any price for them that those who own them have the conscience to ask. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/> Salt is an article which is an absolute necessity, both to rich and poor; but the prices now asked for it places it far above the reach of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>It is brought here sometimes in considerable quantities, but appears and disappears with the rise and fall of the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>A review of these facts is painful, but it is our duty to put the stamp of a stern reprobation upon this passion for acquitting wealth at the expense of every right and honorable feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>It is a sad thing, too, that even patriotism is not proof against self interest; happily, as an offset to this, we have a few men amongst us who are deserving of all the honor we are glad to accord them &mdash; men who, exercising an almost <persName n="Fabian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00331" reg="mostcommon:Fabian,nomatch:0"><surname>Fabian</surname></persName> virtue, are resisting the temptation now offered to them of accumulating riches; but should peace ever again be ours, and we have the pleasure of seeing the banner of our young Confederacy hoisted with patriotic strains of music, and hear a national salute, proclaiming in thunder tones that our liberty and independence has been declared, then we will have it in our power to show our appreciation of their disinterestedness. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>The enemy are still occupying the other side of the river, and on the apex of the <rs>Mary</rs> land side of the mountain, they have an encampment and an observatory, from which they can overlook a wide extent of country; and, seeing our unprotected state, we have reason to fear they will take advantage of it to supply themselves with food, of which they are said to be very much in need. </p>
