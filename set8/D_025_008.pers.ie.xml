<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Our latest news from the armies below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> does not warrant the belief that there has been any grateful change in the situation of affairs since our leave of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The forces of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> occupy the position they assumed as early as <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, where he has the support of his gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> a demonstration was made against our pickets, which indicates a restiveness on the part of the foe in his present cramped and confined situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><num value="2">Two</num> pieces of the <orgName type="mil" key="LAGuardArtillery">Louisiana Guard artillery</orgName> were sent forward to the support of the pickets, when the enemy retired, without risking a shot from our <sic>pleces.</sic> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> It is not believed that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> can be induced to make an attack upon our forces, but it is concocted that he may attempt to throw his forces on the south side of the river, with a view to a demonstration upon the batteries at <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>.--Such a demonstration would, of course, be promptly met, and as signally thwarted as the advance of the <rs>Young Napoleon</rs> on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from the north side of the <rs>James</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> We conversed with a gentleman last evening who leave on time at <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Up to that hour all was quiet, and there were no outside indications of any active operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is reasonable to conclude that the fighting for a short season, at least, is at an end. There is nothing to justify the belief, however, that our Government will fail to improve its present advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><q>&#x0022;Pressed to the wail,&#x0022;</q> as the enemy now is, he will not be permitted to recover from the severe blow that has been inflicted upon him, and <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, in attempting to extricate himself from his present unpleasant situation, will and himself confronted at every point by an active and energetic army, under skillful and experienced officers, who are determined to wring from his unwilling masters' the recognition of their rights as freemen. </p>

<head>Fortifying.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> An exploration of the territory below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> recently occupied by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> furnishes abundant evidence of their unsurpassed skill in <hi rend="italics">digging.</hi> In fact, it was the boast of the <rs>Northern</rs> pagers, but a few short weeks ago, that the <orgName>army of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName></orgName> would dig its way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> before the <date value="07-11">11th of July;</date> but an unexpected reverse has caused a hasty abandonment of that cherished project, and now we are told that they are fortifying and laying off parallels some miles further from the <rs>Capital</rs>, adjacent to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is easy to imagine that plying the spade on such a sweltering day as yesterday is no child's play; and that such an occupation will steadily increase the enemy's morality list there can be no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Grave digging on an extensive scale will be added to their other labors, and in all their joyous anticipations of pleasant summer recreations in and around the metropolis, the luckless <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are doomed to a woeful disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A few days ago some gentlemen were conversing with a youth and prisoner at <placeName reg="Meadow, Loudon, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100298">Meadow Station</placeName>, when he commenced cursing very bitterly about the amount of labor imposed upon the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><q>&#x0022;Why,&#x0022;</q> said he, <q>&#x0022;they set me to work digging a ditch, which used me up in a hurry, and I <hi rend="italics">trusted.</hi>&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;You what?&#x0022;</q> asked a bystander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><q>&#x0022;Oh, I hadn't been used to that sort of work, and I <hi rend="italics">tuckered out.</hi>&#x0022;</q> Farther inquiry revealed the fact that this is a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> phrase to express excessive fatigue &mdash; an orthographical invention eminently worthy of a people who produced the euphonious <hi rend="italics">skedaddle,</hi> and have lately given us a practical illustration of it. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Treatment of our wounded.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> It is established beyond the possibility of contradiction, that a number of our wounded, after receiving their wounds, were deliberately murdered by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A gentleman of undoubted veracity, who was wounded in the fight at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor Creek, Westmoreland, Virginia" key="tgn,2248262">Coal Harbor</placeName>, says that after receiving his wound, which was but a slight <num value="1">one</num>, he succeeded in capturing a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldier, with whom he started to camp.--On the way they passed by a Texan officer, upon whom a mortal wound had been inflicted, and who was at the time well nigh exhausted from the loss of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The <rs>Texan</rs> expressed a desire to talk to the prisoner, which was allowed, and he addressed him, in substance, as follows: <q>&#x0022;I am about to die and what I state to you I know to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>When our brigade charged your lines, and was repulsed, a number of our wounded was left upon the field; and when your troops came up I distinctly heard your officer give the command to shoot in the head any wounded rebel on the field, and you obeyed the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I owe my own life to the readiness with which our men rallied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This statement I wished to make to you, in the presence of witnesses, that the facts may go out to the world.&#x0022;</q> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> was compelled to admit the truth of the statement, and acknowledged that such an order had been given. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Opening the lines of communication.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> We understand that the <name>Tappahannock</name> stage line, which has suspended business since the enemy occupied the country below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, will shortly regular operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This will afford facilities for refugees and others to communicate with their friends in the counties on the lower <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Persons came through from <placeName reg="Gloucester, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111950">Gloucester</placeName> last week in less than <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, and we learn from them that news of the great battle had reached that county, though the people were somewhat puzzled to ascertain the precise condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Notwithstanding frequent assertions to the contrary, the depredations of the enemy in <placeName reg="Gloucester, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111950">Gloucester</placeName> have been quite extensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Federal have no troops in <placeName reg="Lancaster, Lancaster, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013866">Lancaster</placeName>, and probably very few on the <rs>Northern Neck</rs>; but a steamer constantly plies in the waters adjacent, in order to prevent contraband trade between <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The late series of battles have already produced the good result of opening the lines of communication in various directions, as well as a visible effect upon the amount of supplies in our markets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Since the above was in type we have learned that the enemy evacuated <placeName reg="Gloucester, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111950">Gloucester</placeName>, after hearing of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s retreat, blowing up their magazine and throwing their guns into the river. </p> </div4>

<p> It will be perceived that the time has come for the <q>&#x0022;showing of hands,&#x0022;</q> and for the result I look forward with painful solicitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>I must confess I have been sadly disappointed in the evidence of loyalty that I expected to discover in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>I have watched with care the different places provided by the <rs>Government</rs> where the oath of allegiance could be taken, and, with a very few honorable exceptions, so far I have seen none of the substantial citizens present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>An apathy that is fearful, as unparalleled, everywhere prevails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Even among those whom I have looked upon as true Union men &mdash; men whom I expected would rush to place themselves under the flag &mdash; men who have, through the rebellion, lived in New Orleans and maintained the reparation of being opposed to the rebellion,--men who have even been daring enough to condemn the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders, and publicly decry the secession of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> as a National calamity &mdash; even such men are holding off, are practically, indeed, by their example, worse enemies to our cause than the open and defiant Secessionist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> Now, as the <q>&#x0022;order&#x0022;</q> I quote above really effects almost every prominent citizen, certainly all who are in the professions, and, comparatively speaking, none of these persons have as yet <q>&#x0022;made a sign,&#x0022;</q> and as they have so far pursued their various callings under the <q>&#x0022;powers that be&#x0022;</q> unmolested, what is to be the consequence if they refuse, or rather, if they imitate the majority of the population and maintain a stolid air of indifference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Our soldiers have had possession of New Orleans now nearly a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>In that time the peace of the city was never more perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Courts, though military tribunals, have been established that the most carping Secessionists admit have administered justice with the most impartial hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Life was never before so safe &mdash; crime, except among the lawless, the spawn, indeed, of the past political abuses of the city, has almost ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Our soldiers have been respectful to the citizens beyond any military precedence in the world's history. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> <rs type="role2">Private</rs> property has been scrupulously regarded; in short, all that could be done by human foresight, or by a paternal Government, to mollify or win over the substantial people of the city, has been done, in all so far without avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Not a flag has yet appeared raised by a citizen upon a public or private house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Many of the humbler classes would be glad to do this, I have no doubt, but a terror, a vague uncertainty prevails that paralyzes all demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The <rs type="place">Dead Sea</rs> is alone a fit physical emblem of the moral waste of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Again I ask, what is to be the consequence if the people named in the order above pay no respect to it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Suppose it falls a dead letter &mdash; then our cause, in my opinion, is almost lost; suppose it is enforced &mdash; then must commence rigorous measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It was usurped power that brought the people to the present condition; a constitutional, a superior power must be exerted and be felt ere New Orleans will range itself along with the loyal cities of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> Our friends would greatly oblige us by sending any Northern papers they may chance to get in their possession to this office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The public will thus receive the news at the earliest moment. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> The rise which this officer has suddenly taken in the public confidence is without a precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>At the commencement of the war he enjoyed the highest reputation of any officer on the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>But his fame was considerably damaged by the result of his campaign over the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The public was unable to estimate the difficulties with which he was surrounded, and was displeased with him because he did not accomplish what we are now convinced must have been an impossibility.--We confess we were of the number who allowed our previously high estimation of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to be considerably shaken, if not altogether overthrown, by the result of that expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>It was not until he was placed in a situation in which he had an opportunity to display his great abilities that he was enabled to teach the country and ourselves, as humble sons of the country, the folly of forming sudden judgments upon premises not sufficiently established. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> The operations of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> in the short campaign which is just over, were certainly those of a master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>No <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> that ever lived could have planned or executed a better campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It was perfect in all its parts and will be set down hereafter as among the models which the military student will be required to study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> labor was to render the city impregnable, which he accomplished so successfully that, in the opinion of military men, it could not be taken by double the force <rs>McClellan</rs> could bring against it. His next was to provide for the dispersion of the enormous force which threatened it from the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>How was this to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>To attack their fortifications in front was only to throw away the lives of his soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>To turn them with the force which he had under him here were an enterprise of infinite difficulty, since he would be compelled, in doing so, to expose his own flank, during the cross march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>In this dilemma, he fell upon the bold and original plan of bringing <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> down upon their right flank and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>But it was of the last importance to conceal this intended operation until the very last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The plan he devised was in the highest degree ingenious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It was generally believed that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, after crushing <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName>, was to march into the enemy's country and transfer the war to his own fireside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Means were taken to encourage that belief, and <num value="1">one</num> of then was to send heavy reinforcements to the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>When these had reached their destination, and everybody was expecting to hear the sound of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s cannon on the <rs>Susquehanna</rs>, the public were electrified by the magnificent <hi rend="italics">reconnaissance </hi> of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>From that <hi rend="italics">reconnaissance</hi> <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> learned all that he wished further to know, and while the public was still discussing the utility of an operation so full of hazard, the news arrived that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had sent to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> for all the cars, that he was at <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, that he was at <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, that he was at <placeName reg="Louisa Court-House">Louisa Court-House</placeName>, that he was at <placeName reg="Hanover Court-House">Hanover Court-House</placeName>, with all his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The truth then burst upon the public in its full effulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The enemy were to be attacked in flank and rear by <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s army at the same time that they were to be assailed in front by <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> with the main bulk of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The plan was worthy of the most renowned General that over lived, and even while it was in the very agony of projection, and had not yet been tried, no man doubted its entire success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>It did succeed beyond all reasonable hope, even of so wisely conceived an well-digested an operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Its success places its author among the highest military names &mdash; on the same roll with the <rs>Hannibal</rs>, the C&#x00E6;sars, the <name>Fredericka</name>, and the <name>Napoleons</name> of history. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> The perfect success which attended the efforts of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to keep the march of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> from the knowledge of the enemy is among the marvels of these marvellous operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The writer of this was aware that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was on the march for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as early as last <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> fortnight, when he heard that he was already at <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> with a portion of his forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>It is scarcely possible that fewer than then <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons knew the same thing at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>And yet not a soul was found to betray the secret to the enemy, and he was taken, at last, completely by surprise!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Was there ever such unanimity of opinion as this circumstance reveals?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Where is the <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> that were to show themselves as soon as the enemy made his appearance in force? </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>Our troops in the late battles.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> We have been, all our lives, devoted to that species of literature which consists in the description of battles and sieges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Consequently the quantity we have read in this department is greatly disproportionate to the quantity we have read in all other departments put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>We can safely over that we never read of any single feat, or any series of feats, either in ancient or modern times, that can at all compare with the exploits of our army on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, during the week ending with <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The storm of <placeName key="tgn,1121593" n="1.000 10" reg="Badajos,Amazonas,Norte,Brasil,South America">Badajos</placeName> was an achievement of unrivalled splendor at that day.--The <name>British</name> army has frequently, in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, accomplished enterprises in the way of storming that appeared impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>But when, before, did any army ever stern, <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> of redoubts and entrenchments, all constructed with the utmost skill, and defended with the most obstinate pertinacity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Our brave troops went on from redoubt to redout, and from earthwork to earthwork, without halting or looking to the right or left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>They lost heavily, it is true, but they accomplished far more than is to be looked for in the immediate results of their victory, enormous as they are. They established for themselves a name which will be of everlasting service to their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The <hi rend="italics">prestige</hi> of invincibility is theirs, and will remain theirs in all future time.--The moral is to the physical, says <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in the proportion of <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Their enemies, in future, will be half beaten before firing a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The very terror of their name will do as much for them as their bullets and bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Even if they had not succeeded in routing the enemy at all points, they would have gained much by the incomparable bravery with which they fought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> But they did rout the enemy at all points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>This is a fact which all the lying bulletins, and all the newspaper correspondence in the world cannot succeed in suppressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The world can see that the enemy had a line extending from a long distance above the <rs type="place">Meadow Bridges</rs> in <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs> in <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The world can see that all the formidable positions along that immense line have been abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The world can see that the whole route is strewed with the <hi rend="italics">debris</hi> of a broken and routed army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The world can see that the <orgName n="York River Railroad" type="railroad">York River Railroad</orgName> is in our possession, and that the formidable position on this side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, which was to be the base of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s advance upon the city, is in our hands. --The world can see the evidences of unparalleled disaster in the ruin of wagons, destruction of commissary stores, the relinquishment of tents, the abandonment of hospitals, the capture of <measure n="10000" type="prisoners">10,000 prisoners</measure>, the dispersion and disorganization of whole divisions, the piles of dead abandoned to our forces, the retreat of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Westover, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2114993">Westover</placeName>, and his reliance on his gunboats, after all his braggadocio, to ensure his safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers cannot lie the world out of its senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The world will see all this in spite of them all, and it will ask, if this be the fruit of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s victory, what sort of fruit would a defeat be expected to bring forth? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Be it so. We are in the hands of a General who has just proved himself a master in the art of war, and who has taught his countrymen, in the last fortnight, to place the utmost confidence in his skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>This city and the country generally feet safe as long as he is known to be at his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> Many brave and noble spirits have of late sealed their devotion to the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> with their life's blood, but none braver or noble than the subjects of this notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>LeBlanc I had known only since the organization of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 8">8th regiment</orgName> of <orgName n="Louisiana volunteers" type="volunteers">Louisiana volunteers</orgName>, more than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> since, and in that time I learnt to love and appreciate him. Always courteous, always affable and kind, he made friends of all who came in contact with him. Stirring and energetic, strict when the line of duty required it, and gentle and friendly to every man when off service, he was deservedly ranked amongst the best officers of his regiment and brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Through severe indisposition he was necessarily absent from his regiment and company during a great portion of its glorious career in the campaign of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00282" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>; and on his return to duty, when yet suffering some what from the malady that had detained him, much against his will, from scenes he ardently desired witnessing, he was fired by a noble ambition to so act as to more than compensate for his forced absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>On the bloody field of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="06-27">June 27th</date> he behaved, as all his friends knew he would, Handsomely and gallantly, and in the fight of the ensuing <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> he fell, where duty called him, in front of his company, fearlessly breasting the enemy's missives of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>All honor and respect, then, to the memory of that brave Louisianian, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> who answered his country's call for troops! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Were I to say all in his praise that inclination bids me say, I might be considered as too fulsome; but, after all, I would only have been doing justice to a friend, and <num value="1">one</num>, too, towards whom even partiality would be excusable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>His home was my home whenever I chose to make it, and whenever 'twas-in his power to aid and assist he did so unasked, and from the pure inspirations of his friendly heart.
