<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Yesterday we visited <num value="1">one</num> of the victims of this unfortunate affair, and find that though the facts were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> exaggerated, yet the case was still <num value="1">one</num> of a most serious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Some few nights since a party of gentlemen and ladies determined to have a convivial gathering and had assembled at the house of a friend on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, near the point designated above for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>During the evening, as most young men are apt to do, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> would leave the room, where all was pleasure and enjoyment, and, little thinking they were in pursuit of a deadly poison, visit a grocery located on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, just before you reach the <rs type="place">Fair Grounds</rs>, where they took several drinks of what purported to be whiskey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Everything passed off happily till a late hour in the evening, when <num value="1">one</num> after another began to complain of dreadful nausea at the stomach and dizziness in the head, and very soon thereafter the dance was suspended and the evening's entertainment came to an unpleasant end, as most of the young men who had partaken of the poisonous liquid had been taken to their residences in an unconscious stale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>After severe suffering, the most of them have recovered; but the deadly effects of the poison consigned <num value="2">two</num> of them to the grave, and thus left another warning that in the midst of life we are in death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Both of them were from <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, belonged to the army, and were young men spoken of highly by all who knew them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The gentleman with whom we conversed assures us that he only drank about <num value="0.5">a half</num> a wine glass full, and that he discovered a most peculiar and revolting taste at the time he swallowed it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It is a subject which should receive investigation.--There may be others in this city so reckless of human life that, for the sake of making money, they would also poison their whiskey that they might make greater profit on it, who would probably be deterred from doing so if the case above cited were promptly taken in hand, its particulars sifted to the bottom, and the parties blamable justly punished. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>If they proposed anything which the <rs>South</rs> could for a moment listen to, there would be the smallest possible hope that they could carry out anything that they proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The <placeName reg="Rochester, Monroe, New York" key="tgn,7014348">Rochester</placeName> convention was little more than a convention of dead men &mdash; dead in Yankeedom &mdash; appearing to the eye like the cadaverous figures of the stereoscope, looking as though their bodies were new-stolen from the charnel house, and dressed in fashionable attire, yet preserving the hideousness of death in their pallid faces. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Is the <rs>South</rs> simple enough to enter again a league in which her voice must be overwhelmed by the power of numbers, from which she was driven by injustice and oppression?--What fairness or justice could she hope from it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>No! it can never be. Could the <rs>North</rs> restore our land to its condition before the war &mdash; our houses, our groves, and our peaceful firesides, with their happy family circles &mdash; the lives of those noble and generous sons of the <rs>South</rs> who perished in the field contending with the riff-raff and scum of society from all corners of the civilized world, including our own slaves put in arms against us: if the <rs>North</rs> could and would restore all these, and add to it the property of which our people have been robbed, and then propose to incorporate in the <rs>Constitution</rs> protection against the selfish and unscrupulous power of numbers &mdash; of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> numbers &mdash; the <rs>South</rs> might begin to listen &mdash; might &#x0022;give ear.&#x0022; But nothing short of that should give her preference before that sure means of ultimate deliverance from a hated union with a people who have proved themselves capable of every enormity in the catalogue of human perfidies and cruelties, viz: <hi rend="italics">fighting.</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>They are <num value="2">two</num> wings of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>. <num value="1">One</num> is called War, and the other anti-war <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>[Precisely a political condition which the <rs>South</rs> has no idea of ever being placed in again!] There is really nothing in the efforts and power of these parties that encourages the idea that they are going to change the order of things at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of them enters for a moment into the true idea of State rights and State sovereignty, for which the present war was brought on. They ignore the constitutional principles by which alone the <rs>South</rs>, in the <rs>Union</rs>, could hope for protection against Northern domination and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>In short, they are all sufficiently imbued with the <rs>Northern</rs> idea of the supreme centralized power of the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to sustain <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in his usurpations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>All their efforts are but a continuation of the old scramble for office &mdash; for the public plunder of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Their clamors against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> are with regard to special and vague issues on minor points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They fight just cautiously enough to keep up a show of opposition and an organization, whose whole strategy is designed to take possession of the offices and the plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Whenever they are brought into immediate collision with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, as on the draft, they back out. For a little show of resistance they make a general concession touching the crushing of the rebellion and the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, which goes to strengthen <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and still further advance his plans for permanently occupying the <name>Presidency</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> The South has nothing to hope directly from these Northern divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>No Southern man who takes a proper <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> view of the subject can hope for reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> with these people of the <rs>North</rs>.

Sooner or later they must break forth, and the sooner the better!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>While there are individuals and small bodies of men who are honest and true, and whose feelings towards us are such as deserve our kind and friendly consideration, we should be distrustful in the general of those demonstrations which appear to arise in some degree from sympathy for us. <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sympathy with the <rs>South</rs> is sympathy for its <hi rend="italics">trade</hi>--they want a beast of burden &mdash; a balaam &mdash; a donkey &mdash; to bear their load of taxation &mdash; a submissive ox to come under their yoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> Modest and unassuming, he never referred to the motives which animated him to hazard all for the cause he loved; but upon the battle-field, when the hail of death fell thickest, he stood like a pillar of steel, untrembling amidst the fiercest of the conflict, evidencing to his comrades a determination to die &#x0022;like a brave man&#x0022; rather than to &#x0022;cower in the dust&#x0022; in the presence of the most deadly foe. To strike for liberty at his own altar and at his own fireside amidst the blaze of enthusiasm filling a devoted land, and encouraged by the hope of having his native hills and smiling valleys &#x0022;the land of the free and the home of the brave,&#x0022; is <num value="1">one</num> of those principles lodged in the breast of man through whose influences he is animated in the darkest hour of trial.
