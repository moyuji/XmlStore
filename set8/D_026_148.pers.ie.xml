<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>An officer who was present furnishes a version totally different from any we had previously heard.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> This is the statement of an officer who was present, and who may be presumed to have been well posted in regard to the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>On the other hand, the impression at headquarters, yesterday was that a severe fight took place, resulting in our favor, and in the capture of several pieces of artillery in the multitude of prevailing rumors, it is a matter of exceeding difficulty to obtain a correct knowledge of the situation. </p> </div4>

<head>The Telegraph Company and its rates.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The recent increase in the rates charged by the <rs>Southern Telegraph Company</rs> has been the cause of some dissatisfaction in the public mind, which has found utterance through the press in various quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is surely not the part of window to condemn any party without a hearing; and while we are ready at all times to denounce what may property be denominated extortion, candid examination of the facts in this instance cannot fall to remove the impression upon which the allegations against the company are based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>These allegations are, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that the company has increased its rates <num value="2">200 per cent</num>, within the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, which is deemed unjustifiable at a time when gold was falling; and, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, that there has been no corresponding advance in the prices paid to employees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Now the balance sheet of the <rs>Treasurer</rs>, for the year ending <date value="1864-04-01">April 1, 1864.</date> shows that the expenses of the company during that year exceeded the receipts by more than <measure n="43000dollars" type="currency">$43,000</measure>. The reason of this is <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> that while the general rates have been increased <num value="3">300 per cent</num>, upon peace prices, and the rates to the press only <num value="1">100 per cent.</num>, the expenses have increased from <num value="400">400</num> and <num value="5">500 per cent</num>, (on the case of salaries of employees) to <num value="4000">4,000</num>, <num value="8000">8,000</num> <num value="20000">20,000</num>, and even <num value="360">36,000 per cent</num> on certain articles used by the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The salary of a superintendent has been increased from <measure n="125dollars" type="currency">$125</measure> to <measure n="625dollars" type="currency">$625</measure> per month, and that of a chief operator from <measure n="75dollars" type="currency">$75</measure> to <measure n="375dollars" type="currency">$375</measure> per month &mdash; an advance of <num value="4">400 per cent</num>; and while the pay of an assistant operator in peace times was <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> per month, it is now <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>--an increase of <num value="5">500 per cent.</num> The salaries of the <rs>President</rs> and Treasurer remain the same as they were at the beginning of the war. The advance in prices of articles indispensable to the business of the company is still greater, reaching, as an inspection of the items will show, from <num value="3000">3,000</num> to <num value="330">33,000 per cent.</num> To these facts might be aided the seizure of long lines of wire by the military authorities for their own use, and the heavy expense attending the reconstruction of lines destroyed by raiding parties of the enemy; but enough has been said to justify the company, in the mind of any candid man, in advancing its rates, and to relieve it of the charge of monopoly and extortion, which has become very common with those who do not take the trouble to investigate the circumstances. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> But the last and greatest efforts of the foe are yet to be adverted to. The faithful <hi rend="italics">Express,</hi> of this city, has already given you diurnal statements of the situation, which will supersede the necessity of my speaking in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> We are sometimes disposed to think that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have really no hope of subduing us. Indeed, were it not that their case is desperate in a financial view, unless they can succeed in appropriating and confiscating our whole country, we should remain firmly rooted in that opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Were it otherwise, we cannot conceive why they should spend so much labor and time in devastating territories which they hope to call their own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Nay, to such an extent is our hypothesis true that the most furious patriots are always to be found in those localities upon which the hand of the enemy has been most heavily laid.
