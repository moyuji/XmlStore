<head>The Apprehending campaign.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> The spring campaign on the <rs>Potomac</rs> is about to open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The hopes of our army are buoyant, its spirit high, its courage undaunted, its condition admirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Every man depends upon himself, has confidence in his officers, and knows that he will be sustained by his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They have a General who has never sustained a defeat, and an enemy whom they have never met but to conquer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They are <num value="1">one</num> and all, officers and men, impressed with the belief that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are about to make their final effort, and that if they fall they will no longer have anything more to fear from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They are eager for the commencement of active operations, and impatient of the unavoidable delay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> On the other hand the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will open the campaign with a much smaller comparative force than they have been accustomed to. With all their boasting, and all their lying, we are confident that they will not greatly outnumber <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> when the hour for action shall have arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They cannot add greatly to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s force without detracting greatly from the force of some other General, a plain proof that their resources are on the wane, if not already approaching the point of exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>At what point soever of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00275" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s line &mdash; in front, in flank, or in rear &mdash; they may make a demonstration, they will most assuredly be met with forces very nearly equal to their own, and we do not believe it possible for a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force however well commanded and appointed, to beat an equal force of Confederates, let them be appointed and commanded as illy as they may. The chances are therefore vastly in <hi rend="italics">our</hi> favor, and there is but <num value="1">one</num> circumstance which renders their chances as good as they were when the campaign of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> opened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> That circumstance is the possession of a General superior to any they have ever yet had.
