<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Under ordinary circumstances all would have been confusion, but in this instance nothing of the kind was perceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Officers and men seemed to vie with each other in coolness and promptness.

<head>The enemy's latest Schemes.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> The enemy falling in all his expedients &mdash; his foreign enlistments; his negro regiments; his negro insurrections; his divers proclamations of amnesty, etc., and, above all, in his battles with our Southern troops in the field, has introduced a new piece of strategy in the war. It is Famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The mills, the corn tribe, the barns, and the substance and support of the people are to be destroyed to starve them into submission to their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The teams and the labor of the country are to be carried off, and the <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs> are to be burned that there shall be no more seeding and harvesting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> A fitting counterpart to these designs of the <rs>Infernal Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was the plan to massacre the officers of Government here and to sack and destroy this city, as developed in the <name>Dahlgren</name> papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Had the purposes of the invaders been known to our people no prisoners would have been taken, and that they were not hung up instantly, all that were in our hands, upon reading what those purposes were, is an example of forbearance of a community under the extremest provocation that has hardly a precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Whatever is done about this raid and its participants in our hands, it would be madness to suppose any future expedition of the sort towards this city comes with any other purpose than that which lured on the band of cut-throats under <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="nearbymention:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="nearbymention:Dahlgren,Ulric,,,"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, Of course every man can answer, and rightly, what should be our policy and duty when such another occasion arises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> But the orders enjoined on the whole route those acts of barbarity which are intended to starve the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Not only all the mills were to be burned, but everything that could be of service to the rebels was ordered to be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The acts of these raiders and their orders are only in conformity with the deeds of all the invaders in every part of the country, especially in the last year of the war. There is no way to meet this kind of warfare but by the most summary punishment of every man caught in the act of its prosecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Every commander under whose authority such deeds are committed should be put to death immediately he is caught and his criminality clearly established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>This may check the outrages and compel the enemy to respect the rules of modern warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>On the other hand it may inaugurate a system of bloody retaliations.
