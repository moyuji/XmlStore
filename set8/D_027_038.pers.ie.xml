<head>The question of Negro recruiting in the <rs>New York Board</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> An interesting discussion took place in the <name>Board</name> of Supervisors of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, last week, upon the question of recruiting negroes at the <rs>South</rs> for New York's quota.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The following is a sample: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> A circular from the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal-General">Provost Marshal General</rs> of the <rs>State</rs> to the <name>Supervisors</name> of the several counties was read, recommending recruiting in the rebel States, and the payment of bounties of <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">two hundred and fifty dollars</measure> to each recruit so obtained, and <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> to the agent procuring the recruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>This recommendation was given for uniformity and to avoid competition, which might be injurious. </p> </q><bibl n="The South for New York's quota"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> Supervisor Little moved that the subject of appointing agents to recruit for the county in the rebel States be referred to the <rs>Committee</rs> on Volunteering, with instructions to report at the next meeting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> Supervisor <placeName key="tgn,2101155" n="1.000 48" reg="purdy, mcnairy, tennessee">Purdy</placeName> hoped the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> would never engage in the business of enlisting negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>He characterized it as trafficking in human flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>We are able to perform the duty of maintaining the <rs>Union</rs> without following the example of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> in kidnapping poor negroes to have them slaughtered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> Supervisor Little replied that the object was merely to recruit the army and fill the county quota without being obliged to resort to a draft of our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>There are white men in the rebel States as <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> well as black men, and there was nothing to lead any <num value="1">one</num> to believe that we want to recruit any particular color of men, if we do agree to recruit in the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> After some further discussion the resolution offered by Supervisor Little was adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> Supervisor Shook then moved that the county still continue to pay <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">three hundred dollars</measure> to every man liable to draft who brings a substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>After some opposition from Supervisor <placeName key="tgn,2101155" n="1.000 48" reg="purdy, mcnairy, tennessee">Purdy</placeName> it was adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> Supervisor Shook then moved that those who deposit money with the <rs>Volunteer Committee</rs> to procure substitutes, have said substitutes provided for them, the money to be paid to the parties bringing the substitutes to the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Adopted. </p> 
<p> Supervisor Shook offered a resolution that the <rs>Committee</rs> on Volunteering confer with the <rs>Police Commissioners</rs> on the best plan of filling the quota of the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Adopted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The Courts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, as well as the several States, have almost universally decided that domiciled foreigners were liable, and the practice of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> is governed by those decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It is evident Congress intended the act of <date value="1861-04-21">April 21, 1864,</date> to include all residence, except temporary sojourners, and international laws cannot after that intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>[Here copious definitions of domicil are cited.] Such questions are difficult of decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Unless the petitioner shows otherwise, the residence of a party is <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> domiciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Why did he vote?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Probably he thought himself entitled to vote because of long residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Surely his vote would not have been received if he had been so drunk as not to know what he was doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> thought he was domiciled in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and liable to conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>While he may not be a naturalized citizen, he is, nevertheless, domiciled, and his expressions of intention to return to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> do not rebut the domicil arising from long residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The active movements of a body of cavalry on an expedition into the enemy's country to obtain supplies are quite fatiguing, and induce a sufficiently strong desire for repose and relaxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>In addition to this, if there be anything like excessive indulgence in eating and drinking, it may be well supposed that the inclination to drop the inconvenient discipline of the camp for a season is almost irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Nothing but the most persevering watchfulness and rigor of superior officers can prevent a relapse of this sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>No command of the kind can resign itself in this manner to ease without peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>This has been proved so often by actual results that it is surprising that any officer should want another lesson to teach him the chief danger in a raiding expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Yet we are called upon, every now and then, to record still another lesson for all who have charge of such enterprises.--Are we never to have an end of &#x0022;disgraceful surprises?&#x0022; If men will not, or cannot, be prevented from excessive indulgence, cannot officers, knowing their great responsibilities, themselves enforce enough of order and watchfulness to avoid such discreditable and disastrous surprises?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It is no consolation to us that the enemy occasionally meets with the same misfortune.
