<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> It is false, infamous, slanderous, beyond endurance, that a man's reputation should be at the mercy of scavengers employed to visit the lowest haunts of vice to get up items for the local editorials of irresponsible newspapers, to parade before the country libellous and slanderous falsehoods like these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I do not object to the controversy, but i avail myself of this opportunity --until the letters shall be produced here upon which the course taken is bases, if there be any such in existence &mdash; to denounce them as forgeries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I enter upon no defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I intend none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We have had enough of this kind of business already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I deny the duty or the right of members to rise here and call for investigations upon irresponsible statements like that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I did intend, as members near me know, to make the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> explanation in my Congressional career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I desire that this matter may be fully reported in the gallery, so that my defence may go forth with the charge made on this floor &mdash; the infamous statement, that I have been in correspondence with any <num value="1">one</num> in that State, and uttered sentiments inconsistent with my duty, not only as a member of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, but as a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--<num value="1">one</num> who has taken a solemn oath to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and which, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I never deviated from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>So far as the charge contained in the article in question is made against a member of this <name>House</name>, even a suspicion &mdash; an ordinary suspicion &mdash; would justify such an investigation as this resolution contemplates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I do to know whether the gentleman occupies properly or improperly a seat on this floor.--By offering the resolution I do not prejudice him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>But, sir, the charge does come before us in a fair and unquestionable shape.--It appears as an original article in the <orgName n="Baltimore Clipper" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">Clipper</hi></orgName>, and is, therefore, presumed to be editorial, or at least under the immediate supervision of the editor, and that makes it emanate from a responsible source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But I suggest, further, that the suspicion against the newspaper in question, and the seizure of the office where it was published, was made under the direct authority of this Government, and it is to be presumed that the effects of that office are at this time in the custody of the <rs>Government</rs>, or agents of the <rs>Government</rs>, and that, therefore, the information communicated in this paragraph must have come through the <rs>Government</rs> or its agents, and it is, therefore, responsible in its origin, as far as we can judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I repeat it is, so far as it appears, a direct charge by the editor of a responsible newspaper, and comes before us, we must believe, from the <rs>Government</rs> or its agents, and is, therefore, more than common fame. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Within the ensuing period the army has increased to nearly half a <num value="1000000">million</num>, and has been raised, organized, officered, armed, paid, clothed, and equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Hundreds of cannon have been made; powder, saltpetre and sulphur factories and armories have sprung into existence under the auspices of the <rs>Government</rs>, and the whole service been placed in a condition of efficiency that has excited the surprise of the civilized world The position of <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> was considered <num value="1">one</num> of the most arduous and responsible under the old Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> It is true that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> did not take his place until some time in the autumn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>That he has addressed himself to these difficulties with almost superhuman energy cannot be questioned, Fully impressed with the arduous responsibility of his position, he has tolled from an early hour of each morning to and beyond midnight; in he has not allowed himself even the rest of a Sabbath, Nor has this been more toil without accomplishment; for he has not turn <unclear></unclear> but turned out an amount of labor truly </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/> This is the man that it is proposed to displace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Who will take his place, and fill it more worthily?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>who has his shrewd common sense, his keen perception his wonderful power of analysis, his perfect acquaintance with the law and usage of his department, his patience to listen, his industry to ascertain, and his quickness to decide, joined with his habits of labor, and a power of physical endurance that enables his to bear <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure> of the severest mental labor with unflagging energy &mdash; for all these requisites are indispensable to the position?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Let me tell those who propose to supplant him, that the amount of labor he performs each day would drive <num value="19">nineteen</num> men out of <num value="20">twenty</num> to the mad house! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/> And for what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Because <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> have fallen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Let us look into the justice of this reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>The former was defended by <num value="4">four</num> forts and <num value="20">twenty</num> pieces of artillery, bearing upon the only channel available to the <rs>Federal</rs> gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>This channel was further obstructed by piles, which were never forced until after the surrender, and the whole defended by <num value="3000">3,000</num> men. The Federal forces <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attacked these forts, and were repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Their only way to carry them was the <num value="1">one</num> finally adopted &mdash; to land an overwhelming force on the south end of the island and attack the forts in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>But to do this they had to pass over a narrow causeway, half a mile long, protected on each side by an impassable morass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Here comes in a fact of great significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>This report says that <q>&#x0022;the forces under <persName n="Henningsen,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="mostcommon:Henningsen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Henningsen</surname></persName>, with <num value="15">fifteen</num> pieces of artillery, were ordered to <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName>, but that the unfortunately misunderstood his orders and stopped at <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth City</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> There can be no reasonable doubt that his force and his <num value="15">fifteen</num> pieces of artillery were to defend this identical causeway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>There can be no doubt that if those <num value="15">fifteen</num> pieces of cannon had been placed so as to command this cause way that it would have swept away any enemy that dared venture upon it, and thus changed what became a sad disaster into a glorious victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Thus we see that the <rs>Secretary</rs> had provided the means, but that the plans were frustrated by the mistake of a subordinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Is he, then, to be held responsible? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/> Now, also <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>The position is acknowledged to have been a very strong <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>It was defended by <num value="3">three</num> forts, which Northern accounts admit to have been powerful, and <num value="17000">17,000</num> of the finest soldiers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, commanded by able and experienced <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>These forts and these men successfully defended the position for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>--each day repulsing the enemy, until they accumulated a force said to be <num value="70000">70,000</num> strong, when our troops and forts were overpowered and captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Who believed the <rs>Federals</rs> could concentrate so large a force upon that point?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Who believed that <num value="17000">17,000</num> men and those forts could be captured?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The simplest among us can see it now, but who saw it then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Again, if more men and more cannon were required there, where were they; to come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The only forces in this department were at <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Donelson</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>If they had been moved from the former, the entire <placeName reg="Mississippi Valley">Mississippi Valley</placeName> would have lain at the feet of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> There is another point that must not be overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors of the <name>Dispatch</name>:</hi>--In this day of our necessity, when our country has a right to expect every man to do <hi rend="italics">his</hi> duty in expelling the invader, it is painful to the leniency and accommodating action of the country militia surgeons in exempting from military service large numbers of active hale able bodied men, who have had no complaint to make until the militia are about to be called out. It is amusing, if not disgusting, to hear the frivolous excuses offered by those who wish to stay at home in inglorious sense and safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Some have a pain in <num value="1">one</num> place, some in another; some have a small scar from accident, some are too fat, some too lean; some are lame salt, blind, and deaf, but not dumb, who previously passed for likely, active, healthy men. I intend to personalities, but a <rs n="General Description" type="misc">general description</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>The writer has been informed that almost entire companies in different counties, have nearly become valetudinarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>In <num value="1">one</num> company, numbering about <num value="60">sixty</num>, when the <rs>Captain</rs> gave the order, <q>&#x0022;Invalids, advance to the front&#x0022;</q> about <num value="40">forty</num> stepped forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>In another company, numbering about <num value="60">sixty</num>, also, the order was given, <q>&#x0022;invalids, advance to the front.&#x0022;</q> In obedience to the command, every man stepped forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>At this, the <rs>Captain</rs>, much surprised, informed his men that they had misunderstood him, and after explaining its meaning, repeated the order with the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>He then remarked, <q>&#x0022;my company is broke&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/> It is notorious that the surgeons exempt a very large proportion of the application for exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>There are many slight defects which do not disable a mad from efficient service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>If a man <hi rend="italics">has</hi> had a bone broken, without very great deformity in its cure, it does not disable; and many other defects do not really disable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>A single reducible bernis, for instance, is but a slight inconvenience, and should not entitle a man to discharge from service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/> The whole business ought to be revised by the <rs>Government</rs>, and rules prescribed; and the examining surgeons ought <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be examined themselves, and sent from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the camps, or a different county.--This would obviate the objection which could be raised to a resident surgeon as the acquaintance, friend, and neighbor of the <unclear>in l.</unclear> Surgeons from a distance could have no motive to act otherwise than impartially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>There is no wish or intention to put in service men who are <hi rend="italics">really </hi>disabled or unfit for duty, but many men have been exempted who are as capable of doing military duty as many in the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The Government ought to take steps to remedy the <unclear></unclear> by revising properly all previous exempts <hi rend="smallcaps">Justice.</hi> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>If this plan were put in operation zealously, here would soon be no need of recruiting officers or of drafting the militia.
